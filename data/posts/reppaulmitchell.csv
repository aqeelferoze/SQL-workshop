Key in our efforts today is the Small Business Health Fairness Act, which I am proud to cosponsor.  Small businesses have been hit particularly hard by Obamacare’s mandates, high costs, and limited choices. Small business owners – who want to provide health care for their employees – frequently tell me that they are struggling to do so because of Obamacare.  The Small Business Health Fairness Act would level the playing field for small businesses by allowing them to band together to increase bargaining power to get lower health insurance costs for their employees.   In addition, this bill includes strong protections for patients with pre-existing conditions, a top priority of mine and my colleagues as we work through the health care reform process.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/reppaulmitchell/photos/a.135929056905063.1073741828.110852796079356/185218365309465/?type=3",NA,11,7,5,0,0,0,0,1

Stay safe everyone!   The winds are forecast to continue until 7 - 8 p.m. tonight and additional outages are expected.  Safety is always a priority. Stay at least 20 feet away from all power lines and anything they may contact, and consider them live. They are extremely dangerous. Treat every downed power line as if it is energized. Heed the warning of yellow caution tape, which indicates there is a downed power line in the area. DO NOT CROSS YELLOW CAUTION TAPE.   DTE Customers have three ways to contact DTE during an outage. Customers can report an outage, check on the status of an outage and view an outage map from their smart phones using the DTE Energy Mobile App, which is available free of charge from the Apple Store or Google Play. DTE encourages customers to use the website at dteenergy.com as well. Customers can also call DTE at 800-477-4747 to report power outages or downed lines.   Storm Tips:   ·   Never drive across a downed power line. If a power line falls on your vehicle, remain inside until help arrives. ·   Always operate generators outdoors to avoid dangerous buildup of toxic fumes. ·   Turn off or unplug all appliances to prevent an electrical overload when power is restored. Leave one light switch on to indicate when power is restored. ·   Don’t open refrigerators or freezers more than absolutely necessary. A closed refrigerator will stay cold for 12 hours. Kept closed, a well-filled freezer will preserve food for two days. ·   If a customer is elderly or has a medical condition that would be adversely impacted by a power outage, they should try to make alternative accommodations with family or friends.","status",NA,NA,20,1,2,0,0,0,0,0

Paul Mitchell","2017-05-03","2017-05-03 20:50:07","Earlier today, I spoke on the House floor to express my disappointment that Congress needed to resort to a massive funding bill to prevent a government shutdown.  The choice before us was stark and binary: we could vote to shut the government down, or we could vote for this massive funding bill.    Neither was a good option, but shutting the government down would stall military pay, and send a sign of weakness to the world.  At a time when North Korea is becoming increasingly aggressive, Europe is unstable, and Russia is posturing, we cannot afford to shut down.  This was a hard vote, but unavoidable at this point. We must continue to pay our troops and other uniformed personnel.    Though imperfect, this legislation funds some critical programs including an increase in defense spending, funds to fight ISIS, increased resources for border security, funds to fight the opioid epidemic, and cancer research funding.  It also includes funds for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and funds to study the potential invasion of Asian carp into the Great Lakes – both are important programs for Michigan.   Given today’s options, I voted to keep our government open, but I am calling on my colleagues to end the series of short term funding measures, address the shortcomings in our appropriations process, and develop better solutions for the future.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaulmitchell/videos/217873735377261/",NA,34,93,5,1,0,0,0,3

Families living under the Affordable Care Act have seen their premiums, copays, and deductibles continue to rise. Doing nothing was not an option.    I know from business; rarely can you achieve the ‘perfect’ deal. Perfect doesn’t exist in negotiation.  Over the past few weeks, changes have been made to improve the American Health Care Act.    This final legislation delivers relief from the burdens of the Affordable Care Act, while reaffirming our commitment to ensuring all Americans have access to care.  The American Health Care Act eliminates the Affordable Care Act’s mandates and taxes and establishes a system of incentives through tax credits, rather than punishing individuals for not purchasing insurance.    Those who do not already receive coverage from their employer, Medicaid, or Medicare, are eligible for tax credits to help them purchase insurance.   It has long been a priority of mine to ensure that all Americans, especially those with the highest health care needs and costs, are protected. This legislation targets funds directly to support those who need it most.  Giving states the flexibility to make that happen is critical to lowering premiums and guaranteeing access for everyone.","status",NA,NA,70,360,27,6,0,0,7,209

Choosing whether to go to college, and how to pay for it, is one of the most important and costly decisions in a young person's life, made more difficult by all the uncertainties involved.  Currently, you can find more information about a washing machine you're thinking of buying than you can find about an educational major at a college or university.  Most people say they choose to go to college to start a career.  Yet, they don’t have answers to basic questions like: How likely are they to graduate? How long will it take to complete their degree?  How likely are they to find a job? How much will they earn?  As a parent, I know this information will be helpful. That's why I introduced the College Transparency Act, to help families make more informed college decisions.

Kate’s Law would enhance the current maximum sentences for illegal reentry for criminal aliens who illegally reenter the United States.   - The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act would deny Sanctuary Cities eligibility for certain federal grants and would allow the families of victims like Kate Steinle to sue jurisdictions who release aliens who later commit a murder, rape, or felony with a sentence of a year or longer.  This bill also includes Sarah and Grant’s Law, named after Sarah Root and Grant Ronnebeck. This provision would ensure an alien be detained after the alien is arrested for or charged with a crime that caused death or serious bodily injury of another person.  This would prevent what occurred in Sarah Root’s case, where an unlawful immigrant who was driving while drunk crashed into Sarah’s car, was freed on bond by the State while Sarah was in the hospital.  By the time Sarah died of her injuries, the alien was long gone and has not been seen since.","video","https://www.facebook.com/HouseRepublicans/videos/10154809099816608/",NA,55,27,0,2,0,1,1,12

The passage of this legislation marks the first time in the last decade that the House has completed the full appropriations process on time.

The fiscal path we are on is not sustainable.  It jeopardizes our future, our children’s future, and our national security.  We must be responsible now, before it is too late.  We can make cuts to our government without impacting essential programs.  In fact, the right cuts will grow our economy by stopping over-eager bureaucrats from crafting more job crushing regulations.   During debate of the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, I proposed three amendments to rein in excessive spending.  My amendments were a modest 10% cut to administrative and bureaucratic accounts at several federal agencies. These cuts, when combined with similar measures, would yield taxpayers big savings without cutting projects or essential programs.  Moreover, my amendments focus on agencies that have been problematic in the past, including the rogue IRS with its history of unfairly targeting groups based on their political beliefs.  My measures were a serious and long overdue effort to combat Washington’s spending problem.  I am disappointed that they were not adopted as part of today’s legislation,  but I remain committed to the fight for fiscal responsibility.

The core of the Second Amendment is self-defense, and the ability to carry a firearm outside your home is a critical component of that Constitutional right.    Unfortunately, law abiding citizens who choose to carry a firearm are subject to a confusing patchwork of state laws that make it difficult to travel with a firearm.   Our other Constitutional rights, like Free Speech, are not restricted by state lines.  Similarly, our Second Amendment right should not end at a state border.  That’s why I cosponsored and voted for the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act (H.R. 38), which passed the House of Representatives today.   This legislation simply affirms the right of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves in other states as they can at home.  This practical legislation prioritizes the rights of law-abiding citizens to conceal carry and the ability to travel freely between states without worrying about conflicting state codes or onerous civil suits.  More broadly, this legislation ensures that our Constitutional rights apply throughout the United States.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reppaulmitchell/videos/307715379726429/",NA,132,107,21,12,0,1,0,38
