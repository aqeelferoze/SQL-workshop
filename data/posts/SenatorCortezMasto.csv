I’ve spent my career in public service fighting to protect Nevadans, and I intend to use my seat at the table to ensure our state’s working families have a voice who will always stand up for them.   I will fight tirelessly for the causes I campaigned on: fixing our broken immigration system while keeping families together, defending women’s health and rights, investing in education, protecting the retirement security of our seniors, fighting discrimination, and getting secret unlimited money out of our democracy. My number one priority will be building a stronger economy with new jobs, growing wages and tax fairness for the middle class so that every hard-working family has a shot at success.   Right now I’m laser-focused on listening to our state’s residents about their challenges, ensuring a smooth transition with Senator Harry Reid, putting together a great team to serve our constituents, and getting up to speed on my new committee assignments","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorCortezMasto/photos/a.1289170824459988.1073741828.1283446251699112/1289168121126925/?type=3",NA,346,57,185,65,0,1,0,0

Congress should be focused on creating good jobs, growing our economy and strengthening the middle class – not using women’s health care as a political football.   Since Republicans also want to slash funding for community health centers, they will have to explain why they want to deny so many American families affordable access to services like cancer screenings, birth control and STD testing.

Instead of trying to work with both parties to fix our broken immigration system and actually grow our economy, President Trump is choosing to demonize Latino communities and baselessly fear-monger about the phantom threat of undocumented immigrants. Instead of seeking to be a President for all Americans, President Trump is using his first week in office to try to further divide this nation and placate his most extreme supporters.  Among the many controversial actions announced today, President Trump is directing his Administration to move forward with building an incredibly costly and ineffective border wall that will do nothing to improve our national security and that Mexico will never pay for. President Trump wants to start punishing cities that refuse to use local law enforcement as immigration agents, a move that would undermine basic community policing policies and threaten urban economic development. Instead of focusing our homeland security resources on larger priorities like terrorism and cybersecurity, Trump’s first priority is ramping up his deportation force that will tear hardworking families apart.  Make no mistake: I firmly believe in securing our border. However, I am afraid this is just the first step in what will be a pattern from the Trump Administration of putting tough talk ahead of smart, thoughtful immigration policy. Republicans have repeatedly insisted that if they controlled Washington, they would pass legislation to reform our immigration system and meaningfully tackle all aspects of this issue. So far, all they have done is sit back and let Trump dictate his flawed agenda.

Yet, today, women still only make 80 cents on the dollar. While our nation has made progress to close the gender pay gap, we still have work to do. It is unconscionable that woman still have to work over three more months to match what their male coworkers made in the previous year. And the pay gap for women of color is far worse.    We need to build an economy that works for all our families, and when women earn less than men for the same work, it holds all of our communities back. This gap makes it harder for too many Nevada women to put food on the table, pay their bills, save for a secure retirement, and get ahead in today’s economy.   Our country was founded on the notion of equality - and in the year 2017, it's unacceptable and against the law when women are not paid the same as their male counterparts. On Equal Pay Day, we must reaffirm our commitment to closing the wage gap, and continue the work to build economic opportunity for all our families and close the gender pay gap once and for all.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorCortezMasto/photos/a.1289170824459988.1073741828.1283446251699112/1379989632044773/?type=3",NA,47,15,10,1,3,2,4,2

The Senate GOP are in a backroom drafting a repeal – with zero transparency or opportunity for the American people to weigh in. Let me be clear: Trumpcare will devastate the lives of millions of people. It will result in less access to care at a higher cost. For many – the Affordable Care Act is saving their lives. That includes a 5-year-old girl named Keaton from Las Vegas. Keaton suffers from Gastroparesis, a paralysis of the stomach with no cure. Thanks to the ACA, Keaton is able to receive the care she needs.    If there ever was a time to use your voice on what the Affordable Care Act means to you, now is the time.

Now, it is time for our community to come together to bring comfort and relief to those families. We must do everything we can in this community to continue to support them. This includes supporting the ongoing investigation that needs to take place, independently. We must let law enforcement officials do their jobs. There will be plenty of time to second guess. There will be plenty of time to play politics. But right now is the time we all come together as a community to support and comfort all those affected by this tragic event.

She was one of my greatest inspirations. Her work in our Las Vegas community is one of the reasons I decided to pursue a career in public service.  In the 1990s, she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The experience of caring for my grandmother opened my eyes to the true impact of this disease.

Through their military experiences, they learned virtues of service, integrity and respect—values that they instilled in my sister and me. When my dad returned from his service in the Army, the G.I.
