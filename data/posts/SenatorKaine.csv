By indefinitely suspending the Syrian refugee program and imposing a religious test at our borders, he has defied everything our nation stands for. He's also weakened our national security by empowering ISIL's narrative that the West is at war with Islam and encouraging the listed countries to further cooperate with adversaries like Russia and Iran. For decades, America has acted as the Good Samaritan and extended a welcoming hand to those who yearn to be free. We should continue to thoroughly vet all refugees who enter the United States, but we cannot abandon our core principles. If we turn our backs on widows and orphans fleeing the very evil we despise, we do not defeat our enemies; we surrender to them.  It is also incredulous that at the same time the President is asking the Pentagon for new options to defeat ISIL, he is banning Iraqi refugees from entering the country. The government of Iraq is our ally in the fight against ISIL. Its troops fight alongside ours. Its interpreters risk their own lives and the lives of their families to protect U.S. personnel. It undermines our national security and endangers our soldiers to have our Iraqi partners and other Muslim countries distrust our commitment and motives. President Trump said he was ‘totally against’ the U.S. invasion in 2003, which led to Iraq’s destabilization and the rise of ISIL. I guess he is not ‘totally against’ leaving its people to suffer the consequences.","status",NA,NA,52515,3654,10902,2967,96,129,6778,1614

There is nothing more cowardly than targeting institutions where our children go to learn and thrive. I want to express my deep solidarity and support to America’s Jewish community and to all who are victims of hateful threats and actions. I strongly condemn these terrifying incidents, which must be rejected.  It is no coincidence that we are witnessing a rise in hate speech and crimes targeting minority groups in America, including more than 100 bomb threats against Jewish entities since the beginning of this year and a 67% increase in hate crimes against Muslims in 2015. Divisive political rhetoric has sadly contributed to a climate where individuals who espouse hate feel emboldened.    The Administration must speak out clearly, consistently, and forcefully against the rising tide of anti-Semitism and hate crimes impacting communities across our nation. But words are not enough. I urge the Administration to outline to Congress and to the American people how it plans to respond to this threat, including bringing to justice the individuals or groups behind these incidents, and taking the necessary steps to effectively deter these threats in the future.","status",NA,NA,3060,240,503,53,2,11,826,257

This is deeply disturbing and demonstrates, once again, the need for a full and independent investigation into all contacts between the Trump Campaign, the Trump Administration, and the Russian government.

This is directly relevant to Virginia, given the Navy’s nuclear powered aircraft carriers and submarines constructed and stationed in Hampton Roads as well as the BWXT Nuclear Operations Group manufacturing facility in Lynchburg.

Later, I visited the Children’s Hospital of the King’s Daughters in Norfolk to spend time with patients, parents, and doctors. They voiced fears over what cuts to Medicaid would mean for the families of almost 600,000 kids in Virginia who depend on it. On such a critical day for the future of health care in our country, I was glad to hear from those who TrumpCare could have affected the most. I ended my trip at Hampton University hearing from cyber students and Hampton University President Dr. Harvey. We need to expand scholarships in cybersecurity because well-paid jobs that will help our county tackle cyber security challenges are going unfilled.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorKaine/photos/a.594079410641156.1073741845.482778861771212/1251147671600990/?type=3",NA,514,34,15,37,0,1,0,0

I'm constantly looking for opportunities to hear directly from Virginians so I can advocate for our communities back in the Senate. In Waynesboro, I visited with providers, volunteers and seniors at the  Valley Program for Aging Services to talk about how cuts have already caused them to close their doors for meals on Fridays, and President Trump's budget cuts would cause them even more pain. Afterwards, Glenda and I bagged bread for Meals on Wheels America delivery next week. Her volunteer work makes a huge impact on seniors in the Valley. Afterwards, I drove to Staunton and got an update on Staunton Crossing from Mayor Carolyn Dull. President Trump's budget could hurt future projects like this that are critical to economic development. President Trump's proposals to eliminate the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Economic Development Administration, USDA rural water funding, and Community Development Block grants would also leave rural Virginia behind. I'm going to do everything I can to stop that from happening and see to it that our communities have the tools to succeed. Along the way, I got to make a few unannounced stops too. Rhonda at Jake's Bar & Grill told me all about how she opened the restaurant to honor her son who was killed in action in Iraq. She is the epitome of perseverance. Delicious burgers and good people! And while I was around the corner, I dropped by Wayne Theatre to tour the historic building. I was honored to sign the wall alongside some of the great performers who have passed through. And this afternoon on my way back home, I made a pit stop to catch up with old friends at Vinyl Fest 2017. A cool gathering of folks listening to the entire Kinks Katalogue.

President Wilson delivered his War Address to Congress on April 2, 1917 and by April 6 both bodies of Congress approved a declaration of war against Imperial Germany. Congress did not declare war out of a desire to send nearly five million U.S. servicemembers overseas and over 116,000 to give the ultimate sacrifice, but rather they did this because it was their solemn duty outlined in the Constitution that sending servicemembers overseas to fight for their country deserves a public debate and decision by their elected representatives. We must always have an eye to the past as we consider our approach to current events. I’m proud to cosponsor this resolution commemorating the U.S. entry into WWI 100 years ago today.

We thanked brave first responders who had seen the unforgettable horror of classrooms filled with bullet-riddled bodies, many with ringing cell phones in their pockets as frantic family members tried to reach them.   In the days that followed, I decided to form a panel of experts to investigate everything that happened that day and issue a complete public report outlining what went wrong. The report was unsparing and comprehensive. It led Virginia to make some changes in mental health and privacy laws. It inspired changes in campus safety protocols around the nation that are still used today. We learned that a flaw in our background records check system had allowed the killer to purchase a weapon even though he was legally barred from doing so due to a court judgment that he was mentally ill and dangerous. I was able to make a partial fix to our system via executive order but efforts to create a truly comprehensive background check system have failed in Virginia and Congress again and again.   That time created a bond with so many of the Virginia Tech families. I continue to be in awe of their strength and resilience, and I cherish their continued friendship all these years later. Today, on the tenth anniversary of the tragedy and on Easter Sunday, we remember the victims, survivors and heroes. #VTWeRemember","status",NA,NA,861,31,68,166,1,4,245,1

I sat down with miners from United Mine Workers of America last week in Castlewood to discuss my efforts in the Senate. Over the past few weeks I reintroduced Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA) of 2017 to ensure that claims for benefits for coal miners and their family members are processed in a fair and timely manner, and I am fighting every day to ensure we find a resolution on miners' benefits before government funding runs out at the end of this month. Having conversations face to face with retired miners about the fear caused by uncertainty around their health care re-energized me for the fight and I'm going to tell every one of my colleagues about the visit until we get to a resolution. http://www.wcyb.com/news/kaine-meets-with-retired-miners-in-swva-to-discuss-future-of-healthcare-pensions/450136689","link","http://www.wcyb.com/news/kaine-meets-with-retired-miners-in-swva-to-discuss-future-of-healthcare-pensions/450136689","wcyb.com",611,27,56,35,0,3,15,0

His budget senselessly makes cuts to grants that fund the Meals on Wheels America program at a time when it needs our support. When President Trump's budget chief Mick Mulvaney said Meals on Wheels is ‘not showing any results,’ I was floored. Not only are thousands of meals handed out by volunteers to feed Virginia's seniors in-need every week, but the volunteers provide a regular check up on older Virginians who may not have someone to stop by and provide companionship or even just to help replace their smoke detector battery. In Waynesboro, I joined a volunteer, Glenda, who said she had received just as much out of the program as she had put in - and the volunteers who wrote these letters clearly feel the same way I do. At the event, one service provider told me that one year of Meals on Wheels funding, which helps to keep seniors in their homes, costs the same as nine days in a nursing home. We need to make smart budget decisions, not cuts that hurt communities across Virginia.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorKaine/photos/a.485279704854461.1073741826.482778861771212/1274418615940562/?type=3",NA,540,31,91,33,0,6,12,37

Today the House rushed the TrumpCare bill through without waiting to hear how many millions of people would lose health insurance and protections for pre-existing conditions, how high premiums would go up for seniors and how much the deficit would explode. If they cared about health care, they would care about how this bill affects people's health. But what they care about is giving a massive tax break to the wealthiest, paid for by slashing health care for everyday people.  “The Senate should put this bill into committee, let the CBO study it, hold hearings to hear from doctors and patients and engage in a meaningful bipartisan effort to improve health care.

After promising not to cut Medicaid, Trump’s budget would slash the program, which provides more than one million Virginians – including more than 594,000 kids, 112,000 seniors, and 186,000 people with disabilities – with health care, and make drastic cuts to programs like Social Security and Meals on Wheels that support those in need. It would cut nutrition assistance that keeps the poorest Americans from going hungry, take away job training initiatives that are critical to American workers’ success, and hurt the environment and our tourism industry. Trump’s budget would cause disproportionate pain in the rural communities he promised to help - including those in Southern and Southwest Virginia and the Valley - by eliminating the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Economic Development Administration, and clean coal research that could help revitalize Southwest Virginia’s economy.    It’s particularly disappointing that President Trump ignored the concerns raised by Virginians and local organizations across the Commonwealth that highlighted just how painful these cuts would be to their communities. I will work with my Budget Committee colleagues on both sides of the aisle to prevent these harmful, short-sighted cuts.","status",NA,NA,637,180,197,9,1,15,169,426

Today’s CBO score confirms again that the Republicans’ TrumpCare bill breaks those promises. Twenty-three million Americans would lose their health insurance by 2026, 14 million fewer people would have Medicaid coverage, and markets would become unstable for one-sixth of the population by 2020. These aren’t just numbers; this bill would cause families in Virginia to lose health insurance. This comes one day after we saw President Trump break his promise not to cut Medicaid by proposing a budget that would slash this critical program, which provides health care for more than one million Virginians, including nearly 600,000 kids. We have to hold President Trump to his promises or Virginians will be stuck with the painful consequences. I hope my Republican colleagues in the Senate will drop their backroom efforts to pass a bill without input from patients and providers, and instead bring Democrats to the table so we can make bipartisan improvements to the nation’s health care system.","status",NA,NA,664,147,193,6,6,11,124,303

I want to share this story from Jen, in Sterling, who wrote to me about her daughter, Cailyn. We can't let Republicans unilaterally pass #TrumpCare and devastate Medicaid. Her story below:  ""Cailyn is a 9.5 year-old who was born one week late and within a week we knew something was wrong. She was sleeping all the time and not eating, then she started having seizures and was diagnosed with a seizure disorder.     ""At 3.5 she was diagnosed with a non-inherited genetic anomaly called STXBP1 which affects a binding protein in her brain, causes seizures uncontrolled by medicine and severe developmental delays. She functions approximately on the level of a 6 month old. She can't walk, talk or feed herself. She is total care and even has a feeding tube as well as multiple medications that keep the seizures to a minimum.   ""Our lives revolve around her disability and her care and even changed my career path. After 20 years in communications I moved to a full time job as a disability rights advocate and educator three years ago.   ""When Cailyn was a little more than a year old we applied for and she qualified for a Medicaid Waiver. Medicaid serves as secondary insurance for Cailiyn and covers what our primary insurance provided by her Dad's employer doesn't.    ""A few examples include: her wheelchair which costs more than my first car, her hospital bed which primary insurance paid nothing for and then also feeding tube supplies which cost approximately $6,000 a month.   ""We were never looking for a handout. My husband and I have both worked since we were teenagers. We both pay taxes and we need this assistance to keep Cailyn home with us, living in the community and not in an institution. Our lives would be vastly different if we didn't have Medicaid.  I wouldn't have been able to continue working--she has nurses and caregivers that Medicaid helps pay for, we wouldn't still own our own home--the financial consequences would be too much."" - Jen","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorKaine/photos/a.485279704854461.1073741826.482778861771212/1338678622847894/?type=3",NA,544,56,174,110,1,5,100,5

He was then able to apply for DACA the first year it was enacted and has been working with a technology company as a software developer ever since. Ricardo is now studying at GMU to get his Computer Science degree.   Renata came to Virginia when she was three years old with her parents, older brother, and sister. She graduated high school with an IB diploma and now, with DACA, she is able to study at George Mason and is pursuing her dream of getting a degree in clinical psychology. Renata also works at a brain injury service doing research on TBI and PTSD.   These young people are making America stronger.

Stories like these are why we can’t repeal the Affordable Care Act, replace it with Trumpcare, and dismantle the Medicaid program like the Graham-Cassidy proposal does.   “Ana is currently 4, though she will very excitedly tell you that she's about to be 5 on October 1st. She is so full of life and love for the world and people around her. She's extremely smart, funny, observant, imaginative, creative, and empathetic, and doesn't know a stranger. She makes friends literally everywhere we go. Ana loves all things princess, dance and music (singing or playing instruments), animals, drawing/painting, and adventuring. She adamantly wants to be a veterinarian one day.   “Ana's medical diagnosis - congenital heart defects including: HRHS (Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome), transposition of arteries, VSD) - means that she is missing the right ventricle from her heart. She underwent 4 major open heart surgeries as well as numerous less-invasive procedures. Her blood flow was corrected so that her heart can now pump oxygen throughout her body sufficiently as she grows. Without these procedures, she would not have lived more than a week. While she looks and acts normal from the outside, she will always have only 1/2 a heart and will always carry the risk of requiring a transplant later on in life.    “As a single mom going through grad school, I am fortunate to have employer-based healthcare at this time. But, beyond grad school, I am looking to venture out on my own into my own practice eventually in the medical service industry (behavior therapist/analyst), and there is a very real possibility that I will either have to rely on exchange-based healthcare or provide my own as a self-employed individual. Without the ACA, these probabilities become extremely daunting and could possibly stall my ability to change careers and chase these dreams. Beyond my own ambitions, without the ACA Ana runs the risk of either hitting her lifetime cap before she even becomes an adult, or having to choose between healthcare/future procedures/living and chasing her own dreams (college, life events). No child should have to choose between living and fulfilling their own ambitions.""","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorKaine/photos/a.485279704854461.1073741826.482778861771212/1415076631874759/?type=3",NA,614,83,76,149,2,4,54,3

The news this week of an independent investigative report into the March 2016 murder of Honduran activist Berta Cáceres demonstrates how vital it is to strengthen efforts to combat corruption in Honduras. There is an urgent need for those responsible for Berta’s brutal murder to be held accountable and brought to justice through a transparent process. Sadly, Honduran activists who defend the environment and promote human rights continue to face intimidation, threats and attacks.  This is simply unacceptable, and more must be done to protect the rights of activists and journalists and ensure their security so that Honduras can move forward on the path of democracy. https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/11/02/Report-finds-evidence-of-broad-plot-against-Honduran-activist/7841509625278/","link","https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/11/02/Report-finds-evidence-of-broad-plot-against-Honduran-activist/7841509625278/","upi.com",189,52,28,6,1,17,96,2

If Republicans go through with repealing the individual mandate in their harmful tax bill, it will make the situation so much worse and raise premiums even higher for families like these.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorKaine/photos/a.485279704854461.1073741826.482778861771212/1479944642054624/?type=3",NA,582,195,96,15,16,2,100,61

What an accomplishment. Rob, a double amputee, wants other wounded veterans to know that they have an important role and many opportunities for success in the country they have sacrificed so much for. Proud to call him a Virginian.
