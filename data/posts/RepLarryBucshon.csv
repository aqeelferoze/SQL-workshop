It includes the largest increase in border security technology and infrastructure in a decade, gives our troops the largest pay raise in six years, and fully funds the health benefits for retired miners that are set to expire. While this legislation is far from ideal, it nonetheless makes progress getting our priorities in order after eight years of the failed policies of the previous administration.  I wish we could have done more in this bill, but the arcane rules of the Senate allow Senate Democrats to block our efforts to make further progress.

In doing so, Senator Sanders questioned the fundamental beliefs Christians around the world have held for centuries, and attempted to establish a litmus test that would disqualify any person with similar beliefs from serving in government.    Although this has been mostly overlooked by the media, every American, regardless of their religious beliefs, should be outraged.   Article VI of the United States Constitution maintains that “no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.” Furthermore, the First Amendment guarantees the right of all citizens to exercise their religious beliefs freely and peacefully, stating that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”   Implying that the government should have a religious litmus test that may disqualify a person from service in the government is dangerously close to overstepping this constitutional boundary and represents a slippery slope that threatens the rights of every American. The freedom of religion extends to people of all faiths and we must all vigilantly protect it as such.   This dangerous and intolerant attempt at political correctness by Senator Sanders should be admonished by all Americans.","link","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/bernie-sanders-chris-van-hollen-russell-vought/529614/","theatlantic.com",65,74,62,0,6,5,6,60

To turn things around, the Secretary of the VA should be able to hold bad employees accountable, which is made nearly impossible under current law. The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act is landmark legislation that ensures bad actors are terminated or held accountable and whistleblowers who bring forward misconduct are protected. This legislation builds off our work to provide robust funding and badly needed reforms that improve the care delivered to veterans after several scandals involving VA-provided care came to light, like the atrocities we saw at the Phoenix VA. Our previous work combined with the legislation we passed today go a long way to ensuring veterans receive the timely and quality care that they have earned through their service.  I’m happy President Trump supports this common-sense measure and intends to sign it into law.","link","https://bucshon.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/dr-bucshon-supports-landmark-va-accountability-bill","bucshon.house.gov",54,23,14,6,0,0,0,0

Furthermore, his unilateral, unconstitutional action only served to further complicate a broken immigration system in need of overhaul and created uncertainty for the people he intended to help.  Innocent young adults should not be held accountable for the illegal actions of their parents and we need a permanent solution to this challenge. As the Trump Administration made clear, immigration laws must be deliberated and passed through Congress, not implemented through executive fiat.
