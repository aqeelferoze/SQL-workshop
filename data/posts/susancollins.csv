I was so fortunate to eventually come to know Mary as a friend, and as someone who dedicated her life to helping others – especially those living with Type 1 diabetes. As international chairman of JDRF, Mary testified at many of the Children’s Congresses that I held in the Senate.  Mary endured the ups and downs of Type 1 diabetes for so many years, but she never focused solely on her personal struggles with the disease.  Instead, she focused on finding a cure to help improve the lives of so many others, especially the children, who live with the serious complications from diabetes. We will honor Mary by continuing the work to which she committed so much of her time and energy.

Those of us old enough to remember each have our own recollections of where we were and what we were doing as the horrifying attacks began to unfold.  We share the still-powerful emotions of shock, anger, and grief.  On the evening of that terrible day, members of Congress gathered on the steps of the U.S. Capitol.  With tears in our eyes and sorrow in our hearts, together we sang, “God Bless America.”  The emotions of shock, anger, and grief were joined by unity and resolve.    Today, that moment remains my most enduring memory.  The sense of unity, resolve, and patriotism that swept over us as we sang was a source of strength in the challenges we faced.  In Maine, we remember Robert and Jackie Norton of Lubec, a devoted retired couple who boarded Flight 11 to celebrate a son’s wedding on the West Coast.  We remember James Roux of Portland, an Army veteran and a devoted father, on Flight 175 for a business meeting in California.  We remember Robert Schlegel of Gray who was celebrating his recent promotion to the rank of Commander in the United States Navy, and still settling into his new office at the Pentagon, an office that is believed to be the point of impact for Flight 77.  We remember Stephen Ward of Gorham, who was working on the 101st floor of the North Tower that terrible morning.  On this solemn anniversary, we join all Americans in remembering each of the nearly 3,000 lives lost that day – lives of accomplishment, contribution, and promise.  Each loss leaves a wound in the hearts of families and friends that can never be fully healed.  And we honor the heroes of that day.  We still are moved by the selfless courage of men and women on Flight 93 who wrestled that plane to the ground, sacrificing their lives so that others might live.  We are inspired by the firefighters and police officers at the World Trade Center who continued to climb upward in rescue even as the Twin Towers were coming down.  We pay tribute to the first responders, the military personnel, and the civilians who rushed into the smoke and flames at the Pentagon to lead others to safety.  We express our gratitude to those who have given so much to defend our nation against terrorism, the men and women of our armed forces.    September 11th was not just a day of personal tragedy.  It was an attack on the United States, an attack on freedom, an attack on civilization.  We must never forget what was lost and what remains at stake.  We must pledge to do all that we can to prevent future attacks.  The fundamental obligation of government is to protect its people.  Since September 11th, we have done much to meet that obligation.  In what seemed like a moment, September 11th was transformed from a day like any other into one that, forever, will stand alone.  The loss we relive reminds us of the value of all that we must protect.  The heroism reminds us of the unconquerable spirit of the American people.  Our accomplishments remind us that we can meet any challenge with decisive action.  As long as we keep the meaning of this day of remembrance in our hearts, we will meet the challenges that lie ahead.","status",NA,NA,272,55,26,58,1,0,48,0

On this sacred day, we honor those who paid the ultimate price, whether they lie at rest in foreign lands or in their hometowns.  We honor those who lived beyond their years of military service but who have since passed on.  We honor those who remain missing and pledge that they never will be forgotten.  And we honor those veterans who are with us today.  We owe them all a great debt.  It is estimated that some 48 million Americans have served in uniform since the founding of our nation.  Today, more than 20 million veterans live among us, including more than 116,000 right here in Maine.  To put that in perspective, Maine has more veterans per capita than all but two of the other states in the country.  We are proud of our State’s contributions to protecting our nation.  My father, Don Collins, is a World War II veteran who was wounded twice during the Battle of the Bulge in Europe. He earned two Purple Hearts and the Bronze Star.  It was from him that I first learned to honor and respect our veterans.  We owe our veterans so much, and repay that debt in part, but only in part, with the gratitude we express on Veterans Day.  As a nation, we must also repay our debt with the health care, rehabilitation services, and educational and employment opportunities our veterans have earned through their service to our country.
