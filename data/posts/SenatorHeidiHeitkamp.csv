After the congressional committees do their investigations, if it is determined more issues need to be looked into, then our legislation supporting an independent commission could be a next step. The American people deserve answers so they can judge Russia’s interference for themselves, and thorough investigations are the best way to get those answers. http://bit.ly/2lQDPN2","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorHeidiHeitkamp/photos/a.508988599124511.113972.501810613175643/1337702839586412/?type=3",NA,731,109,106,40,5,0,1,8

After evaluating former Texas Governor Rick Perry to lead the Energy Department, Congressman Ryan Zinke of Montana to lead the Interior Department, and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA through meetings, reviewing their records, and at their respective U.S. Senate committee hearings, I determined that each of them would be open to working on issues important to North Dakota in a pragmatic and fair way. Once confirmed, I’ll hold them accountable to make sure they carry out each agency’s mission in a way that does actually work for North Dakota—and that continues to protect our air and water, tribal lands and sovereignty, and all forms of energy.   Once Mr. Pruitt is confirmed to lead EPA, I’ll work to make sure EPA focuses on smart regulation and works with states and local communities to address issues like the unworkable Waters of the U.S. rule and the punitive final Clean Power Plan rules. Though I have concerns about his commitment to a comprehensive energy strategy that includes renewables and his commitment to reduce emissions to protect our air and water, I’ll work to hold Pruitt accountable and make sure North Dakota’s interests are heard—just as I held the previous EPA administrator accountable. I’ll also push Pruitt to meet statutory requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard, which I pressed him on during a meeting last month given how important a robust RFS is for North Dakota farmers and biofuels workers. At the Department of Energy, I’ll work with Mr. Perry to advance an all-of-the-above energy strategy with a focus on building a viable future for coal through increased investment and emphasis on clean coal technology. Mr. Zinke already has an understanding of federal and tribal land issues having represented Montana, and I’ll work with him to streamline oil and gas permitting on federal lands, increase energy development opportunities in Indian Country, and to maintain good relationships with tribes, which is crucial for Interior.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorHeidiHeitkamp/photos/a.508988599124511.113972.501810613175643/1338546779502018/?type=3",NA,34,162,8,0,0,1,12,55

Our country works best when we work together on real results for the American people. It’s past time to put politics aside and work on policy. It was an aspirational speech and there were a lot of ideas in it, but the devil is in the details. The president will now need to flesh out how his policies will actually work and provide specifics about how to accomplish them. It was encouraging to see Republicans stand up for proposals that they haven’t traditionally been supportive of, including paid family leave – which I have a bill on – and an infrastructure package – which we recently introduced that will support the whole country including rural America. I expressed concerns when our previous president didn’t talk about rural America, and I had the same concerns with this speech.

Johnny told us about his brother, Kenny, who is 65 years old and from Centertown, KY. Kenny worked in the mines for 15 years before he fell down a slope in a mine and hurt his back. He has since been on disability. Kenny now also has serious heart problems and had a heart pump put in several years ago until he gets a heart transplant. But years later, he’s still waiting for that heart transplant. He has now had four heart pumps, including one that got infected. Kenny has been in the hospital for 250 days in the past year and had three major surgeries. Without a fix to the pensions and health care for UMWA workers, Kenny’s health insurance will go away in April. Without health insurance, he would not still be with us today. But what happens to him in April?  When miners like Kenny took these labor intensive jobs that keep all of our lights on, they were promised health care to support themselves and pensions to support their families in the long-term. Except, suddenly everything changed for them. Their pensions and health care have been ripped out from under them even though coal companies committed this money to the UMWA and its workers during bankruptcy proceedings. At the very end of last year, Congress funded a temporary extension of miners’ health benefits, but it expires in April. If Congress doesn’t act, the health care and pensions for thousands of UMWA miners, including many in Kentucky and West Virginia, will go away in April. Congress must pass the Miners Protection Act to give these miners the support they earned and deserve.  When I think of these miners, I also think of the thousands of workers and retirees across the country – including 2,000 families in North Dakota and 400,000 retirees – who could have their health care and pensions ripped away from the Central States Pension Fund. I’ve been to the Teamsters union halls in North Dakota. I’ve heard the stories of these workers and retirees. I’ve seen their tears and pain.

The president's proposed budget would seriously hurt North Dakota and rural America. The budget would slash $4.7 billion from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s budget, and reduce staffing at USDA field offices that North Dakota farmers and ranchers rely on. It entirely cuts rural development programs that guarantee clean water for families and businesses in North Dakota—programs that provided our state with $37 million in federal funding in the last two years alone. It would eliminate a program that provided $22 million just last year to help low-income North Dakota families, seniors, and folks in Indian Country heat their homes this winter. By cutting $1 billion in funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, this budget would jeopardize flood protections in North Dakota that are critical to keeping our communities strong and safe. The budget would also end a federal program that guarantees affordable air travel in rural communities, which helped Devils Lake’s airport board a record-breaking 6,290 passengers last year. Each year, that program invests $4.2 million in Dickinson’s airport, $4 million in Devils Lake’s, and $2.8 million in Jamestown’s, helping keep rural economies vibrant and connected.   This budget is a blueprint of the administration’s priorities, but it unfortunately leaves behind North Dakota and rural communities across this country. Ultimately, it's Congress’ job to set spending priorities and fund the government—and I’ll fight to make sure an even-handed approach wins out, so programs North Dakota businesses and families rely on don’t face senseless cuts.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorHeidiHeitkamp/photos/a.508988599124511.113972.501810613175643/1364154556941240/?type=3",NA,159,47,69,3,2,1,15,9

After doing my due diligence by meeting with Judge Gorsuch and reviewing his record and testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I’ve decided to vote in favor of his confirmation. He has a record as a balanced, meticulous, and well respected jurist who understands the rule of law. He has unique and critical experience with tribal sovereignty, Indian law, and public lands issues in the west, and has received the endorsement of numerous tribes and major Native American organizations. During our meeting and at his hearing, he reinforced the importance of a judiciary that remains independent of the executive and legislative branches of government – and that acts as a proper check and balance on the other two branches of government. I expect him to follow through on that critical tenet.  This vote does not diminish how disturbed I am by what Republicans did to Judge Garland. Senate Republicans played politics at its worst with an honorable, deeply qualified jurist – arguably the most well qualified nominee in modern history – who had long been supported by Republican and Democratic senators for his unmatched experience. His reward: Republicans refused to give him the fair consideration he deserved – not even a hearing – and his nomination was held open for almost 300 days – by far the longest for a Supreme Court nomination. But I was taught that two wrongs don’t make a right. There isn’t a perfect judge.

The budget would eliminate Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), LIHEAP, Essential Air Service (EAS), and the Economic Development Administration (EDA) – all of which are critical in supporting our families, neighbors, and communities. In 2016, nearly $5 million in federal funding from CDBG was used in cities across the state to support low-income families and seniors, combat homelessness, and so much more. LIHEAP provides heating assistance to low-income households and supported 13,000 North Dakotans by helping them heat their homes during our harsh winter. EAS has been critical to reviving air travel in Dickinson, Devils Lake, and Jamestown – helping spur economic growth in each region. And since 2009, the EDA has invested $34 million in North Dakota which has led to $478 million in private investments. These cuts are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the programs that the president’s budget would eliminate or severely reduce, and we need to fight to make sure these cuts don’t go into effect.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorHeidiHeitkamp/videos/1386250448064984/",NA,111,59,34,10,0,0,2,14

But ripping away families’ health care, as the Republican bill would do, isn’t the answer. Rather, it’s a recipe for disaster. This bill would make health care less accessible and less affordable for too many. It’s well past time to stop politics and do policy. That’s what I’ve been trying to accomplish because no family should have to choose between getting critical care for a loved one or facing bankruptcy.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorHeidiHeitkamp/photos/a.508988599124511.113972.501810613175643/1415018861854809/?type=3",NA,484,144,236,27,1,1,21,90

It would also make coverage unaffordable for the more than 300,000 North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions like asthma, cancer, or being pregnant. And it would disproportionately hurt those in rural communities like families all across North Dakota who rely on rural health clinics and rural hospitals for coverage. The biggest savings in the bill would come from about $830 billion in cuts to Medicaid -- a lifesaving, cost effective program that has enabled more than 90,000 seniors, individuals and children with disabilities, and low-income families in North Dakota get affordable, quality care. It is also is a critical resource for individuals receiving treatment for opioid abuse and addiction which has reached epidemic levels in our state. But here’s the kicker: the bill would do all of this while giving individuals making more than $200,000 a tax cut. That isn’t right. In fact, it’s downright mean. Those who voted for this bill should know better – it was a vote for their own self-interest, and certainly not one that stands up for the people of our country or North Dakota.   I’ve long said there are good pieces of the health reform law and pieces that need to be fixed, and that’s a conversation I have wanted to have for years. In 2013, I convened the initial meeting with my health care advisory board made up of health care leaders from across the state and we have continued to meet to talk about how to improve the health reform law. Over the past three and a half years, I’ve offered a variety of reforms to make sure the health reform law works better for families and businesses. Republicans and Democrats need to have this critical conversation, and I’m willing to work with anyone to do what is best for my state. But this bill, which is terrible for North Dakota, is a non-starter.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorHeidiHeitkamp/photos/a.508988599124511.113972.501810613175643/1431706896852672/?type=3",NA,53,46,31,1,0,10,6,39

The report specifically said individuals and children with pre-existing conditions – like Denise Sandvick from Killdeer, North Dakota – would face exorbitant costs for coverage, which could make it unaffordable for them to receive lifesaving care. Denise is one of the more than 300,000 of North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions who would be hurt by this bill.  After losing both her father and brother to heart disease, unfortunately Denise also experienced her own heart complications and is now diagnosed with heart disease. We can’t pull the rug out from under folks, like Denise, who need quality and affordable health care to manage their conditions and stay alive.

The United States can’t remain an energy leader if we aren’t even at the negotiating table. No agreement is perfect, and adjusting our commitments or timetable would have been viable avenues to pursue. But abandoning this agreement altogether is a reckless decision that forfeits an opportunity to guarantee a viable future for North Dakota coal, oil, and natural gas on the global level. We have to acknowledge the reality that all countries—the United States included—must work to reduce emissions, and we can do it in a way that maintains a strong future for fossil fuels and renewables by working with other countries to accomplish those goals. Yet, with this move, the United States is ceding its leadership role to China. Without a strong U.S. voice pushing to invest in carbon capture technologies, as I’ve been fighting for, it’s also less likely that coal will remain a viable part of our energy mix in a carbon-constrained world. Additionally, leaving the deal signals that this administration isn’t serious about wind and other North Dakota renewable resources, which businesses and homeowners are demanding more and more. And it shows a lack of commitment to a true all-of-the-above energy strategy, investment in U.S. companies, and good American jobs across all energy sectors. This agreement isn’t a partisan issue. Utilities, energy companies, former diplomats, and more have urged the U.S. to remain in the deal.   Diplomatically, the United States is retreating. More than 190 countries signed this agreement, and just two opposed it—one of which is Syria. For generations, our country has been a global leader, dictating the conversation around the world on a host of issues.

When Allison was almost two years old, she was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder. Allison’s mother, Jennifer, and father were told that Allison would become severely mentally delayed by age three, and that she would likely pass away by the time she turned 10 years old. Today, Allison is 16 years old thanks to an amazing new, but very expensive therapy that has slowed the progression of her disorder. But Allison’s disorder is progressive and regenerative, so if she isn’t as mobile as possible, she regresses quicker. That means that Allison needs to do a minimum of one physical therapy session per week -- but really, she needs to do much more than that. Allison’s primary insurance covers only 12 physical therapy visits per year, but due to the support provided by Medicaid, Allison is able to get regular physical therapy sessions – including from her school -- without bankrupting her family. Medicaid has been a lifeline for Allison.  But unfortunately for Jennifer and Allison, I can’t tell them if the Republican health care bill being discussed in the U.S. Senate will affect them and their access to Medicaid.

Jennifer Restemayer and her daughter Allison from West Fargo are two of the many North Dakotans that I’ve heard from who are worried about the Republican health care bill would impact them.   When Allison was almost two years old, she was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder. Allison’s parents were told she would become severely mentally delayed by age three, and that she would likely pass away by 10 years old. Over the past several years, Allison has been able to get a new – very expensive -- therapy that has helped slow the progression of her disorder. Because there are currently no longer lifetime limits on coverage, Allison’s family has been able to afford this treatment. Today, Allison is 16 years old.   The Republican health care bill would put in place lifetime maximums, could make it harder or unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions get health insurance, and cut Medicaid – all of which would unfairly impact the Restemayers.   Just as the House bill was crafted and pushed through behind closed doors, we’re now seeing the same thing happening in the U.S. Senate. Just 13 senators are drafting a bill to revamp the health care system, but they won’t allow other senators or the public to see it. They won’t even hold hearings on it.

After drafting a bill in secret to overhaul our country’s health care system, the best Senate Republicans could come up with is a bill that looks very similar to the cruel bill the U.S. House of Representatives passed. Both bills are downright bad for North Dakota. Over the past several decades and in the last few months, I’ve spoken with far too many parents of children with disabilities, individuals with health challenges like cancer or diabetes, and North Dakotans including the elderly and single parents who struggle every day to get the affordable care they deserve. It’s because of them that I refuse to give any credence to bills that would purposely seek to take their health coverage away or make it unaffordable. That isn’t who we are as a country. And it isn’t who I am as a North Dakotan.  Just like the House bill, the Senate bill would put at risk the more than 90,000 North Dakotans on Medicaid – individuals and children with disabilities, seniors, and low-income families – by ending Medicaid expansion and slashing traditional Medicaid – a proven, cost effective, life-saving program – even more than the House bill would. It would still disproportionately hurt rural communities and close rural hospitals and clinics across our state. It would still prevent many North Dakotans from affording treatment for opioid abuse. It would still allow insurance companies to give older, sicker individuals plans with minimal coverage, effectively forcing them to pay out of pocket for their health care which many can’t afford. And it would still do all of this damage while giving a tax cut to the wealthiest Americans.   We need to improve our health care system. I’ve been saying this for years. In 2013, I put together a health care advisory board made up of health care leaders in North Dakota to have that discussion. Over the past three and a half years, I’ve offered many improvements to make the health reform law work better for families and businesses. We should work together and have this important conversation in a bipartisan way, out in the open for all to see and hear.

She has days when she feels good, and days when she doesn’t. Yesterday was one of the days she didn’t. But regardless, she was in Washington, DC on Capitol Hill to advocate against the Senate Republican health care bill because it was too important to be here and have her voice heard. Despite receiving regular treatments since 2009, Ranae – a mother of three – is still working and receives health care through her employer. But she knows that she won’t be able to work forever, and that’s when her fear sets in about the Republican health care proposals. Ranae is worried that she won’t be able to get health insurance because of her pre-existing condition – or that without access to Medicaid or subsides in the exchange, she’ll be charged so much that she and her family won’t be able to afford it. When Ranae was diagnosed in 2009, her youngest son was in kindergarten and her goal was to see him graduate from high school – which happens to be this year. As Ranae says, health care shouldn’t be a partisan issue, it’s a people issue, and it’s a basic needs issue. The Senate Republicans delaying the vote on their health care bill this week is good news, but our fight to make sure we don’t pull the rug out from under folks like Ranae is far from over.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorHeidiHeitkamp/videos/1463945090295519/",NA,111,21,69,20,0,2,17,0

The fight continues to make sure we stop this bill and hearing about the potential impacts from folks across the state and hearing from folks like Matthew and Jenny make me eager to get back to Washington and make sure their voice is heard.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorHeidiHeitkamp/videos/1473719769318051/",NA,136,26,79,17,0,2,18,1

In addition, the Senate Committee on Appropriations approved my request to expand disaster cost reimbursements for farmers and ranchers. And just today after my push, USDA announced that it will provide more staff to the FSA offices in McHenry, Mountrail, Bowman, Golden Valley, Hettinger, and Stark counties – these folks should be deployed in the next week. I consistently hear high praises from farmers in ranchers about the FSA staff that helps them consider their options, but in this severe drought, too many North Dakota offices are understaffed, or have their hands tied in terms of the help they’re able to offer. Secretary Perdue’s quick actions to help get farmers and ranchers assistance reinforce why he is the right person for the job, and I look forward to continuing to work with him to make more comprehensive, permanent improvements to the drought resources our farmers need now.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorHeidiHeitkamp/photos/a.508988599124511.113972.501810613175643/1487222314634463/?type=3",NA,37,12,6,1,0,0,0,0

Trade is essential for agriculture states like North Dakota. If farm workers can’t export their products, their farms and businesses aren’t able to function and their jobs disappear. Farm communities are already struggling with low commodity prices and drought, and on top of that, many have already lost business because of rising tensions with top trading partners. The federal government needs to step in to support our farmers and ranchers, not pull the rug out from under them. I’ve stressed this over and over to USDA Secretary Perdue and U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer to reinforce the concerns of North Dakota farmers and ranchers. We need to and can support American workers and level the playing field for manufacturing jobs, but it must not come at the expense of farm jobs.

Despite being hurt and panicked, they offered protection, support, and put their lives on the line to fulfil their duty. And in the months that followed, these folks continued to risk their lives searching for survivors at a severely hazardous site. These are real American heroes. But for many of the first responders who went to Ground Zero, their selfless work left them with debilitating disease and cancers. Folks like Raymond Pfeifer, who died from cancer that he got after months of searching for survivors in the rubble, and who I was honored to meet. In 2015, Congress finally passed a law that extended health care benefits to survivors and first responders from that day.

As North Dakota’s former tax commissioner, I understand how much these issues directly impact North Dakota families, farmers, and workers – which is why any tax reform plan must be done with their best interest in mind. We still need to see more details about what this tax reform plan entails, and I look forward to reviewing them. It’s encouraging that this meeting included Republican and Democratic senators, as I’ve long said I want to work with those on both sides of the aisle on a comprehensive, permanent tax reform plan that works for North Dakota workers and retirees and helps grow the economy, and I hope these bipartisan discussions continue.","status",NA,NA,428,78,11,17,3,0,0,4

But over the past several years, some members of Congress have stalled the bank from operating or fully functioning for political reasons and hurt American workers and businesses. Today at a U.S. Senate Committee hearing, I asked the president’s nominee to lead the bank, Scott Garrett, for an apology to the American small businesses and workers he hurt by his staunch, political opposition to the Export-Import Bank. But he refused the chance to reconcile his past, or to prove he wouldn’t act as a saboteur of the Bank.

Tax issues are important and complicated, and that’s why Congress needed to work together, Republicans and Democrats, on tax reform. After holding listening sessions across North Dakota, having many discussions about tax reform with top White House officials including the president, and trying to change this bill so it supports working families, it’s discouraging that Senate Republicans weren’t willing to work with us on it. Instead, this bill was crafted at the last minute behind closed doors. And it shows – this bill is bad for North Dakota.  With this legislation, Congress is handing our children a credit card bill with nearly $1.5 trillion of debt – and that’s in the best-case scenario. We need to have an honest conversation about what that means for us long-term. Now, we won’t be able to spend that money on finding a cure for Alzheimer’s and cancer, addressing the opioid epidemic, fixing the country’s pension crisis, boosting national security, rebuilding degraded infrastructure, supporting agriculture research, or providing disaster assistance. All that money will have been spent on tax reform.  Additionally, this bill tries to buy off middle income families for almost nothing, while the wealthy get richer at their expense. In North Dakota, the top one percent – those making over $604,800 – will see an average tax cut of $46,870. The president and most members of Congress will benefit from this bill. Meanwhile, North Dakotans making under $75,220 – 60 percent of those in our state -- will get an average tax cut of just a few hundred dollars. Look at that disparity – there’s nothing fair about it. On the other hand, if these tax cuts were given out evenly across the board rather than disproportionately to the wealthy, every American would get a $9,000 tax cut, but that isn’t what is happening.  I wanted to be able to support a responsible, permanent tax reform bill that stands up for workers, families, and retirees while staying fiscally responsible. I wanted to help write it. But this bill gives large corporations a permanent tax cut, while the tax cuts for working families expire in a few years. It could hurt North Dakota seniors by cutting $400 billion from Medicare. It puts farm programs and the Farm Bill at risk. It makes it more difficult for young families to buy homes. It will be harder for students to afford a college education. It makes it more complicated for small businesses to file taxes. It will take health care away from 13 million families. Teachers won’t be able to buy the school supplies they need. Nonprofit organizations will receive fewer donations to operate and help struggling families. The bill could force cuts for federal oil, gas, and coal payments to North Dakota by $40 million per year. And all the top academics – Republicans and Democrats – say it won’t grow the economy or create jobs in the way Republicans say it will.  It’s up to Congress to set a responsible path forward for our country. This bill is bad business and it’s about a political win, but the detrimental impacts of it will be felt across North Dakota and the country. Every day when I come to work in the U.S. Senate, I’m fighting for families across rural America – the workers, parents, retirees, and children -- who are counting on us to stand up for them and do the right thing for them. But under this bill, they will lose, and that’s why I can’t vote for it.","status",NA,NA,673,327,224,15,10,4,101,91

In fact, I’ve been almost begging Republicans to work with me on a bipartisan bill that could serve North Dakota. I held meetings in North Dakota on tax reform, and met with top White House officials, including the president, on the issue. Unfortunately, I never got a seat at the table, nor did many others. As a result, it produced a partisan tax bill that hurts North Dakota and is full of broken promises to the American people.    We were promised middle income tax cuts without cuts for the wealthy. But this bill gives huge, permanent tax cuts to corporations and millionaires while middle income families will see relatively modest cuts in the short-term and their costs go up in the long run.   We were promised a fiscally responsible bill. But this bill charges nearly $1.5 trillion on a credit card account to our children and grandchildren without a plan to pay for it.   We were promised a simpler tax code so we could file taxes on a postcard. But this bill makes the tax code even more confusing and more difficult for families to understand their tax liability.   We were promised no loopholes. But this bill is full of loopholes for real estate moguls, private jet companies, and others, enabling large corporations and the wealthy to pay lower taxes.   And we were promised a bill that would grow the economy. But experts and academics agree this bill won’t boost the economy the way Republicans say it will, and many executives have said they will use corporate tax cuts to pad their shareholders’ profits, not create jobs or boost wages.   Congress can’t build a successful bill if it is quickly crafted behind closed doors without input from both parties. I know that because I’ve crafted many bipartisan bills that serve North Dakota including lifting the ban on exporting oil, finding a viable path forward for coal, and giving community banks and credit unions relief. Those bills didn’t happen overnight – they took good faith negotiations, compromises from all sides, and a mutual effort to work across the aisle. That didn’t happen with this tax bill. And it shows. Every day, I come to work in the U.S. Senate to fight for North Dakota and rural America.

Local organizations that serve these victims and their families say that emergency shelter requests have increased, while funding for these critical services has decreased or been diverted to other programs. Last week, I helped introduced a bipartisan bill to address this problem by leveling the playing field for transitional housing and encouraging HUD to find living options that best support survivors, so that they can receive the housing, safety, and trauma support they need to begin the healing and recovery process. Watch this WDAZ story to learn more about how my bill would help provide urgently needed shelter.","link","http://www.wdaz.com/news/government-and-politics/4376825-sen-heitkamp-introduces-bill-help-shelter-victims-domestic","wdaz.com",57,19,5,2,1,1,4,1

But lurching from deadline to deadline is no way to govern, and it’s unfortunate that Congress is once again kicking the can down the road for another few weeks. North Dakota families and small businesses understand the importance of budgeting and planning for their year ahead because they need to make sure they can put food on the table and support their kids, so there’s no excuse for Congress’s failure to do the same.   I’m disappointed that the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) was only extended for three months. That’s little consolation to families with sick children who rely on the program for their health care needs. This program is about life and death, and the families who rely on it need long-term certainty to know that their kids will be protected.  This bill waived the PAYGO law, meaning that vital programs like Medicare and agricultural assistance are not cut. Avoiding cuts is good, but it means Congress is still adding a $1.5 trillion tax bill to our nation’s credit card, to be paid for by our children and grandchildren. And experts and academics have said the Republican tax bill won’t pay for itself. Unfortunately, the options aren’t good – either cut critical programs families rely on or push huge costs onto future generations. North Dakotans expect and deserve more fiscal responsibility than that. Since before joining the U.S. Senate, I’ve called for Congress to pass a balanced budget amendment, and I cosponsored a bill to do just that because the federal government needs to gets its fiscal house in order.  While Congress avoided a government shutdown, which would be damaging to our economy and disruptive to many North Dakotans, it must end this cycle of short-term spending bills that just kick the can down the road, and instead give our economy the certainty it needs to grow.","status",NA,NA,167,68,10,8,4,2,15,4
