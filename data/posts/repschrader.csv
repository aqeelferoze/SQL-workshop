It is currently, and rightfully, illegal for a mortgage loan lender to foreclose on an active duty servicemember. You may have read recently about Jacob McGreevey, a veteran from Vancouver, who’s home was illegally foreclosed on in 2012 while he was serving his third of four tours of duty. Jacob didn’t know his rights at the time and by the time he learned about protections that made the foreclosure illegal, a court ruled against him, claiming too much time had passed. My HOMES Act is a simple, no-brainer bill to protect our fighting men and women, like Jacob, from exploitation by unscrupulous mortgage loan lenders.

As a small business owner, I believe DC should be in the business of producing outcomes rather than micromanaging with bureaucratic rules and regulations. But Dodd-Frank is a good piece of legislation that’s been necessary in preventing another financial catastrophe like the one we saw in 2008. Millions lost their homes and jobs while retirement savings evaporated into nothingness. Dodd-Frank ensured that banks would be less likely to go broke, less likely to need bailing out, and less likely to wreak havoc on our global economy. The so-called CHOICE Act that I voted against today will not only allow the big banks to go back to mixing your deposits with their risky investments, but it also weakens capital requirements, making those big banks vulnerable again. Not to mention, the bill goes too far in loosening credit requirements and increases the likelihood of risky derivative investments, putting us exactly back to where we were prior to the Great Recession. Our focus should be on easing up government bureaucracy on our community banks and credit unions who were never part of the problem. This financially irresponsible bill does none of that.","status",NA,NA,136,24,12,0,1,9,14,6

We released our plan this morning. The Affordable Care Act has helped 20 million Americans access quality health care. Medicaid expansion has been an unqualified success in both red and blue states. Let's get one thing clear: repeal is not a solution. But we have to face facts. Some folks in the individual marketplace have seen their premiums and deductibles increase significantly due to an imbalance in the marketplace and uncertainty caused by this new administration. Let’s fix that! Our five-point proposal aims squarely at stabilizing and improving the individual market. We’ve talked with health care experts, providers, and patients to find real solutions.

This year will mark the second year I have organized a Service Academy Information Day in hopes of providing motivated high school students from Oregon’s Fifth Congressional District an opportunity to learn about our nations' service academies.
