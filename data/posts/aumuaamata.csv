I’m looking forward to the start of the New Year, and the 115th Congress!

I am encouraged that the first bills my colleagues in the House chose to address this Congress are these two Veterans’ bills, which will help improve the care our veterans receive, as well as provide accountability in the VA; when these bills were introduced in the 114th Congress, I was proud to support them out of committee. I want to thank our new Chairman, Phil Roe (TN) and my colleagues on the VA committee for all their work on these bills and for their dedication to our nation’s veterans.  The House passed the following bills:  The Biological Implant Tracking and Veterans Safety Act directs the VA secretary to adopt the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) unique device identification system (UDI) for labeling of all biological implants and to implement an automated inventory system to ensure veterans do not receive expired or otherwise contaminated tissue. In January 2014, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that the VA does not use a standardized process for tracking biological tissue from cadaver donor to living veteran recipient. In the event of a recall, it would often be impossible to track down which patient received contaminated tissue. The same GAO report detailed the Veterans Health Administration’s failure to consistently ensure they are purchasing tissue from biological implant vendors that have registered with the FDA.   The Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act, introduced by Rep. Ryan Costello (R-PA), would require all reprimands and admonishments given to VA employees to remain in their file as long as they are employed by the Department. Under current policy, an admonishment and reprimand can only stay on an employee’s record for two and three years, respectively.  I look forward to working with the new administration and my colleagues on the Veterans Affairs Committee to ensure that our veterans’ in the territories, states, and particularly American Samoa receive the care and benefits that they have earned.","status",NA,NA,16,2,1,3,0,0,0,0

While this is just a small improvement to how the Members from the territories are able to participate in House business, it demonstrates the Republican majority’s willingness to extend our hand across the aisle and be more inclusive of the territories, who have traditionally been boxed out regardless of the party in the majority.  This has been one of my top priorities since first being elected in 2014.  The Committee of the Whole, abbreviated for Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, is a parliamentary device in which the entire House of Representatives are considered one congressional committee. The presiding officer (Chairman) is chosen by the Speaker of the House and is usually reserved for a member of the majority party who does not hold the chair of a standing committee.  Any victory for the territories we can get is welcomed, and this small yet significant increase in our level of participation in House business will help us continue to bridge that gap as we move forward.

The TPP was signed by President Obama last February, but had not yet been ratified by Congress.  “It’s only the first full work day for the President, and he is already bringing positive change to the nation.  As you know, the TPP would have placed the tuna canning industry in American Samoa at great risk by allowing those countries like Thailand, where they pay their workers a fraction of what ours make to have the same access to markets in the United States without any of the fees associated with it.  The fact that our canneries are American companies, allows them free access to the markets here.  The TPP would have completely erased this small but significant benefit, which allows our canneries to compete with those companies whose wages border on the equivalent of servitude.  Getting the United States out of the TPP has been one of the cornerstones of my policy to keep our canneries competitive, and I could not be happier to know that the TPP will no longer be of concern thanks to President Trump’s action today.  I will continue to push for polices and legislation that allows our local industry to thrive, such as returning the ability to set local wages back to the local government.  Not only does the President’s decision make sense economically, but also morally, and I want to thank him for keeping his word, and withdrawing the United States from what would have been an economic disaster especially here in American Samoa.  I also want to applaud his standing up for the rights of our working men and women who do such a great job.  I look forward to working with the new administration to help grow the economies of the Pacific territories and insular areas, and bring about real opportunity for the people of American Samoa.  It’s a new day, and this is the first of many positive changes to come.”","status",NA,NA,622,90,358,137,0,7,0,2

Here is my entire press release:  Washington, D.C. –Tuesday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata, and the House of Representatives addressed H.R. 276 this afternoon.  The bill amends title 49, United States Code, to ensure reliable air service in American Samoa.   “I could not be happier to report that the House passed our important legislation this afternoon, that will make the permitting process easier for those foreign air carriers who provide service in American Samoa between the islands of Tutuila and Manu'a,” stated Amata.  “Traditionally, these carriers have had to reapply for the permits every 30 days, which in turn has discouraged other carriers from providing service on the route.  I am hopeful that by easing these burdensome regulations more carriers will begin to service the route, thereby increasing competition and reducing the cost of travel for our people between the islands,” continued Amata.  Specifically, H.R. 276 changes the requirement of foreign carriers who service the route between Tutuila and Manu’a to apply for a waiver from every 30 days, to every six months.  Congresswoman Amata’s measure passed the House by unanimous consent and will now be sent to the Senate for consideration where it is expected to easily pass and will then be sent to the President for his signature.  “This is just the first step in improving the air service in American Samoa, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Washington, as well as our local leadership here at home to make those much needed improvements a reality,” said Amata.  “I want to thank Chairman Shuster, Subcommittee Chairman LoBiondo, and their staff for their efforts in getting this bill that is so important to the people of American Samoa quickly through the committee.

The purpose of the hearing was to examine hurdles facing small businesses in providing health care for their employees.  “Whatever happens with health care reform in the near future, the territories cannot be left out of the discussion.  It is reprehensible that when the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2009 the territories weren’t taken into account at all,” stated Amata.  “When it comes to the health care choices our small businesses are able to provide to their employees, the issue becomes even more significant for my home district of American Samoa, where nearly all of  the businesses qualify as a small business,” continued Amata, who is the Chairman of the Small Business Subcommittee on Health and Technology.  Specifically, the purpose of the hearing was to examine the current health insurance marketplace for small firms, review recent difficulties, and explore options to improve access, affordability, and consistency in America’s health insurance market.  Improving American’s access to quality health insurance at an affordable cost will continue to be a dominant issue throughout the beginning part of the 115th Congress.

Currently, those veterans who need to receive VA medical treatment must fly to Hawaii to see their Doctor…which the VA foots the bill for, as well as their lodging costs for the week due to the limited number of flights a week to American Samoa.  Another reason our veterans must fly to Hawaii to receive VA services is because the only hospital in American Samoa is so run down and lacking in proper equipment and medical professionals, that the VA will not allow anything other than outpatient services for our local veterans to be done at the hospital.” continued the Congresswoman.  The MilCon /VA Appropriations Subcommittee has funding oversight regarding any military construction projects and the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Today’s hearing was to allow Members to voice their desires for the upcoming FY-18 Military Construction / Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill, which serves to fund all VA operations as well as armed forces construction projects.

Yesterday I testified before the  Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, fighting for an increase in funding for the American Samoan Government. Read my press release here:  Washington, D.C. –Tuesday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata, at a House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior fought for and requested a long overdue increase to the funding for American Samoa Government operations; citing the rise in the population, the departure of the cannery and other factors for the increase.  “As it stands, the amount awarded in the first year of record (1974) for this account was $13 million…it is now 43 years later and that amount has increased to only $22 million annually. To give you an idea of just how thin this funding is currently being stretched, ASG operations funded under this program are basic Department of Education (DoE) operations; LBJ Tropical Medical Center operations; American Samoa Community College (ASCC) operations, and High Court operations,” stated Amata.  “If adjusted for inflation from that 1974 figure, the current amount would be $64 million annually.  The good that this increase would do, cannot be overstated and would be utilized to improve the conditions at the only hospital on the island, as well as other much needed improvements to those entities I just listed,” continued the Congresswoman.  The House Interior, Environment & Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee holds a Member’s Day hearing every year, so that they can hear directly from the Members on exactly what their funding priories are for their districts.  It also allows the members to voice any additional concerns they may have with funding levels for the departments under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee.  To emphasize the great gulf in funding for American Samoa to Congresswoman continued testifying, “Also to give you an idea of just how disproportionate the funding is not only between American Samoa and the states, but the other territories as well; just last week the Department of the Interior sent an adjustment to the U.S. Virgin Islands in the amount of $18.2 million for their Rum Excise Taxes for Fiscal Year 2016, bringing their total excise tax revenues to $231.5 Million for the year.  It is of note that the U.S. Virgin Islands population is only double that of American Samoa, yet their excise tax benefits are currently 10 and a half times that of my home district…this adjustment is nearly equal to the full amount of funding American Samoa receives from the ASG operations account.”  In closing, Congresswoman Amata stated, “I want to thank both Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for their time and efforts in getting this critical appropriation measure to the floor and I look forward to continuing to work with them to end the discrepancies in funding between American Samoa and our counterparts.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/photos/a.1538865479736363.1073741828.1537155909907320/1877644219191819/?type=3",NA,40,10,8,5,0,1,0,0

Today my colleagues in the House Veterans Affairs Committee held a joint hearing with our counterparts in the Senate. The topic was Veterans Service Organizations. Read my press release here:  Washington, D.C. –Wednesday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata, and the House Veterans Affairs Committee (HVAC), in conjunction with the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, held a series of joint hearings this week, regarding the budget requests of several major Veterans Service Organizations (VSO’s) including, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), the Disabled Veterans of America (DVA), and the American Legion.  “It is always informative when the various VSO’s conduct their annual budget hearings with Congress,” said Amata.  “It allows us the opportunity to hear directly from our veterans on how we can improve the services and care being delivered to those who have sacrificed so much for our nation.  Post 3391 in my home district of American Samoa plays a central role in our local veteran’s lives. Lead by Post Commander Maria B. Vaa-Igafo, their advocacy is critical to ensuring our veterans are being given the same benefits as their counterparts in the states, so I want to thank them back home in Pago Pago for the work they do,” continued the Congresswoman.  The hearings which took place over a week were all filled to capacity with VSO members and their families in the audience, while National Leadership from each organization presented their statement. During the hearings, the VSO’s presented their budget requests, and spoke on some of the improvements that can be made at the VA, in order to ensure that veterans are receiving the benefits they have earned.  Members from each VSO stated their strong belief that the VA should not be privatized, and each VSO also stated their strong support for increased and improved services for our rural veterans to name just a few of the topics discussed.  “I want to thank our veterans and their organizational leadership for their presentations which do a tremendous amount in helping Congress formulate policies and legislation that better serve them.  It is my goal to make sure that our veterans in American Samoa are afforded the same care and benefits as their counterparts in the states, and I won’t stop until that is a reality.  In fact, following the recent CODEL, I expect some real positive changes for our veterans coming very soon,” concluded Amata.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/photos/a.1538865479736363.1073741828.1537155909907320/1877715185851389/?type=3",NA,25,2,2,3,0,0,0,0

Yesterday, my bill to change the name of the VA clinic in Pago Pago after Faleomavaega Eni was introduced and passed by the House of Representatives. Eni was a dear friend, and I will deeply miss him.  Read my Press Release here:  Washington, D.C. –Tuesday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata, and the House of Representatives passed a bill today, which was introduced by the Congresswoman to honor the former Member of Congress from American Samoa, Faleomavaega Eni, who passed away on February 22nd.  “In honoring Faleomavaega's legacy, given that I challenged him for his seat from 1994 until 2014 - when I won my first term - Eni and I had a long and complicated relationship. Though we were often at odds politically, we always treated one another with the utmost respect and grace, allowing us to form a shared bond that I am very thankful for, and will never forget,” said Amata.  “Ours was a true friendship that demonstrated that despite whatever political differences we may have, we can all come together for the good of those we serve.  While we may have had our disagreements on national issues, we were very much in sync when it came to federal policy and funding for American Samoa,” continued the Congresswoman during the floor time for the bill.  Specifically, the legislation will officially name the Department of Veterans Affairs community based outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa, the Faleomavaega Eni Fa’aua’a Hunkin VA Clinic.  “I want to encourage my colleagues in the House and Senate to salute my predecessor by supporting this measure, so that we may honor this good man for his lifelong service and dedication to the people of American Samoa and to veterans everywhere,” concluded the Congresswoman just prior to the passage of the bill through the House.  The legislation will now be sent to the Senate for consideration, before being sent to the President for his signature.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/photos/a.1538865479736363.1073741828.1537155909907320/1880991962190378/?type=3",NA,316,27,63,143,0,0,0,0

First I testified before the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee about the need for improvements to our local infrastructure. After that the Natural Resources committee held a hearing on infrastructure in Native American and Territorial lands.   Read my PR here:  Washington, D.C. –Thursday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata, took to the witness table twice on Thursday at Member’s day hearings for two separate appropriations subcommittees, who for the last two weeks have been holding Member’s Day hearings, so that House Members may testify before each subcommittee regarding the needs of their districts.  The Congresswoman first addressed the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing & Urban Development (THUD) stating, “As you may know, American Samoa lies in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, south of the equator.  We are the most remote U.S. territory or state and our infrastructure needs reflect that gulf in distance.”  The Congresswoman continued to address American Samoa’s infrastructure needs “American Samoa is also suffering from dangerous roads and other traffic infrastructure safety issues that must be addressed soon.  Because our small islands, which are roughly the same size as Washington, D.C., are hit with extremely powerful typhoons every year, the infrastructure is in constant need of repair.  The lack of sufficient funding in the past has caused many of the much needed repairs to go undone.”  Amata also mentioned the need for an airport tower at Pago Pago Intl Airport, “Currently, any air traffic that flies into or out of American Samoa, or even between the islands in my home district, must do so under the air traffic authority of Independent Samoa, due to the lack of an Air Traffic Control Tower in the territory…This includes the CODEL that was just there two weeks ago.”  The goal of the Congresswoman’s effort is to increase the funding levels for those appropriations accounts that benefit the territories and specifically American Samoa, such as the Territorial Highway Improvements account, which funds all road projects in the territories.  Following her testimony to the THUD subcommittee, the Congresswoman rushed directly to her Natural Resources Committee hearing on infrastructure improvement in Native American and Territorial lands.  She questioned Acting Assistant Secretary Nikolao Pula on how American Samoa can continue to receive Capital Improvement Project funds. The funds are used on various territorial projects, from education to transportation.   “American Samoa in particular is engaged in never-ending fight to make sure that our islands are on equal footing as the states and other territories. The Capital Improvement Project allows us to alleviate some of our funding issues, going no only towards healthcare projects, but also education, transportation, and other infrastructure projects, and I would love to see the grant program not only continue, but possibly be expanded,” stated Aumua Amata in her statement during the hearing.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/photos/a.1538865479736363.1073741828.1537155909907320/1882034568752784/?type=3",NA,37,2,4,6,0,0,0,0

The Congresswoman’s sentiments were echoed by her colleagues on the committee, as well as the majority of the expert panelists who were invited to participate.  “For over a millennium our people have fished these waters.  For some bureaucrat in Washington to make the decision to close off these vast swaths of ocean to our people without even consulting the local leadership or industry, so that they may appease their environmental masters, is unacceptable,” said Amata.  “The environmental colonialists have gone too far in expanding these protected areas, to the severe detriment of American Samoa, and I am glad that my colleagues on the committee have seen the need to address the issue,” continued the Congresswoman.  Most notably, the Remote Pacific Islands Marine Monument, which is part of American Samoa’s traditional fishing grounds, have been expanded and closed completely to U.S. fishing interests, while remaining open to our foreign competitors who fish for these migratory species without the conservation methods and regulations followed by our fishermen.  “I want to thank both Chairman Lamborn and Ranking Member Huffman for allowing me to participate in today’s subcommittee hearing, so that I could explain the importance of access to these waters for our fishing fleet, as well as Mr. Hallman, whose testimony today was very insightful,” concluded Amata.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/photos/a.1538865479736363.1073741828.1537155909907320/1885157351773839/?type=3",NA,35,3,3,2,0,0,0,0

Read my full press release here:  Washington, D.C. –Wednesday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata, and the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Health held a hearing on Capitol Hill this afternoon to examine ways the VA might improve their hiring practices, and retain good employees.  “I want to thank Chairman Wenstrup and my colleagues on the subcommittee for holding today’s hearing which is so important for improving the services for our veterans,” said Amata.  “Veteran’s health concerns are an issue that I hold close to my heart. I represent the territory of American Samoa; and from the Army’s own website, our recruitment depot has the highest recruitment rate out of all 885 recruitment depots. I find it quite distressful then that my constituents, who greatly rely on the services of the Department of Veterans Affairs, often have to travel to Hawai’i for medical care. Now, the onus of the blame cannot solely be placed on the Department of Veterans Affairs; it’s failure of action here in Congress that punishes veterans as well.” concluded Amata. Amata questioned the witnesses on the best way to attract and retain staff in remote and rural areas, such as American Samoa.  Specifically, during this hearing, the Subcommittee discussed actions needed to correct deficiencies within VA’s overly complicated hiring processes that hinder the VA’s ability to efficiently and effectively recruit and retain high-quality employees and evaluate how staffing needs at the local level are identified and communicated.  The Subcommittee also examined the recent media reports alleging that the $2.5 billion dollars that Congress provided to increase hiring of clinical personnel across the VA healthcare system did not result in its intent.  “Following the passage of H.R. 1367 last week, which I was proud to support, my colleagues on the committee and I thought it prudent to further examine this issue that has hampered the VA’s ability to provide quality and timely services to our veterans,” stated Amata.  “As we move forward, we must make sure that the VA has not only the ability to fire underperforming employees, or those guilty of other infractions; but also that they can attract and retain qualified and committed workers to help serve our nation’s heroes,” continued the Congresswoman.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/photos/a.1538865479736363.1073741828.1537155909907320/1888654211424153/?type=3",NA,33,6,3,5,0,0,0,0

The reason reconciliation is being used, is to make it easier to pass in the Senate where it will only require 51 votes instead of the usual 60.  The good news is that there is a three step process and the territories will be considered in step three,” continued the Congresswoman.  In order to secure affordable and quality healthcare for the territories, Congresswoman Amata has introduced legislation to be considered in the third phase of reform which will make long overdue changes to how the territories are funded.  “In short my language would make it so the territories are funded the same as the states when it comes to Medicaid,” stated Amata.  “Although step three will be considered at a later time, I wanted to introduce it now so we can get the discussion started.  To that end, I have already spoken to Speaker Ryan who assures me that my proposal will be taken up in the third phase, and I look forward to working with him and the committee chairmen when that happens.

However, just because they are only found in American Samoa does not mean that they are endangered. The local communities in both the territories and the Native American tribes should be consulted, and given a voice before the Fish and Wildlife Service adds or removes an animal from the endangered species list, so that it does adversely affect the economic or infrastructure development of the United States’ poorest areas.”  Amata asked the panel of witnesses whether the United States had an obligation to consult with either territorial leaders, or tribal leaders when their people would be affected. The hippie said they’ll always support animals over people. The panel, generally agreed that the Endangered Species Act is sometimes at odds with the duties and responsibilities of the United States over the territories and Native American tribes.  Chairman Labrador had the following to say “the testimony we heard today is crystal clear that we need – in an infrastructure package or legislation moving forward – to address ESA for people and species.

While I think we can all agree about the importance of the National Marine Monuments, how they protect our pristine waters and coral reefs, the lack of consultation with the local American Samoan community and the fishing industry at large, has created detrimental effects on our economy. We discussed creating a waiver for US flagged boats that would allow them to fish for tuna; but keep other environmental rules in place.

Faleomavaega VA Clinic.”  Before undertaking the project, Aumua met with Governor Lolo Matalasi Moliga, who along with President of the Senate Gaoteote and Speaker Savali Talavou Ale concurred and expressed their full support for the initiative.  ""I had hoped we would have been able to have a signing ceremony before the memorial service, while Eni's widow Hinanui and their children were in the nation's capital, but that was the week the debate over health care consumed everyone's time, so it was not possible to get it on the President's schedule,” said Amata.

Amata went on to say she ""appreciated the honor of delivering the eulogy” at the Washington, D.C. memorial service, which was held at the Fort Myer Memorial Chapel adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery.

Read my press release here:  Pago Pago – Thursday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata, held several town-hall meetings over the last few days in the Manu’a Islands, to meet with constituents, hear their concerns, and update them on the work being done in Washington on their behalf.  “It is always a pleasure to come to Manu’a…the beauty here is unparalleled anywhere in the world, and I am always excited to meet with our constituents and hear directly from them regarding their concerns or needs, and what I can do to help them through my work in Washington,” stated Amata.  “It is important that all of our people have a chance to voice their thoughts directly to those who represent them, so I make sure that I get out here at least a few times a year, if not more,” continued the Congresswoman.  Amata arrived in Manu’a on Monday, and returns to Tutuila today, where she will hold several more town-hall meetings over the next two weeks.  During the discussions, Amata will be updating those in attendance on the work that she and her staff are doing for the people of American Samoa, including her efforts to get the U.S. territories on the same footing as the states in regards to Medicaid funding.  While the first effort to reform healthcare in the nation was met with resistance, Congress is continuing to negotiate on the issue, and looks to have another attempt at reform sometime in the near future.  “I am determined to make sure that my legislation to put the territories on the same level as the states in regards to Medicaid is included in any reform package,” said Amata.  The Congresswoman will also be addressing her efforts to make sure that the tax credit for U.S. businesses who operate in American Samoa is included in the upcoming tax reform legislation which is currently under negotiation.  “Congress is beginning to address tax reform, and it is essential that American Samoa be given special consideration regarding the tax credit for businesses who want to come here” said Amata.  “Our economic and geographic isolation are greater than that of any other U.S. region...getting this tax credit not only reinstated, but made permanent and expanded is a top priority of mine, and I am confident that we will get it done,” continued Amata.  “I want to encourage all who are able; to join us at the town-hall meetings.  It is so important that I hear from our people, as it allows me to know what is happening here in American Samoa on the grassroots level.  I look forward to seeing everyone over the next few weeks, and am grateful for the opportunity to serve on their behalf,” concluded Amata.","status",NA,NA,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Read my press release here:  Pago Pago, AS –Monday, at the request of Congresswoman Amata, Vice President Pence and the Second Lady stopped in American Samoa Sunday on their way back to Washington, D.C. from the V.P.’s tour of Asia, where he met with strategic partners in the region to bolster economic and military cooperation.  “After the Vice President asked me to be a part of the transition team, which I was honored to serve on, I felt it was an opportune time invite him to visit our beautiful home here in the South Pacific,” said Amata.  “I wanted him to see first-hand, the love our people have for this great nation, as well as help us dedicate the newly named Eni F.H. Faleomavaega Veterans clinic,” continued Amata. The local VA clinic was renamed after legislation introduced by the Congresswoman was signed into law last month by President Trump.  Upon his arrival, Vice President Pence was welcomed by Governor Lolo Moliga and the First Lady, Lt. Governor Lemanu Palepoi Sialega Mauga, the Speaker of the House Savali, Chief Justice Kruse, the Secretary of Samoan Affairs Mauga, Congresswoman Amata and other local dignitaries at Pago Pago Intl Airport.  The Governor then led a traditional welcoming ceremony for the Vice President and his family. The Vice President also helped dedicate the renaming of the local VA clinic to the Eni F.H. Faleomavaega Veterans clinic, during which time he addressed the soldiers from the 100th Infantry Battalion stationed in American Samoa.  Vice President Pence spoke on the challenges the United States faces in the Pacific; and thanked them for their dedicated service.  Vice President Pence is now only the 6th White House dignitary to visit the Territory.  “The Vice President’s trip was a massive success,” stated Amata. “I want to thank Governor Lolo and the Lt. Governor for their hard work in helping us welcome the Vice President and Second Lady to our beautiful home without a hitch…it truly was a historic day for American Samoa,” said the Congresswoman.  “I was honored that he accepted my invitation to visit the territory on his way back to Washington, DC, after his trip to South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, and Australia.  His visit has brought great exposure of American Samoa, and our conversations on Air Force II were very productive and hope inspiring.  The Vice- President and President Trump are demonstrating with their actions that they truly care about the people in the Pacific territories, and I look forward to continuing to work with them to see that our people are given the same opportunities and resources as those in the states,” continued the Congresswoman. “Vice President Pence’s dedication of the Eni F.H. Faleomavaega clinic brought tears to my eyes.

Due to the importance the order has for American Samoa, Amata was in attendance for the historic signing.  “I want to thank the President for his actions today.  While well intended when first signed into law, the Antiquities Act had become a tool for previous administrations to control nonfederal lands and marine resources without input from the local populations,” said Amata.  “These monument designations that have come at the behest of special interest groups, have often been extremely harmful to those who have traditionally utilized them, such as American Samoa.  Among the monuments being considered are marine monuments in the Pacific, including the monument around American Samoa. If legislative action is necessary, I will take whatever action necessary to return our waters which have sustained us long before our relationship with America. Our people have been cut off from access to regions of the Pacific that we have fished for over a millennium.  I look forward to the corresponding actions that will come as a result of this review, and getting our fishermen back on the waters that have sustained us long before any relationship with the United States.” continued Amata.  The review will specifically examine the designations made over the past 20 years, and will seek to rectify the lack of input from local leadership that has plagued the Act for far too long.  Further actions are expected as a result of the review.  “I want to once again thank President Trump for his keen insight in examining this issue that is so important to American Samoa, and I look forward to continuing to work with his administration and correct this long standing issue that has caused so much harm.

Prior to speaking, the Congresswoman was encouraged and inspired by the stories of others that were at the celebration. The speech was broadcast to all FEMA locations across the United States.  “The term Asian-Pacific American encompasses a multitude of different cultures, values, and traditions, and while on the outside that may seem to pose an obstacle to real unification, it is actually a very powerful tool that has the ability to reach much further and have more influence than if we were to all try to achieve our mutual goals separately.  Together, we are 15 million strong!” stated Amata.   “We must put aside any conflicting interests for the greater good of all Asian-Pacific Americans. Embrace Differences- Instead of pointing out what makes us different, let us instead highlight in a positive way what makes each of our cultures unique, and recognize what that may do for the greater good.”  “America is unique in that it is not based on ethnicity.

Here is my statement on the passage of HR 1628 The American Health Care Act by the House of Representatives today:  Washington, DC –Thursday, House Republicans today passed HR1628 The American Health Care Act. This is the first step in the Republican plan to fix the American health care system. The passage of this bill does not affect the health care services in American Samoa.   “I applaud my colleagues in the House for passing The American Health Care Act (AHCA); this is the first step in fixing the flaws of the Affordable Care Act (ACA),” said Amata. “One of the major flaws in the ACA, is that it excludes the U.S. territories altogether,” continued the Congresswoman.   When the AHCA was first brought before the House in March, the Congresswoman introduced an amendment, which was ruled not in order due to H.R. 1628 qualifying as a “reconciliation” bill, meaning that the bill simply has the authority to amend the ACA.  The Congresswoman’s amendment would put the territories on the same footing as the states in regards to Medicaid funding and services.  The next step in the overhaul of the nation’s health care system will be to address the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) reauthorization during which time the Congresswoman will reintroduce her amendment. The SCHIP program provides funds to states and territories for families that have children, but may not qualify for Medicaid.  “Through my discussions with Leadership, I have been assured that when the SCHIP reauthorization comes before the House, the Territories will have a seat at the table. I will continue to do all I can to ensure that my amendment is adopted, and look forward to seeing it included in the final bill language. It is essential that we get the Territories on the same level as the states in regards to the health care choices and services; my amendment would do that,” concluded Amata.","status",NA,NA,21,1,5,1,0,0,0,0

Also, our fishermen are the most responsible and regulated in the world…as it stands currently, these fish swim through the monuments and are then caught by nations with little to no environmental regulations…that is not helping the sustainability for the future” continued Amata.  The executive order to review the monuments which was issued by the President last month will specifically examine the designations made over the past 20 years, and will seek to rectify the lack of input from local leadership that has plagued the Act for far too long.  Further actions are expected as a result of the review.  “Our oceans are the most important biospheres on the planet and are what give us life.

As you may know, access to VA resources and services is an ongoing concern for our veterans,” stated Amata. “LBJ Hospital lacks the services and facilities to treat our veterans, which means that our local veterans must travel thousands of miles to receive even the most basic care. This places not only a high financial cost on the American taxpayer, but also unnecessary stress and hardship on veterans seeking care and their families,” continued the Congresswoman. “Another issue that I would like to see rectified in the near future is that of creating a dignified and hallowed space for our heroes to be laid to rest. I will be working with the VA to finally get a veterans’ cemetery in American Samoa,” stated Amata.  During the meeting, HVAC members held a candid discussion with Secretary Shulkin regarding VA’s priorities for FY 2018. Among the concerns raised by the Congresswoman were the access to healthcare, the lack of a VA cemetery on the island, and other issues facing our veterans in the Pacific.  “I want to thank Secretary Shulkin for inviting us to share breakfast with him, as well as for his responsive attention to our concerns as the VA formulates their new priorities.

This has caused many issues regarding the territory’s ability to attract new investment in the island, and has in fact caused many businesses to leave,” stated Amata.  “While we love this nation, and cherish the relationship we have with the United States, it is extremely irresponsible for the federal government to say that American Samoa should become more self-sustaining, while at the same time forcing burdensome regulations on the territory such as the federal mandate for a minimum wage, and the closing off of large swaths of the ocean which our people have utilized for centuries,” continued the Congresswoman.  Specifically, Congresswoman Amata’s bill would amend the “Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007” to restore the system in place prior to 2007.  Prior to 2007, the minimum wage in American Samoa was set by a Special Industry Committee under the direction of the Department of Labor.  This system allowed American Samoa companies to maintain an equal footing with foreign competition who have no minimum wage at all.  “Ideally, I would like nothing more than for our companies to be able to pay much higher wages to our people, and be able to maintain their ability to operate, but that is just not the case in the real world,” said Aumua.  “Our people know all too well just how precarious our cannery is in regards to competition from nations who have no minimum wage and zero to little regulations on their fishing operations, as we saw one of the two close it operations last year.  We also know just how important the remaining cannery is to our local economy, and my bill will go a very long way in making sure that Starkist continues to call American Samoa home for many years to come,” continued the Congresswoman.  “I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to get this bill through both chambers, and onto the President’s desk as soon as possible.

The roundtable also included discussion of legislation that would help veteran-owned small businesses, including veteran-owned businesses in American Samoa.  “Many of my fellow Committee members, some of whom are veterans themselves, are committed to making sure the law is upheld and the VA is truly putting veterans first,” said House Chairman Steve Chabot.  “I have the honor of sitting on the Veterans Affairs Committee and the Small Business Committee.

For the first time in 30 years American Samoa will receive an increase in operations funding! Read my press release here:  Washington, DC –Wednesday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata praised the work of subcommittee Chairman Ken Calvert, the other members of the subcommittee, and committee staff for their efforts to not only stave off the proposed Administration cuts to ASG funding, but actually increased the funding for the first time since 1986.  “Since my very first day in office, we have worked to get the funding levels for this account increased.  From letters to leadership, to hearings, to one on one meetings, we have worked extremely hard to get this increase and I could not be happier to see it come to fruition,” stated Amata.  Since 1974, Congress has included funding in the Interior Appropriations bill for certain American Samoa Government operations, including LBJ Medical Center, the local judiciary, American Samoa Community College, and other Department of Education operations.  In 1974 the funding level was approximately $17 million, where it remained until 1986 when it was increased to $22.75 million annually.  The FY-2018 bill includes a recommendation for American Samoa Government Operations to be raised to $23,002,222, an increase of $250,000 above the fiscal year 2017 enacted level.  The increase comes despite the proposed $1.4 million cut to the account requested by the administration.  Had the proposed cut gone into effect, the FY-2018 funding level would have been approximately $21.3 million…which would have certainly been difficult for the ASG to absorb.  “Getting any increase in funding for our beautiful home is always a win for our people, but I am determined to continue working to see that funding for this account is increased even more in the future.  In fact, I would like to see the CPI formula applied to the account, which would allow for future increases to be based on inflation and other economic factors,” stated Amata.  I want to thank Chairman Calvert for working with us closely on this issue, and really listening to the needs of the island and the funding shortfalls we are facing.  He is a true friend to American Samoa, and I am grateful for his leadership,” concluded the Congresswoman.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/photos/a.1538865479736363.1073741828.1537155909907320/1961690190787221/?type=3",NA,92,15,22,33,0,2,0,0

Earlier this week, my colleagues and I in the House Veterans Affairs Committee passed The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017. This bill will help reform the G.I. Bill for the 21st century. Read my PR here:  Washington, D.C. –Friday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata, and the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs passed a series of bills out of mark-up yesterday including H.R. 3218, The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017. H.R. 3218 will make several improvements for veteran and service member education covered under the G.I. Bill.  “I am very proud of this fact, and repeat it every chance I get…that my home district of American Samoa has the highest rate of recruitment in the nation,” stated Amata. “One of the main influences that draws our young people to the recruiting station in Pago Pago is the G.I. Bill incentive.  For many years now, the young people of American Samoa have utilized the G.I. Bill to gain access to a higher education upon completion of their service to the nation.  Many have gone on to do great things with those degrees, and I am excited to see this historic program expanded and improved,” she continued.  Major Provisions of the Bill would:  • Remove time restrictions to use the GI Bill for future eligible recipients. This would allow them able to use their GI bill benefits for their entire life as opposed to the current 15-year timeline. Eligible recipients would be service members, veterans and surviving spouses and children; • Provide significant increases in GI Bill funding for Reservists and Guardsmen, dependents, surviving spouses, and surviving dependents;  • Provide 100% GI Bill eligibility to Post 9/11 Purple Heart recipients;  • Provide GI Bill eligibility to Reservists and Guardsmen who are currently being put on active duty and convalescent medical leave orders that do not currently accrue GI Bill eligibility;  • Provide an extra academic year’s worth of Post 9/11 benefits for over 3,300 veterans (per year) to help them finish a STEM degree; • Create a pilot program that would pay for veterans to take certain high technology courses (coding boot camps, IT certifications etc.) and would also provide living stipends to veterans;  • Make it easier and cheaper for veterans to use their GI bill to take national tests or tests that lead to a license or credential;  • Restore eligibility for service members whose school closes in the middle of a semester (ex. ITT Tech and Corinthian); and  • Authorize funding for IT improvements to ensure that GI Bill claims are processed quickly and accurately.  “I want to thank Committee Chairman Phil Roe and Ranking Member Tim Walz for their work on H.R. 3218, and I also want to applaud all the members whose provisions have been included in this landmark legislation.

I greatly appreciate the continuing work of Chairman Phil Roe and all the Members of the Committee on these ongoing issues, as well as today’s action by Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin.”  The White House and the V.A. today announced a program called VA Video Connect that allows VA healthcare providers to use mobile devices to connect with veterans on their personal mobile devices, including smart phones or tablets, or their home computers. They also announced a new technology called the Veterans Appointment Request (mobile.va.gov/appstore). This allows a veteran to schedule or manage their appointments directly with VA providers.   Telehealth is a growing concept that should eventually allow veterans to access their doctor remotely using the internet without being restricted by state lines. This upgrade in service is particularly important to American Samoan veterans who otherwise would need to travel to see a physician, and often need to speak to doctors in Honolulu or elsewhere.  “This is a great example of working to remove an outdated obstacle for people,” Aumua Amata continued. “In my service on the Health Subcommittee, we’ve discussed the need for the best possible health care to veterans everywhere, and I’m pleased to see important progress made. I will continue to work on legislative solutions for full telehealth access to doctors.”","link","http://mobile.va.gov/appstore","mobile.va.gov",11,1,1,2,0,0,0,0

The FCC responded today granting the waiver allowing ASTCA to proceed with buildouts of the LTE high speed wireless infrastructure. The ASTCA petition was able to successfully show that the waiver was in the public interest and within FCC precedents.  “This keeps the focus on the goal of making these communications services more widely available in American Samoa,” Amata said. “Today’s decision by the FCC removes this concern and allows ASTCA to proceed with the next steps in providing these much-needed services.”","status",NA,NA,9,1,1,3,0,0,0,0

The program was started in 2014 to ensure veterans can get services in their own communities, and the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act preserves that effort, prevents any interruption in services, and expands its reach through the new funds. Finally, the Act also strengthens the VA by investing in recruitment and retention of medical professionals and the VA workforce.

Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Aumua Amata today welcomed this week’s effort by the Small Business Committee examining the need to strengthen small businesses and streamline the federal process of obtaining permits.  “We depend on small businesses in American Samoa, and want federal policies to encourage them to experience growth, help their communities and create jobs,” said Aumua Amata. “Federal permits serve a purpose, but often that purpose gets weighed down in such a complicated process that it becomes an unnecessary burden on a small business. An owner of a corner shop could run into so many costs and delays that it struggles to get started or stay open.”  On Wednesday, the House Small Business Committee held a hearing titled Expediting Economic Growth: How Streamlining Federal Permitting Can Cut Red Tape for Small Businesses. Specifically, the Committee heard testimony on the ways that multiple agencies often overlap on oversight of a single small business project, causing delays and extra expenses.   “Unlike larger corporations, a small business in American Samoa doesn’t start out with a staff of lawyers, accountants and other experts to handle all the federal requirements, so it’s important to examine ways to simplify this process for them,” continued the Congresswoman. “Most new or expanding small businesses must start out by getting a series of government permits allowing them to build, acquire property, sell a product or provide services. Ideally, these regulations should be a safety net that act more as guidance to small businesses and not an obstacle.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/photos/a.1538865479736363.1073741828.1537155909907320/1986054768350763/?type=3",NA,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

American Samoan businesses can access some programs remotely, but I hope to see these opportunities increasingly able to reach American Samoa more consistently.”  The hearing benefited from an expert group of witnesses testifying on behalf of the Association of Women’s Business Centers, America’s Small Business Development Centers, SCORE Association, and the Veterans Business Outreach Center.   Congresswoman Amata’s first questions to the witnesses regarded the availability of SBA services in remote locations, including American Samoa, that do not have “brick and mortar” facilities for their programs. For instance, the nearest SBA Small Business Development Center is in Hawaii; however, some programs, such as SCORE webinars might be available to American Samoan businesses. The hearing examined how the Small Business Administration’s Entrepreneurial Development programs are changing their training and counseling programs to reflect the market’s increased reliance on technology.   “SBA programs can help small businesses navigate technology changes,” continued Congresswoman Amata. “Ultimately, we want technology not to leave small businesses behind, but to lift them up.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/photos/a.1538865479736363.1073741828.1537155909907320/1989001788056061/?type=3",NA,12,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

In July, she had the opportunity to introduce the nominee to the Senate Committee that first considered his nomination, and she is pleased to congratulate Assistant Secretary Domenech today.  “I want to congratulate Assistant Secretary Domenech, who is a good friend, and highly qualified for the position,” Aumua Amata said. “This leadership role is important to American Samoa and all the people of the Insular areas. The Assistant Secretary’s knowledge and experience of the mission of the office is unparalleled, and I know that he will be an energetic public servant on behalf of the people in these areas.”  Assistant Secretary Domenech was already serving as the Senior Advisor to the Secretary of the Interior, and is also Secretary Zinke’s appointee to the Advisory Council of the Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico, where he has lived and from where his family originally hails. Previously, he served as the Secretary of Natural Resources for the Commonwealth of Virginia, and in that role, he had responsibility for overseeing six state environmental, recreation, and historic resource agencies.  “I again want to thank the Assistant Secretary for his willingness to serve our great country,” continued the Congresswoman. “My friend Doug was always a great choice for this role, and I know he’s ready and up to the challenge ahead.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/photos/a.1538865479736363.1073741828.1537155909907320/1989422054680701/?type=3",NA,8,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Today, our Veterans Health Hearing examined a number of proposed bills, and I highlighted the need for better access for veterans in American Samoa. Keep reading for more details.  Washington, D.C. – Tuesday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata highlighted the healthcare needs of American Samoan veterans in a Veterans’ Affairs Health Subcommittee hearing to examine up to ten veterans’ health related bills that are under early consideration in the Committee, including draft legislation to improve the VA’s Health Professional Educational Assistance Program. “The VA’s Health Professional Educational Assistance Program is aimed at correcting the VA’s shortfall in available healthcare professionals – a problem that is even more apparent in American Samoa,” said Aumua Amata. “In American Samoa, it is difficult to find the needed physical therapists and other specialists for the VA Clinic, and there is no VA hospital. We must thoroughly examine this challenge and take steps to better deliver services on site in American Samoa and look for ways to reduce costs for veterans who currently travel to Hawaii for many procedures.” Specifically, the draft legislation for the Health Professional Educational Assistance Program would seek to increase scholarships for students in pursuing studies to be a doctor or dentist, along with requiring VA Clinic service; medical scholarships for veterans; loan repayment for new medical graduates in residency that are in shortage fields and provide clinical service at a VA facility. The hearing included input from numerous Members of Congress and veterans organizations, including the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW), Vietnam Veterans of America, Blinded Veterans of America, Disabled American Veterans, Justice for Vets, and Paralyzed Veterans of America. “I’m pleased that Members of Congress of both parties take the needs of our veterans seriously and are participating in the effort to improve access to services for veterans,” continued Congresswoman Amata. “I will continue to ensure that the needs of American Samoa are known in Washington, D.C., and keep working through legislative means to increase healthcare choices for American Samoa’s veterans.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/photos/a.1538865479736363.1073741828.1537155909907320/1994581270831446/?type=3",NA,12,0,3,3,0,0,0,0

Today, our hearing explored causes and responses to major wildfires in western states, and I was able to recognize and thank American Samoan firefighters which have joined those efforts. Press Release below:  Washington, D.C. – Wednesday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata participated in a hearing exploring wildfire solutions, and highlighted the contributions of American Samoa’s firefighters. “In recent years, firefighters from American Samoa have traveled more than once to join the fight against major fires in the western United States, including this August, and I was pleased to commend their efforts before other Members of Congress,” said Aumua Amata. “This year, millions of acres of forest have been lost, but studying this year’s wildfires and response efforts can yield valuable information to prepare for future disaster responses.” The hearing, titled Exploring Solutions to Reduce Risks of Catastrophic Wildfire and Improve Resiliency of National Forests, explored the possible reasons behind the severity of the damage this year, then examined possible ways to improve the response and reduce the risk.  The Congresswoman’s full prepared remarks to the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations are below: Thank you, Mr. Chairman for holding this oversight hearing to explore solutions to reduce the risks of wildfires.  You know Mr. Chairman – as we all do – when the fire bell rings, there are no politics among the response of our brave men and women in the firefighting corps. The firefighting family is a very close knit group extending throughout the United States and all its territories, including a small place where I come from, American Samoa. Firefighters from American Samoa based in the National Park of American Samoa just this past August recently fought side by side with their fellow fire fighters in Modoc National Forest in Alturas, California and Sheehy Memorial Fitness Park in Redding, California last year. The Samoan firefighting crew responded to the call to help their fellow firefighters in multiple instances in California and Nevada over the past several years. There is a long and proud tradition of courage in both Samoan and firefighting culture and I commend all the firefighters in the States and Territories for putting themselves in harm’s way in order to protect the natural beauty of all of our Parks for the recreation and enjoyment of everyone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman for your leadership.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/photos/a.1538865479736363.1073741828.1537155909907320/1994942604128646/?type=3",NA,11,0,3,2,0,0,0,0

Thompson serves as vice chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, and Chairman of its Subcommittee on Nutrition. He traveled to American Samoa in February to directly observe more about the economy and agriculture of the islands. “I appreciate today’s Roundtable discussion and the innovative thinking of the entrepreneurs that were there to share ideas,” said Aumua Amata. “I’m pleased that through the Small Business Committee we have opportunities to refine small business priorities in Congress.” Specifically, the Roundtable heard directly from small business leaders on the topic of Private Sector Entrepreneurial Development Initiatives.

I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for holding this important meeting on tax reform.  Over 95% of businesses located in my home of American Samoa are small businesses. On top of all the other issues that small business in American Samoa faces is that the IRS treats businesses incorporated in the territories as foreign companies – which creates a perverse incentive that to discourages territorial small businesses from expanding to the mainland.  All five territories are facing severe crises – from natural disasters to economic collapse. Growth of small businesses can ensure sustainability and reduce the volatility of the territories. My hope is that we can work together to promote small business growth in the territories – and encourage a change to the tax code that would incentivize and not deter small business growth in American Samoa, CNMI, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the USVI.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/photos/a.1538865479736363.1073741828.1537155909907320/1997800873842819/?type=3",NA,15,0,1,2,0,0,0,0

I introduced legislation today called the American Samoa Investment Act to encourage job creation. My bill takes a little explaining, so read on for the details:  Washington, D.C. – Thursday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata introduced legislation to improve job creation opportunities in American Samoa and increase the potential of attracting foreign investors by fixing a gap in the EB-5 Visa requirements that directly affects American Samoa.  “Current law has a significant job creation incentive that ignores American Samoa and U.S. Nationals, in favor of not only citizens but also green card holders, and we need to be included,” said Aumua Amata. “This is a matter of simple fairness and common sense. Under current law, American Samoa is at a unique disadvantage on the EB-5 Visa job creation incentive, and there’s no apparent reason for this provision to exclude jobs for U.S. Nationals. My legislation would correct the problem and level the playing field for American Samoa.” Specifically, through the EB-5 Visa program, the law provides an incentive for foreign investors to start a business in the U.S. or U.S. territories if that business will create jobs for ten people. However, those employees are specified as U.S. citizens or green card holders, meaning that – as written – the law that’s in place doesn’t apply the same incentive in American Samoa, where the available workforce is primarily made up of U.S. nationals. The Congresswoman’s bill, entitled the American Samoa Investment Act, eliminates this gap in the law and includes U.S. Nationals in this job creation incentive.  “I want to thank my friends, Congresswoman Jenniffer González-Colón of Puerto Rico and Congressman Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, for joining me in this effort,” continued Congresswoman Amata. “This measure could be an important deciding factor for a future employer. My legislation would promote a fair and reasonable solution, and I am working to get the word out in Washington, D.C.”","link","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/","facebook.com",11,1,0,4,0,0,0,0

Yesterday, I wrote a letter with Rep.Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan of the Marianas Islands and Rep. Madeleine Z. Bordallo of Guam, calling for a hearing to examine the issues that our veterans' face. Below is our joint press release. The photos are our joint letter.  Washington, D.C. –Thursday, Congresswoman Aumua Amata (R-AS) along with her colleagues Congressman Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan (D- CNMI) and Congresswoman Madeleine Z. Bordallo (D-GU) wrote to Chairman Phil Roe and Ranking Member Tim Walz of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs requesting an oversight hearing to examine the challenges facing veterans residing in American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Independent Samoa, and the Freely Associated States. The Representatives noted that these areas suffer from minimal involvement by the national Department of Veterans’ Affairs.    “American Samoans enlist in the United States Army at a rate higher than any other place in the United States. American Samoa has also one of the highest percentage of veteran population of any area of the United States. Yet veterans in American Samoa must travel over 2,500 miles to receive care in Hawai’i, and that’s not to mention the lack of any benefits counselors in Americans Samoa. American Samoans have served with distinction in the US Armed Forces for over a hundred years. It’s time they received the care that they are owed,” said Aumua Amata.  “The Northern Marianas is the only U.S. jurisdiction without a VA clinic, dedicated VA medical or mental health professionals, or a Vet Center,” said Congressman Sablan. “Our veterans have to travel to Guam or Hawaii to receive basic medical care.  The VA must do more for the veterans in the Northern Marianas who served our country with honor and distinction. Veterans in the Pacific territories are entitled to the benefits they earned and should be able to access those benefits where they live.”    Said Congresswoman Bordallo, “Veterans in Guam and the Pacific territories should be treated equitably with their counterparts in the mainland, and receive the level of benefits they have earned from their service to our nation. Unfortunately our veterans continue to experience significant challenges, especially in receiving timely and accessible health care. While I was successful in obtaining funding to remodel and expand Guam’s CBOC and in requiring the GAO to review the level of care provided to veterans in the Pacific, both of which are ongoing, I have been frustrated by continued short staffing levels on Guam and lack of resources dedicated to the needs of our veterans. I hope the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee will work diligently to provide appropriate oversight for the concerns on Guam, American Samoa, the CNMI, and other Pacific islands. I look forward to working with Congresswoman Amata and Congressman Sablan, and the Veterans Affairs Committee, to improve services provided to veterans in the Pacific.”  Congresswoman Aumua Amata and Congressman Sablan are members of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs and sit on the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs.

My goal was to focus attention on the loss of income that so many in American Samoa are facing because of the shutdown that impacts workers, their families and all the small businesses.” Last week, Congresswoman Amata also released a Public Comment letter to the U.S. Department of Justice and the overseeing Judge, to urge them to strongly consider legal precedents potentially allowing parties to the Starkist Consent Decree to agree to set aside settlement funds to the benefit of the affected workers. Full text of the Congresswoman’s remarks in the House of Representatives are below: Mr. Speaker,  I rise in care and concern for my people in American Samoa in a time of need. I’m humbled to represent them to you now. Over this Thanksgiving, over 2,000 of our families are being put out of work and small businesses will lose commerce, as American Samoa’s largest employer closes for a period of six weeks. The Department of Justice-Starkist Consent Decree requires payment of $6.3 million. Unfortunately, this money comes to Washington, DC. The workers and their families lose their paychecks. The small businesses around them absorb losses. That’s wrong. These funds should stay on island to help them through this time. In fact, a case won by our Attorney General Talauega Eleasalo Alo establishes the unique economic responsibility the U.S. has to American Samoa through the Deed of Cession. American Samoa has high unemployment and low incomes. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the burden our federal government is placing on American Samoa this Thanksgiving.

My colleagues on this Committee, Chairman Roe, and Secretary Shulkin are determined to improve access for our veterans, and I’d like to thank each of them for their leadership and dedication.” Specifically, the legislation under consideration would seek to improve the Veterans Choice Program, expand VA authority to enter agreements at the state level to provide nursing home care, strengthen graduate medical education residency positions and broaden community care options through the Veteran Coordinates Access and Rewarding Experiences (CARE) Act. The hearing included testimony from Dr. David Shulkin, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, followed by representatives of the Disabled American Veterans, the American Legion, and Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW), along with Statements for the Record contributed by more than 20 health and veterans organizations. “I see these legislative proposals as incremental progress toward better care in remote areas, changes that can serve as a good foundation for more work toward the readily accessible care we need in American Samoa,” continued Congresswoman Amata. “Improving access through telehealth, and encouraging more medical specialists remains a priority, so that our veterans have lower costs and better choices.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/photos/a.1538865479736363.1073741828.1537155909907320/2007040782918828/?type=3",NA,26,2,5,6,0,0,0,0

Good news…a veterans hearing that we requested will be scheduled sometime in the second session of the 115th Congress to examine the challenges of our veterans in Pacific insular areas. Read the press release below: Congresswoman Amata led a bipartisan letter earlier this month, joined by her colleagues Congressman Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan (D-CNMI) and Congresswoman Madeleine Z. Bordallo (D-GU), to Chairman Phil Roe and Ranking Member Tim Walz of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, requesting an oversight hearing to examine the challenges facing veterans residing in American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and elsewhere in the Pacific. The Representatives noted that these areas suffer from minimal involvement by the national Department of Veterans’ Affairs.   Chairman Roe replied today with his intention to move forward with plans for the requested hearing in the second session of the current Congress. “Ensuring that all of our nation’s veterans have access to the health care and other services they need to live healthy, full lives is my top priority as Chairman. To that end, I would be pleased to work with you to schedule a hearing on Pacific insular area veteran access to care in the second session of the 115th Congress,” states the Chairman in his letter. “I look forward to working with you to address the issues Pacific insular area veterans face and I thank you both for bringing their concerns to my attention and for all your hard work and leadership on behalf of America’s veterans wherever they may reside,” continued the Chairman in his reply. “This is great news for our veterans, and I look forward to examining these issues in a hearing dedicated to that purpose,” said Aumua Amata. “I appreciate my colleagues, Congressman Sablan and Congresswoman Bordallo, who joined me in this request regarding these priorities that we share. I am especially grateful to Chairman Roe for caring deeply about our veterans, and his willingness to plan this hearing. I also want to thank Ranking Member Walz, and assure our veterans that we will continue to examine ways to improve access to health care in remote areas.”","status",NA,NA,17,6,3,1,0,0,0,0

I attended this week’s Congressional Gold Medal ceremony for Filipino World War II veterans who fought under the flag of the United States. (Press release below)  “It was special to be there in honor of these veterans and their courageous service, along with members of both parties and an audience of 650 people in beautiful Emancipation Hall, to witness this moving ceremony,” said Aumua Amata. “The Congressional Gold Medal is Congress’s highest honor, and this presentation will preserve the history of their heroic service for generations to follow.” In World War II, about 260,000 Filipino soldiers fought under the flag of the U.S., and 57,000 Filipino troops died. Many of the surviving soldiers became U.S. citizens, and since the Philippines at that time was a U.S. commonwealth, all of them were U.S. Nationals. Sadly, they were not provided the same benefits and recognitions as the rest of the U.S. military in the decades following the war. More than 70 years after the end of the war, their service was honored this week in the U.S. Capitol, and will never be forgotten. The Gold Medals were struck by the United States Mint and specially inscribed with the names of prominent battle areas in which they served.  “All of us should be deeply appreciative to see this honor bestowed on behalf of those who fought for freedom,” continued Congresswoman Amata. “I’m especially pleased to know that children and young people from the Filipino community here in American Samoa, and all over the United States, will learn more about this heritage of bravery and service, and know that their sacrifices were for a great purpose.” Pictured: I’m with Reynaldo Pascua, President of the Filipino-American Community of Yakima Valley, who was at the Capitol for the ceremony.

I delivered the most recent Congressional Western Caucus Weekly Address, aired on Saturday, and highlighted legislation passed by the Natural Resources Committee that would ensure future marine monuments could only be created with local/territorial input and through congressional action, to avoid bureaucratic overreach. I shared remarks about American Samoa’s traditional fishing and Fa’a Samoa with the Western Caucus viewership. Pictured: I'm speaking with White House OMB Director Mulvaney outside of the Western Caucus meeting last week. Text of my Congressional Western Caucus Weekly Address is below: Talofa! I’m pleased to join you today with an update for the Western Caucus. I’m proud to represent American Samoa, a beautiful group of seven islands in the Pacific Ocean. We may not be the first place you think of in the Western Caucus! I joined this Caucus, not just because we are thousands of miles to the West of most of the country, but because of shared interests and priorities. For instance, we have two rainy seasons, so we aren’t as likely to see a furious wildfire like those causing so much damage this year in the western U.S.  Instead, our highly trained teams of expert firefighters went and joined those efforts. When the fire bell rings, that’s what firefighters do – they respond, and wherever they are from, we’re proud of them all.  Like other parts of the West, we in American Samoa have beautiful places and coastlines, including national park and monument areas that cover both sea and land. I’m very proud of the work the Western Caucus has put into these issues, and the leadership of so many of my colleagues. In each of our districts, our monument area might look a little different from another place, but there are important underlying issues that are the same. For instance, is there good local input from the people who know the area best? We’re working together in Congress to ensure state, local and territorial input for monument decisions. That’s just common sense. Protecting beautiful places doesn’t have to cause harm to nearby small businesses. That’s why a bureaucracy in Washington, D.C., shouldn’t be the only one with a voice.  In American Samoa, decisions in Washington about a marine monument placed our traditional fishing waters off limits, despite generations of use. Fishing is part of our heritage and Fa’a Samoa, our way of life. We’re working together so that Congress must be consulted on future marine monument decisions, so the people living there are truly represented – just as the country’s founders intended. That’s just a small part of what the Western Caucus is all about, and that’s why we work together in Congress to keep these beautiful places – mountains, deserts, and islands – not only beautiful, but also free, prosperous and respectful of our heritage. Thank you.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/photos/a.1538865479736363.1073741828.1537155909907320/2009254449364128/?type=3",NA,13,0,3,0,0,0,0,0

In a Natural Resources Committee hearing today, I had the opportunity to emphasize several shared challenges that the territories face. In my remarks, I urged support for strong infrastructure in the territories and equitable health care treatment with the states, and highlighted American Samoa’s shared need with the U.S. Virgin Islands for a 2019 Medicaid extension to spend down funds. Finally, the territories also share a similar need for economic development tax credit initiatives in any final major tax legislation. (Pictured: Greeting USVI Gov Mapp, and exchanging Medicaid comments with him during the hearing. Press release continues below.)  “While Irma and Maria were two of the worst hurricanes in recent history, the fact remains that the insular territories are no strangers to natural disasters,” said Aumua Amata. “Hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other disasters are an unfortunate part of the natural order of living on an island, making it imperative that we do all we can to prepare for them in advance. The insular territories are particularly susceptible, as they are isolated from receiving help from the rest of the country and often suffer more damage from disasters based on their relative size. We will do everything we can to help Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands get back on their feet, but we cannot stop there. We need to strengthen infrastructure and foster stability in all the territories before the next disaster.”  On Nov. 14, the Committee on Natural Resources held an oversight hearing titled “The Need for Transparent Financial Accountability in Territories’ Disaster Recovery Efforts.” The Committee heard testimony directly from the two territories’ governors: The Honorable Ricardo Rosselló, Governor of Puerto Rico; and the Honorable Kenneth Mapp, Governor of the United States Virgin Islands. The hearing focused on where recovery support is most needed, and efforts to prevent spending waste through oversight.  In her exchange of remarks with Governor Mapp, Congresswoman Amata focused attention on American Samoa and the Virgin Islands shared difficulty spending down Medicaid funds granted under the ACA, due to lack of resources and matching fund requirements, and the concept of an extension for the funds expiring in 2019, along with the need for equitable treatment with the states.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/aumuaamata/photos/a.1538865479736363.1073741828.1537155909907320/2016137828675790/?type=3",NA,11,0,2,2,0,0,0,0
