There are great people doing incredible work, but the island was absolutely devastated and no place was spared. They're in need of continuing short-term response and a long-term recovery plan. Debris has been cleared enough to allow access to urban areas, but the mountains are still tough to reach. There have been hundreds of air drops, but getting food, water, and medical supplies to remote areas is an ongoing effort.   Getting the electrical grid up and running is essential. Most of the energy right now is by generator, but that's not a long-term solution. The Army Corps of Engineers is working to get the grid repaired, and they've ordered 50,000 utility poles plus thousands of miles of cables.

For every dollar we send to Washington, we get about 80 cents back. We’re already subsidizing the rest of the country, which is why I’ve been fighting non-stop to maintain the state and local tax deduction. Eliminating this deduction means the federal government will tax you on the taxes you already pay to the state and the city. It’s unfair, not conservative, and would devastate middle class families in our community.   The tax code is too complex and in desperate need of reform, but Staten Island and Brooklyn residents shouldn't foot the bill for tax relief for other states -- especially ones that already receive far more than they give to the federal government. I’ve made that point clear over the past few months, and I remain steadfast in my commitment to fixing these bills.","link","https://www.apnews.com/2f83c72de1bd440d92cdbc0d3b6bc08c/AP-FACT-CHECK:-Blue-high-tax-states-fund-red-low-tax-states","apnews.com",143,70,30,10,1,2,0,11

Not only are these types of lone wolf attacks becoming all too common, but terrorists are increasingly turning everyday tools, such as vehicles, into weapons.

The geopolitical arena is competitive and cutthroat – we cannot expect other sovereign nations to just sing Kumbaya and support our goals. Power is what moves nations, and it’s about time our country started projecting ours. When we draw a line in the sand, the world should know that it matters.

However, the bill that came out of the conference committee still means a tax increase for many Staten Island and Brooklyn residents. My priority always has and will continue to be the people of Staten Island and Brooklyn who sent me to Congress to represent them. Their interests come before Washington, always.  For months, I’ve been fighting tooth and nail, together with Republican Reps. Peter King, Lee Zeldin, John Faso, and Elise Stefanik to protect the state and local tax deduction. Capping this deduction – which has been a part of the U.S. tax code since 1913 – will increase taxes and harm the already-unaffordable housing market in my district. Former President Ronald Reagan didn't eliminate SALT when he had the chance in 1986 due to conservative principles, and we shouldn’t remove it now. Additionally, analyses show that New York’s share of the country’s tax burden will grow by 9 percent – the largest increase of any state in the nation. Even this small capped deduction of $10,000 will be eliminated in 8 years, and once it’s gone it probably will be eliminated forever.  We’ve taken our case to Congressional leadership, the public, and directly to the President. Sometimes that fight has been heated, but that’s our job: to look out for the families in our districts who are already living paycheck to paycheck. Our efforts resulted in some positive developments, like the protection of student loan interest and medical expense deductions, but it still falls short of accomplishing the goals that I strongly believed we could and should have achieved.  With the state and local tax deduction nearly eliminated, this tax bill doesn't equal relief for far too many New Yorkers. It is still paid for by the middle-class families of Staten Island and Brooklyn. New York is a high-tax state, and this legislation should serve as a wakeup call to politicians who have been taxing and spending with little regard for the taxpayer. But that still doesn't make it right to penalize people even more. My responsibility and allegiance is to the people who sent me here, and I will not support a tax hike on the people I represent.","link","https://donovan.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/statement-congressman-dan-donovan-final-tax-bill","donovan.house.gov",181,128,15,9,0,1,4,21
