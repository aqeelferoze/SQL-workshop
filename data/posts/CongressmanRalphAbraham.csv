HR 29: To terminate the Internal Revenue Code… This bill sets a date to terminate massive parts of the tax code to force Congress to act to make reforms in a timely fashion.  2. HR 38: This bill allows nationwide concealed carry reciprocity so we can better protect the rights of gun owners wherever they legally choose to carry their firearms.  3. HR 71: This bill forces federal agencies to disclose the cost, effectiveness and duplication of services so we can eliminate waste and fraud in our government.  4. HR 80: This bill suspends refugees from entering the United States until we determine how much accepting these refugees will cost the country.  5. HR 184: This bill repeals the taxes on medical devices.  6: HR 198: Repeals the federal estate tax… The No. 1 killer of family farms is estate taxes. When a loved one dies, the family who inherits the farm can’t pay the estate taxes, so they break up the farms and sell off the land.  7: H Res 11: This resolution objects to the UN Security Council Resolution that betrayed our great friends in the Middle East, Israel.  8: H Res 14: This resolution objects to the Obama Administration’s outrageous decision not to veto the anti-Israel UN resolution.","status",NA,NA,408,65,156,32,0,5,0,0

What he should be doing is apologizing to the American people for his many broken promises.   He should apologize for telling us our premiums would decline by $2,500 per family. The average annual family premium is now $4,300 higher and costs about $18,000 annually.  He should apologize for telling us, ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it."" Access to plans is more limited than ever before, limiting the number of doctors and hospitals you can use. Meanwhile, insurance companies are leaving at breakneck speeds because of the losses they're taking from Obamacare.  He should apologize to those of us in rural America who have lost 80 hospitals since Obamacare started. Nearly 700 others are in jeopardy of closing.  He should apologize to American workers who can't find full-time work because of the employer mandate that raises costs and forces tax penalties on business owners.  He should apologize to the taxpayers as the administrative costs of Obamacare have tripled and now costs about $9.75 billion to run the program.  Even though the President broke his promises to you, the new Republican Congress and Donald J.

Today I have a choice: keep Obamacare or keep my promise, and I will vote to keep my promise.    Obamacare is a demonstrated failure, but what we had before wasn’t working, either. As Congress, we must act and implement a system that provides patient-centered care and access to health care for all Americans at affordable prices. This legislation (the AHCA) goes a long way toward accomplishing those goals. Some highlights of the AHCA include:    - Ending the un-American individual mandate that requires people to purchase health insurance or pay a tax penalty to the IRS  - Repealing billions of dollars in job-killing taxes and mandates  - Providing for the largest reform to Medicaid in history by allowing states to implement work requirements for certain beneficiaries, require drug tests for beneficiaries, and require that beneficiaries pay premiums and copayments - all of which will control costs and reduce fraud and abuse while providing affordable access to care  - Gutting funding for Planned Parenthood by reducing federal funds for the abortion provider by nearly 90 percent  Health care reform must be taken in steps. What we couldn't get perfect in this bill, we'll continue to work on alongside President Trump.

No bill is perfect, but this legislation was to be the first step of many to truly reform our health care system.   Our Founders established a government that strives toward compromise, and I applaud President Donald J. Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan on all of their hard work to strike that compromise. But to my Republican colleagues on the Freedom Caucus who caucused with Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats to keep Obamacare and funding for Planned Parenthood today, I’d remind them that the American people sent us here to govern, and governing is much harder than just saying “no” to every proposal that isn’t perfect.","status",NA,NA,341,87,61,5,7,1,27,37

I know many, many veterans across North Louisiana who rely on this hospital for their care. They are fine people who do not deserve to be caught in the middle of the scandals of bureaucrats.  But if there is a silver lining to this story, it's that there seems to finally be some measure of accountability from the administration. When the wait time scandal first broke several years ago, the House immediately wrote and passed laws to bring more accountability to the VA so we could hold those who fail our veterans accountable. The problem was that the former administration seemed unwilling to stand up to the public unions, so nothing changed.

With control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, I believe conservatives have a tremendous opportunity to not only significantly rein in deficit spending, but also redirect money from bad programs to good ones. I’m not convinced the omnibus achieved those goals, and I hope Congress will work over the next several months to produce the type of responsible spending bill the American people demanded in the last election.  Problems with the omnibus:   • While the omnibus preserves the Hyde Amendment, there is no legislative guarantee that federal funds will stop going to abortion provider Planned Parenthood. Federal funds allow Planned Parenthood to pay for support operations while it uses its own resources to facilitate and perform abortions.  • The omnibus fails to fund the military at the levels requested by President Trump and military leaders. Rather than continue wasteful spending, Congress should have directed more money to ensure that our military has all of the resources its leaders say they need.  • The omnibus does not provide funding for the border wall, a principle goal of the Trump administration and a needed deterrent to prevent illegal immigration and the flow of drugs.  • The omnibus falls well short of any requested disaster aid. Additionally, there are no guarantees that a majority of the provided funds earmarked for disasters will go to Louisiana, nor are there any guarantees that the funds Louisiana does receive will go toward directly assisting middle-income flood victims, nor are there any guarantees that victims of the March 2016 flood will receive any support.  • The omnibus does not reduce the deficit, which means the United States will continue to add to the nearly $20 trillion national debt, an irresponsible amount of debt to heap upon future generations of Americans who did not create this problem.  • The omnibus bails out Puerto Rico and perpetuates the territory’s continued inability to take responsibility for fiscal problems it has created.","status",NA,NA,202,51,17,4,0,0,2,1

His plan repeals nearly $1 trillion in taxes, which paves the way for true tax reform. It gives money back to the states to construct health care plans that work for their patients, scrapping the one-size-fits-all Obamacare mandate. It defunds Planned Parenthood. Passing this bill would allow the House to possibly strengthen it even further.  Let’s be clear: This is our last opportunity to end Obamacare as we know it. While Democrats are debating whether to keep the failed status quo or adopt a socialist single-payer government takeover of health care, Bill Cassidy and I are doing what we can to provide patients with choices in their health care. Sen. Cassidy’s plan takes a great leap forward from what we’ve got now, and I hope the Senate adopts his plan.","status",NA,NA,462,87,63,12,1,0,4,29

I believe that YOU know best how to spend your money, not the government, and you deserve to keep more of your hard-earned dollars to spend as you see fit. Additionally, we lowered the corporate tax rate from the highest in the world to a competitive rate that will lead to more jobs, higher wages, and more investment in American communities.  To see your new tax rate and how much of a tax cut you'll receive, see this analysis from the Tax Foundation: https://taxfoundation.org/final-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-details-analysis/","link","https://taxfoundation.org/final-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-details-analysis/","taxfoundation.org",324,66,36,35,2,0,0,12

They know that America will stand with them because of President Trump’s response. It shows that America will lead again. Obama sided with the Ayatollah and the murderous Revolutionary Guards back in 2009 when the protests were going on then while Trump sides with the people who are sick and tired of Iran’s oppressive and deadly rule. Think what a huge difference it would have made if Iran had been forced to a better place back then -think how many thousands of lives including American soldiers that possibly would have been saved.","status",NA,NA,181,31,5,11,2,1,1,0
