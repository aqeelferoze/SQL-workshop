This bill will be disastrous for our citizens and I cannot stay silent about the adverse effects it will have on the lives of everyday Americans.   Each day until we vote, I will highlight the different aspects of the proposed budget that will negatively affect families in Louisiana.  Today, my focus is on Medicare and Medicaid. Funding for these two programs is vital to the thousands of Louisiana citizens who have gained affordable healthcare under these programs, especially our senior citizens for whom Medicare is their sole source of coverage. This budget demonstrates the GOP’s willingness to attack vulnerable, hard-working Americans to benefit the wealthy.  Have you and your family benefitted from Medicare or Medicaid?
