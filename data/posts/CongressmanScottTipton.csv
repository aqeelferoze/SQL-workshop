However, I am concerned about the impact that the President’s executive order is having on individuals who have visas or green cards. Individuals who have already been vetted and granted visas or permanent resident status should not be impacted by the executive order, and putting them under the umbrella of this order’s reach – no matter where they come from – will further damage an already-flawed immigration system.  Last year, top national security advisors under the Obama Administration told Congress that they do not have the ability to verify the identities of refugees fleeing Syria for the United States. Until we have this ability, I do not think it is unreasonable to halt resettlement, however, the executive order needs to be clarified, as its impacts on law abiding visa and green card holders are unacceptable. We are a compassionate nation that continues to be built by immigrants, but unfortunately bad actors try to use our compassion to do harm. Government’s priority must be to keep Americans safe, and I believe that can be done while still maintaining a generous immigration system that ensures those who wish to harm Americans do not slip through the cracks.","link","http://tipton.house.gov/press-release/tipton-responds-president%E2%80%99s-executive-order-immigration","tipton.house.gov",52,56,10,0,0,0,1,10

Community rating regulations under the ACA placed limitations on how much an insurance company could vary insurance rates for individuals in the same geographic area based on their health status. The AHCA does not repeal the ACA community rating regulations.   The AHCA gives states the ability to seek a waiver from the community rating regulations, but in order to request a waiver, the state must establish a risk-sharing program to ensure uninsured individuals who may be viewed as “high-risk” by an insurance company still have access to affordable health insurance.  Further, even if a state chooses to seek a waiver and establish a risk-sharing program, any person who maintains continuous insurance coverage cannot have the community rating provision applied to them by an insurance company. To maintain the standard of continuous coverage, a person could not let their insurance lapse for more than 63 days, and insurance obtained through an employer, COBRA, Medicare, Medicaid, or the individual market satisfies the requirement.","status",NA,NA,26,340,10,2,1,0,5,101

For the past seven years, we have seen overdose rates skyrocket across the country. When Obamacare lifted the caps on the amount of money insurance companies are required to pay for substance abuse treatment, it opened the door to bad actors seeking to take advantage of individuals suffering from drug abuse. This is unacceptable. As we work to repeal and replace Obamacare with a health care system that works, we're focused on addressing this problem and protecting some of the most vulnerable people in our communities.   ""'Before Obamacare, a typical policy would be $80,000 for addiction therapy,' Woods said. “Detox alone cost about $30,000, so responsible sober home operators were careful to portion out the benefits. Well, when the Affordable Care Act came in, that took away the maximums.”  ""Unscrupulous owners soon realized that urine testing was a particularly lucrative way to run up insurance payments. Sober homes and their affiliated laboratories can charge anywhere from $1,500 to $5,000 per screening, depending on the sophistication of the analysis and the number of drugs tested for. Some sober homes, which typically house six to 12 people, test the residents every single day. The Palm Beach Post discovered a 23-year-old man from out-of-state whose parents received a bill for nine months of drug testing totaling over $300,000.""","link","http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/04/the-heroin-crisis-in-trumps-backyard-215328","politico.com",10,27,4,0,0,4,0,1
