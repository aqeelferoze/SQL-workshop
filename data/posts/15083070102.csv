It is clear that Obamacare is not working.  That is why I voted against the bill that created it in 2010, and have continuously voted to repeal it. Now in 2017, for reasons I cannot understand, instead of moving a bill to repeal Obamacare and replace it with reforms that will fix our broken health care system, the Washington Republican leadership tried to jam a bill through the House that does neither.  Furthermore, the rushed, behind-closed-doors process they’ve used is shameful.  Seven years ago, Speaker Nancy Pelosi infamously said of the Obamacare bill: ‘You have to pass the bill so we can find out what’s in it.’ Sadly, the Washington Republican leadership is repeating the same mistakes.    As a result, members and the public were still learning about the consequences of this bill, major portions of which were amended just the morning of the scheduled vote. But what they did know about it, they didn't like.  Over the past three weeks, over 1,000 Eastern North Carolinians of all political stripes contacted my office.  Well over 90 percent were opposed to the bill.  I asked for this job to represent the people of Eastern North Carolina, and they have spoken clearly.  Furthermore, there are many aspects of the bill that deeply troubled me because of their potential effects on Eastern North Carolina and rural America.  For example, the bill discriminates against as many as 7 million American veterans by making them ineligible to receive tax credits provided in the bill.  It would also result in low-to-middle income seniors paying dramatically higher premiums.  For instance, a 64-year old making $26,500 a year would see their annual premium jump from $1,700 to $14,600.  It’s time to scrap this flawed bill and start over.  Go out across the country, gather people’s input, and use an open, public process to thoughtfully craft a bill that delivers the relief the American people need.","status",NA,NA,543,200,128,38,0,3,4,12

In a word, it’s frightening.  The federal debt is now $20 trillion and growing rapidly. The CBO outlined further risk going forward:   “Large and growing federal debt over the coming decades would hurt the economy (. . .) The amount of debt that is projected would (. . .) increase the government’s interest costs, putting more pressure on the rest of the budget; limit lawmakers’ ability to respond to unforeseen events; and increase the likelihood of a fiscal crisis, an occurrence in which investors become unwilling to finance a government’s borrowing unless they are compensated with very high interest rates.”    This is why I’m so opposed to wasteful spending, especially overseas.  Borrowing billions from the Chinese and Russians, to then give to Afghanistan and other countries that hate us, is just stupid.

It is clear that Obamacare is not working.  That is why I voted against the bill that created it in 2010, and have continuously voted to repeal it. Now in 2017, for reasons I cannot understand, instead of moving a bill to repeal Obamacare and replace it with reforms that will fix our broken health care system, the Washington Republican leadership jammed a bill through the House that does neither.  Furthermore, the rushed, behind-closed-doors process they’ve used is shameful.  Over the past several weeks, they cut deal after deal to secure members’ support, and then pushed the bill to the floor without a CBO score.  As a result, no one has any idea how much those deals will cost the American taxpayers, or how they might affect the cost, quality and availability of health insurance coverage for American families.  Seven years ago, Speaker Nancy Pelosi infamously said of the Obamacare bill: ‘You have to pass the bill so we can find out what’s in it.’ Sadly, the Washington Republican leadership is repeating the same mistakes.    Furthermore, there are many aspects of the bill that deeply trouble me because of their potential effects on Eastern North Carolina and rural America.  For example, the bill discriminates against as many as 7 million American veterans by making them ineligible to receive tax credits provided in the bill.  It would also result in low-to-middle income seniors paying dramatically higher premiums.  Over the past two months, thousands of Eastern North Carolinians of all political stripes have contacted my office about the AHCA. Well over 90 percent are opposed to the bill.  I asked for this job to represent the people of Eastern North Carolina, and they have spoken clearly.","status",NA,NA,1367,564,540,126,1,7,14,60

This is very troubling and very dangerous. The debt limit is a critical tool that Congress can use to check future increases in deficit spending and the national debt.  Doing away with it will only enable the big spenders in Washington and hasten America’s bankruptcy.   That is why this week I introduced H. Res. 564, which reaffirms the importance of retaining the federal debt limit.  H.Res. 564 states that “removing limitations on the debt would – (A) inappropriately cede Congress’ constitutional authority; (B) remove a critical check on future increases in deficit spending and the national debt; and (C) potentially exacerbate the already unsustainable fiscal position of the United States, and as a consequence, its national security.

America’s in a massive fiscal hole, but Congress keeps digging faster. This is not a conservative or responsible budget. It proposes to increase, not decrease, federal spending each and every year for the next ten years, from $3.13 trillion this year, to over $3.9 trillion in 2027. For the next ten years it would keep spending $162 billion through the off-budget, deficit-financed Overseas Contingency Operation account, which is the primary vehicle for the ongoing waste, fraud and abuse of American taxpayers’ money in Afghanistan.  When we’re already $20 trillion in debt and running $666 billion annual deficits, we can’t afford to keep doing this.  https://jones.house.gov/press-release/jones-continues-stand-against-runaway-debt","link","https://jones.house.gov/press-release/jones-continues-stand-against-runaway-debt","jones.house.gov",278,116,44,30,1,2,3,22

This legislation would close the ‘90/10 loophole’ that continues to allow for-profit colleges to aggressively target veterans and servicemembers while wasting billions of dollars in taxpayer funds.  Our veterans sacrifice so much and put their lives on the line to defend this country. For-profit educational institutions that take advantage of our veterans and Defense Department education funds are guilty of a double wrong: robbing veterans of a chance at a true education, and taking advantage of taxpayers.  It's time to close the loophole.  https://jones.house.gov/press-release/jones-works-protect-veterans-predatory-profit-colleges","link","https://jones.house.gov/press-release/jones-works-protect-veterans-predatory-profit-colleges","jones.house.gov",40,29,3,2,0,0,0,0

North Topsail Beach has provided extensive documentation to show that in 1982, the area was already under development, thus making the area eligible to access the NFIP.

Unfortunately, the tax bill voted on this week will be financed not by cutting spending elsewhere in the budget, but by adding $2 trillion to America’s debt.  Much of that will be borrowed from potential foreign adversaries like China, and then put on the backs of American taxpayers.  That’s an additional $20,000 debt burden on every household in America.  With federal debt already at $20 trillion, and deficit spending adding $666 billion to that debt just this past year alone, this is the wrong way to deliver the tax relief that the American people need.  For years, I have constantly sounded the alarm about the need to cut wasteful spending, balance the budget, and eliminate the massive debt that is bankrupting our nation.  This is not just an economic issue, it’s a national security issue.  Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Michael Mullen, has testified that the biggest threat to our national security is America’s rising debt.  Our current Secretary of Defense, Marine Corps General James Mattis, has affirmed that principle. When Admiral Mullen made his statement seven years ago, our debt was $13 trillion.  It is now 50% larger.  We’re going the wrong way fast, and unfortunately, this bill will quicken the pace.  I am also concerned that this bill will result in millions of middle class Americans, and thousands of Eastern North Carolinians, paying more in taxes, not less.  It is estimated that 5 percent of taxpayers will pay more tax in 2018, 9 percent in 2025, and 53 percent in 2027.  That is the last thing struggling families need.","status",NA,NA,458,403,157,52,4,12,11,79
