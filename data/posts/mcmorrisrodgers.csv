This is unacceptable, and this week, the People’s House took action. We passed the Midnight Rules Relief Act, which gives Congress the power to review and stop all major rules finalized 60 legislative days before Congress recessed. This means we have the ability to review every rule and regulation President Obama’s administration has issued since the middle of May. Currently under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can only stop regulations one at a time. This bill allows Congress to stop multiple regulations at once and faster respond to the regulatory onslaught from the administration. Americans were loud and clear on November 8: people are sick and tired of being governed from the top-down. President Obama has made life harder for Americans by passing burdensome regulations that increase the cost of living and interfere with everyday life. His regulations stifle innovation, hurt businesses, and especially for those in Eastern Washington, make farming difficult for American families. Executive overreach is not how America was founded, and the Midnight Rules Relief Act stops President Obama’s legacy of overregulation in its tracks.   http://www.wsj.com/articles/obamas-midnight-regulation-express-1482451192","link","http://www.wsj.com/articles/obamas-midnight-regulation-express-1482451192","wsj.com",223,121,62,27,1,7,3,21

You may be asking yourself, what does all of this talk about “rules and regulations” actually mean?  Well, for the local business owner or family, it means unnecessary, expensive, jobs-crushing mandates, and it’s a big reason why our economy isn’t doing as well as it could be.   This is why I’m so pleased to see House Republicans kicking off the year by undoing and reining in the most harmful aspects of President Obama’s legacy: burdensome rules and regulations.

Dan Newhouse, and Congressman Dave Reichert and I responded to Governor Inslee’s letter about the future of health care. We firmly believe that everyone, including individuals with pre-existing conditions, should have access to health care coverage. That coverage should protect the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship; provide choice because one-size does not fit all; and most importantly be affordable. While Americans that were previously uninsured may now have health care coverage, it means nothing if they cannot afford to use it – and the numbers show that today’s health insurance is woefully unaffordable.   Individuals and their families deserve health care reform that is done thoughtfully and responsibly with a smooth transition, and no one should have the rug pulled out from underneath them. Therefore, as we repeal the ACA we are also diligently working with local stakeholders, health care experts, Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, and the Administration to enact long-term, 21st century solutions that give people access to affordable, quality health care coverage focused on personalized, patient-centered care.

First, by spilling more water over the dams, less power will be generated, so Washington residents should expect to see their power bills increase. Secondly, the court ordered all maintenance on our dams to be halted while this year-long environmental study is undertaken, which only further delays the much-needed infrastructure updates to our dams. Thirdly, fish returns have been the highest they’ve been since the dams were built, and this court ruling neglects to take those numbers into account. Fourth, we already spill about 1/3rd of the water that passes through the dams, and increasing the amount is not scientifically based--and likely counterproductive--to fish returns.   There are groups actively advocating to tear down our dams, which I believe is very short-sighted and would cause more harm than good to the environment and to our economy.","link","http://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/local/article141154428.html","tri-cityherald.com",59,86,28,3,3,7,4,43

The recent terrorist bombings in Egypt against Coptic Christians reminds us that the Middle East is still torn by ancient hatreds and fears.  Here in America, the familiar story of the Exodus and the ritual meal where the tale is told is especially poignant, where the memory of slavery and anti-Semitism is still fresh. Today the American Jewish Community not only celebrate their ancient freedom, but the one they enjoy every day living in a country where religious freedom is enshrined in the Constitution.  This year has been marred by vandalism at Jewish cemeteries and bomb threats against Jewish community centers.  I co-sponsored bipartisan legislation called the “Combating Anti-Semitism Act,” to make such actions a federal hate crime. But laws alone will not solve the deep divisions in our country.  At a time when Jewish people are gathering for Passover, and Christians preparing for the Easter holiday, I pray we can together remember the verse from Exodus that urges us to treat people different than ourselves with kindness, since “you were once strangers in the land of Egypt.”  I hope that this year, as you enjoy time with family and friends, the biter memory of slavery and persecution will be mixed with the sweet feeling of liberty, knowing that you live in a free country and that Israel is once again the home of the Jewish people.","status",NA,NA,39,27,2,3,0,0,1,5

I call these programs “zombies” because they continue on with no end in sight. What’s an authorization? An authorization is the process under which Congress establishes or continues the operation of agencies and programs - and it's a vital part of our job. During the authorization process, Congress provides oversight over all programs, reviews them, rethinks them, or changes them. This is an important part of the legislative process, but it unfortunately has been neglected in recent years.   That’s why today, I introduced the Unauthorized Spending Accountability (USA) Act to make Congress do its job and properly review and rethink federal programs. My legislation targets unauthorized programs and puts them on a pathway to sunset in three years if they're not reauthorized.

This FDA regulation, which is set to take effect May 5, has an estimated compliance cost of nearly $1 billion — and that’s just for grocers. Coupled with the predicted 14.5 million hours of paperwork, this is one of the most expensive and onerous regulations of the entire Obama administration.  The FDA regulation puts strict, burdensome regulations on menu labeling in a way that really hits our small business owners hard. Now, don’t get me wrong: I support nutrition information being open and accessible, which is why I’ve introduced bipartisan legislation that still requires menu labeling but also allows for flexibility for restaurants and other retailers, like convenience stores, grocery stores, and pizza delivery stores, in how they provide nutritional information in a way that makes the most sense for their stores and customers. The graphic below shows how tough this regulation is: for a sandwich shop that offers 30 toppings, they’d have to print or write the nutrition information for around 30 million different combinations of sandwiches. Imagine how much paper that would take to print a menu that long! I think that nutrition information should be provided in a way that uses 21st century technology so that the cost to our small mom and pop shops and convenience stores doesn’t put them out of business. Imagine being forced to write 30 million different combinations of sandwiches on your chalkboard behind your counter! That’s time-consuming, burdensome, and for many, unachievable. That’s why my legislation brings back common sense to menu labeling.

As we prepare to vote on the American Health Care Act (AHCA) tomorrow, I want you to know that I'm a co-sponsor of the latest amendment, which dedicates $8 billion to reduce premiums and other out-of-pocket costs for patients in the individual market with pre-existing conditions. The AHCA would allow waivers to states if they meet very specific standards, including the standard that premiums for individuals living with pre-existing conditions must be stabilized, meaning premiums cannot be unaffordable. At no time is any insurance company permitted to deny access to coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. If a state applies for a waiver and you have a pre-existing condition and don’t have continuous health care coverage, the $8 billion fund helps lower premium costs. To me, protecting people with pre-existing conditions isn’t just good policy: it’s a personal mission.

This past year has been one filled with conflict and divisiveness at home and around the world. Yet, it has also been a time of hope, with Israel enjoying a tenuous peace with her neighbors and a new administration fervently devoted to defending the Jewish state.   I just returned last month from my third trip to Israel, leading a senior congressional delegation, meeting with the Prime Minister and defense officials. Each time I return, I am impressed anew with how the hard work and innovative genius of modern Israelis has turned the ancient Holy Land into a world leader in defense, software, agriculture, and medicine.   At a time when so many issues divide us, it is a hopeful sign that support for Israel continues to enjoy bipartisan support. Indeed, resolutions condemning Iranian aggressiveness have been adopted by almost unanimous votes.   Yet 5778 brings, as every new year does, new energy for us to meet the challenges in the year ahead.   As you know, it is a flavorful custom to eat apples dipped in honey to celebrate Rosh Hashanah. Since Washington state produces almost half the apples grown in the United States, I think we can see that in synagogues and homes across the nation, our fruit will be sweetening the lives of millions of Jewish families -- which is fitting, since Jewish culture and tradition has enriched the lives of all Americans for so long.  On Rosh Hashanah it is written and on Yom Kippur it is sealed. May it be written and may it be sealed that you have a new year that brings fulfillment and happiness, peace and prosperity - all of life’s very best things. Have a Happy, Healthy New Year! Shanah Tovah!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/mcmorrisrodgers/photos/a.405156824771.195673.321618789771/10155759775394772/?type=3",NA,109,29,7,16,2,0,2,1
