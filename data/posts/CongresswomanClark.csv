Unfortunately, instead of using his first 40 days to focus on measures that can make a real difference for families -- job creation, paid leave, equal pay, investments in education, development of clean energy, and repairing America’s crumbling roads and bridges -- Trump has focused on attacking health care, instilling fear in communities across the country, slashing environmental protections, and waging war with any media outlet that reports facts about his administration.   Every member of Congress has a responsibility to stand up for the families in our districts. It’s up to us to fight for an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthiest Americans, by fighting for investments in our workforce and investments in America’s leadership in the global economy.   For Congress to serve the families who sent us to Washington, Republicans must join Democrats in upholding the checks and balances provided by our constitution.    From attempts to bury his administration’s potentially illegal communications with Russia, to pushing an unconstitutional Muslim ban, to refusing to address his conflicts of interests, the President’s actions show that he has no intention to live up to his legal responsibility to our constitution or his moral responsibility to America’s families.   I call on my colleagues, regardless of party, to provide a necessary check on the worst impulses of the President, and I thank the millions of Americans at home who are holding this administration accountable even when this Republican Congress refuses to do so.","status",NA,NA,356,33,34,19,1,0,1,6

He lost both his parents at a young age, and his sister struggled with mental illness and spent her adult life institutionalized. With his two brothers fighting overseas in World War II, he was sent away to school and to make his way.   And that he did. My Dad was never bitter, but rather he loved his family and friends deeply and approached life with an open heart and a keen sense of humor. He never forgot that his success was rooted in those who helped him when he needed it. In turn, he was always quick to help with a bill, open his home, or offer a meal. He knew individual success is based in a strong community, and he was always there with his hand outstretched to others.
