We express gratitude to the Coast Guardsmen and women stationed around the world who go under appreciated every day. These men and women protect our borders daily from illicit activity by transnational criminal organizations like the Sinaloa Cartel, protect the marine environment, ensure a safe and efficient marine transportation system, create passage ways by breaking ice in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, conduct national defense missions around the world, and rescue countless lives in danger at sea. We will always stand by the Coast Guard in remaining ""Semper Paratus--Always Ready"" as it meets the nation's 21st century demands.","status",NA,NA,193,55,23,11,0,0,0,0
