Furthermore, California ranks 47th in the nation in Medi-Cal payments resulting in more physicians opting out of seeing Medi-Cal patients, making it even more difficult for those patients to get care. To put it in perspective, in our district alone there are regions with only one physician per 9000 residents, three times worse than the recommended standard. I wrote to Governor Brown urging to use Prop 56 funds as they were intended and not redirect them to the general fund. We should put the needs of patients first and fund the new Graduate Medical Education programs we need to adequately care for Californians and increase payments through Medi-Cal, so Medi-Cal patients don't have to struggle to see a physician. In fact, this is precisely how Californians indicated they want these funds used. This isn’t a political issue, this is about standing up for patients and providing for the health and well-being of all Californians.","link","http://www.pe.com/2017/05/02/why-raul-ruiz-is-concerned-about-jerry-browns-budget/","pe.com",307,26,50,19,0,6,4,1

Quote from the article: ""Joseph R. Swedish, the chief executive of Anthem — the nation’s second-largest health insurer — said on a conference call to review second-quarter earnings that the company is reassessing its participation in ACA marketplaces for next year. Anthem has decided to largely withdraw from the markets in three of the 14 states it participates in, and he said it may stop participating elsewhere unless the markets seem stable.  He cited, in particular, the question of whether Congress and the Trump administration will continue “cost-sharing subsidies” that the ACA provides insurers to help lower-income customers — about 7 million this year — afford deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses.  Noting that Anthem’s “2018 market footprint” for selling ACA health plans is not fully decided, Swedish said, “If we aren’t able to gain certainty on some of these items quickly, we do expect that we will need to revise our rate filings to further narrow our level of participation.”  https://apple.news/A01nDGMWhQbaylcbcYJC1ew","link","https://apple.news/A01nDGMWhQbaylcbcYJC1ew","apple.news",55,15,11,2,1,0,7,15

The plan gives tax cuts to the very wealthy while rationing care for the underserved. Middle class families will be forced to pay more out of pocket and get less coverage. This is unacceptable and I will fight against any proposal that would force seniors and working families to pay more money for less care. We need to focus on making medicine more affordable, decrease out of pocket costs, and address the physician shortage crises.","link","http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/house-republicans-obamacare-repeal-package-235343","politico.com",319,86,249,9,1,19,28,147
