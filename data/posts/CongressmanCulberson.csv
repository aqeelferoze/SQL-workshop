Do not return to evacuated areas until told it is safe to do so.   This is still a dangerous storm; residents and visitors in areas potentially affected by the severe weather should continue to monitor local radio or TV stations for updated emergency information. When it is safe to do so, check on your neighbors who may require assistance, such as infants, children, older adults, people with disabilities and others with access and functional needs. Individual community members are the first line of response following a storm.    If you evacuated and have not yet returned to your home, call your insurance company. To file a flood insurance claim under the National Flood Insurance Program, contact your insurance agent immediately. You can also call 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) – select option 2 – to learn more about your policy, and be directed to the appropriate claims resource.   While immediate lifesaving and life sustaining operations are the priority for FEMA and our partners, residents and business owners in designated counties who sustained disaster related damage due to Tropical Storm Harvey, and are able to do so, can apply for assistance by registering online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov.    You may wait to register for FEMA assistance until you know whether your home is damaged. You have 60 days after a declaration to register for FEMA disaster assistance.   Registering online is the quickest way to register for FEMA assistance since the event will last several days and the full scope of damages may not be evident until the storm has passed. If you do not have access to the internet you may register by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY). If you use 711 relay or Video Relay Service (VRS), call 800-621-3362 directly. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. (local time) seven days a week until further notice.    FEMA does not provide food assistance, including food lost due to power outages. Voluntary organizations in the disaster area may be able to help with your food needs. If you have a food-related need, dial 2-1-1 for a referral to an organization that can assist. Family and friends of those in the affected areas are urged to check social network sites like Facebook or Twitter for information about your loved ones, or use the American Red Cross’s Safe and Well program, to let family members know they are safe, or looking for loved ones. To report a missing child, contact the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) at 1-866-908-9570. Anyone who finds an unaccompanied child who may have been separated from their parents or caregivers should contact the local police, or enter basic information and/or a photo into the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children's Unaccompanied Minors Registry or call 1-866-908-9570.","link","http://www.disasterassistance.gov/","disasterassistance.gov",7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0

This is very important information.   Mayor Turner Issues Voluntary Evacuation Request for those who live SOUTH of I-10, WEST of Gessner, NORTH OF Briarforest, EAST of the reservoirs.   Today Mayor Turner issued a voluntary evacuation request. If you have any water inside your home, and if you live in an apartment or high rise if there is currently any water on the first floor, in an area bounded by I-10 on the north, Briar Forest on the south, Highway 6 on the west and Gessner on the east, you are asked to get out of your home and stay out for at least the next two weeks.   Given the current water releases from Barker and Addicks Reservoirs by the Army Corps of Engineers, and its intention to continue such releases at the current level, the situation on the ground is not anticipated to change for the next two weeks. The Army Corps intends to continue releases between 13,300 cfs and 16,000 cfs for at least the next two weeks.  If you have water in your home, it will be there for at least the next two weeks.  If you do not have water in your home, the Mayor and the Harris County Flood Control District said they currently do not anticipate that you will receive flood water and should be able to stay in your home.  If you do stay in your home, please continue to monitor weather conditions.   In issuing his request, the Mayor cited the risk of electrocution, structural compromise, water quality, and critters in the water (including gators, snakes and fire ants).  The Mayor acknowledged during his press conference that most of these homes had no flooding as the result of the intense rainfall we received, and were only flooded by the release of water from Addicks and Barker Reservoirs.  If you are in the voluntary evacuation area and need assistance, the City of Houston urges you to call 911.  The city will provide transportation to the NRG Park shelter for those in need of housing or residents can proceed there directly.  More information on the water levels in Addicks and Barker and the water inundation areas can be found here: https://www.hcfcd.org/flooding-floodplains/addicks-and-barker-reservoirs/  For current information on Buffalo Bayou, follow the link to "" Buffalo Bayou Inundation Scenarios, August 30, 2017.""","link","https://www.hcfcd.org/flooding-floodplains/addicks-and-barker-reservoirs/","hcfcd.org",7,7,20,0,0,0,3,1
