We hit the ground running Friday morning by joining AT&T in New Albany for the announcement that new Fiber internet is coming to Southern Indiana. From there, I went and toured a Home Depot and discussed how important it is to their business that their employees remain thoughtful, knowledgeable, and approachable to keep customers first. Next, I had the opportunity to join the White River Township Fire Department at their annual awards dinner where we recognized the Firefighter, EMT, Paramedic, Officer, and Employee of the Year.  The next work day took us to Bloomington where I had the chance to tour Baxter Pharmaceuticals and meet with so many people that help save lives daily (they told me that every second, one of their products is administered somewhere in the world)! We ran up the road a little ways and visited with Bybee Stone Co, Inc where we talked about how stone from the Hoosier State makes its way all across the globe for projects. Before calling it a day, I sat down with educators from the Cook Center for Entrepreneurship at Ivy Tech Community College where we discussed the challenges facing students and teachers.   The next day, I spent time in Bedford where I met with local pharmacists and discussed how some excessive government regulations have made necessary prescriptions too expensive for Hoosiers. I also had a chance to tour Best Home Furnishings and see some great AMERICAN craftsmen in action.   The following two days, I had an opportunity to meet with members of the Greater Greenwood Chamber of Commerce as well as One Southern Indiana Chamber & Economic Development where I took questions on a whole range of issues that impact businesses of all sizes including an overburdensome federal government and a mandated healthcare program that doesn't work for employers, employees, or providers.  Additionally, I had productive conversations with local elected officials where we discussed issues that are impacting Hoosiers on the most local level and what can be done to address them. I also had a chance to visit Central Nine Career Center where I saw firsthand how they provide robust, hands-on training to those students who are passionate about joining the Hoosier workforce.   Finally, the team at Caterpillar invited me to tour their facility and experience how they re-manufacture engines, empower their workforce by fostering a community, and see how their ""cobots"" help human workers complete tasks. I also had a great opportunity to speak with the Keeping Our Public Politically Informed (KOPPI) student group at Center Grove High School. These young minds are the future of not only our state but our nation and they asked some great questions about our government and how they can remain involved and informed.  On top of all of these visits throughout our community, I also continued my daily habit of calling at least 50 random constituents a day to hear directly from them how they feel their government is working as well as what issues are important to their families.   I continue to value every minute I get to spend at home speaking with fellow Hoosiers. That's why I am on the first possible flight home from Washington, D.C. and on the last possible flight back. I am honored to represent you in the House of Representatives.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepTrey/photos/a.193677404438995.1073741829.178051136001622/217847682021967/?type=3",NA,62,41,9,0,0,0,0,1

Following that, I participated in a legislative townhall in Brownstown with representatives from state and local governments that was hosted by the Brownstown Chamber of Commerce. I also had the opportunity to visit with local businesses in Clark County to see how they continue to find innovative ways to serve the community. Last week, I was fortunate to be invited to address the attendees of a national security symposium at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division; a military installation here in Indiana that is of extreme importance. Afterwards, I met with representatives with Citizens' Climate Lobby Indiana in Bloomington. I also had the chance to tour Seven Oaks Classical School where I saw students of all ages actively engaged in their learning process. I even had a chance to read a book to some kindergarteners.
