The country is asking, Mr. President, what do you have to hide?  There is no question that President Trump wants the investigation of Russian interference with the 2016 Presidential election, and the Trump team’s ties to those efforts, to just go away.  Knowing this, it is hard to interpret the decision to fire Director Comey as being motivated by anything other than a desire to shut down or derail the FBI’s investigation. In fact, it only raises further suspicions about the Trump team’s ties to Russian interference in our election.  For months, I have called for a special prosecutor and an independent investigation into this serious matter.

What is new here is the women.  We are, all of us, speaking out, naming names and demanding that the harassers take responsibility for their behavior.  I am proud of each of the women who has come forward, and heartened by the changing climate that has received their stories with acceptance and compassion.  My hope is that this moment for a cultural change will result in women no longer being viewed as objects or toys, but recognized for their abilities and achievements. As regular human beings. Women have endured this behavior, which for too long has been ignored and tolerated. But no longer.  We can only create a culture where women are respected as equals if we all step forward and be part of the change by holding everyone, especially our leaders, accountable.","status",NA,NA,471,588,56,60,4,6,52,126

EDIT: My full remarks in opposition to Senator Sessions' nomination follow:  I’ve served with Jeff Sessions throughout my time in the Senate and respect him as a colleague.   But I have deep concerns about how Senator Sessions would use his prosecutorial discretion as Attorney General to address a number of critical issues.   During his confirmation hearing, I pressed Senator Sessions for a commitment to vigorously protect every citizen’s right to vote, particularly with regard to Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act – which safeguards Americans from discriminatory voting laws.   He did not give me a satisfactory answer that he would scrutinize voting laws for discriminatory effect.   I also asked Senator Sessions whether he would honor the Department of Justice’s consent decrees that address police misconduct and enhance accountability.   Senator Sessions did not adequately assure me that his Department would uphold these agreements without revisiting or renegotiating these agreements. I pressed Senator Sessions for a commitment to defend Roe v. Wade in federal court and to enforce laws that guarantee the constitutionally-protected right to choose.    Senator Sessions did not disavow his past comments that Roe v. Wade was one of the worst Supreme Court cases ever decided.  Should the Supreme Court be presented with a case that provides them the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade, I asked him what he would direct his Solicitor General to do. He said this was hypothetical and didn’t respond.  Over the past two months, I’ve heard from hundreds of my constituents and a number of prominent civil rights organizations – including a number who testified yesterday – on this issue.   I will vote against the nomination of Jeff Sessions to serve as Attorney General because I am deeply concerned about how he would use his prosecutorial discretion to uphold voting rights, protect civil rights, and protect a woman’s right to choose.","status",NA,NA,38,13,3,5,0,1,0,0
