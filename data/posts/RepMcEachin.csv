It has been exciting, humbling, busy, and confusing. Even as I learn to navigate the halls and tunnels, I am constantly so humbled by the confidence you all have placed in me. Every time I have voted this week (and I haven't missed a single vote!), I have first thought of what my constituents want and what could best improve their lives.   We don't yet have committee assignments - I am eager to serve on committees and get into the details of policy - but, nonetheless, I have already learned so much. I speak to colleagues on both sides of the aisle and, every day, visitors come from the district and throughout Virginia. I really relish those visits to keep me tied to the folks and the issues back home.   I made a commitment to be back in the district every weekend to stay in touch and to be out helping constituents. I'm afraid the weather today has put a bit of a damper on those plans! But you can expect to see me throughout the district over the next weeks and months whenever my official duties allow me to come back home. We are working hard to get our district offices open as soon as possible and I will be sharing that contact information with all of you. We are here to help when we can!  So,at the end of a first whirlwind week, with lots of important votes already and more on the horizon, let me thank you again and reiterate my promise that I am here in Congress to serve you and to make our Congressional District, our Commonwealth and our country even better.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo9975JZfaI","status",NA,NA,9,4,0,0,0,0,0,0

This piece of legislation is another blatant attack on women’s health care and their access to family planning resources. Just yesterday, President Trump signed the unfair Global Gag Executive Order which will prevent global access to women’s healthcare, and now this. This Administration, and some of my colleagues in this Congress, want to do whatever they can to hinder women from receiving the healthcare they need.    This past weekend, women all over this country marched and made their priorities clear. Now, with those scenes of incredible crowds still fresh, it is not our place to make choices for millions of women who need access to the many forms of family planning that is available. Women across this great country told us this past weekend exactly what they want.

I oppose any measure that threatens the quality of our drinking water. Clean drinking water is a fundamental public health need. Harming that basic need is one of our most basic responsibilities as legislators. We must not put special interests ahead of our constituents’ health. We have seen, in Flint, Michigan and elsewhere, the painful consequences when people lack access to safe drinking water. We must do more to prevent that kind of suffering. Nixing this rule would instead mean that we were doing less.   The Stream Protection Rule is the product of a careful, years-long process. This rule was crafted in the sunshine, but Republicans want to overrule it in what seems like the dead of night. After all the work that went into ensuring the best for Americans, this resolution of disapproval did not even receive a committee hearing. The Stream Protection Rule is very simple. It strengthens and clarifies existing water quality protections with respect to mining. It requires that affected streams be restored when mining is finished. It gives communities accurate information about water quality, so they can best protect themselves from pollution. This protective measure should not be reversed.","video","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8vwwuzD0wY&t=2s",NA,79,16,4,10,0,0,2,0

Moreover, journalists are not made to write accolades about leadership, whether they agree or not.  In our country, laws and the Constitution are supreme, not one person. Surely, the president should recognize this when just this week his immoral ban was overturned by the courts. The courts rule on our Constitution, not one leader. And when his unconstitutional executive order was struck down, the government, the officers in airports were forced to obey and did.  In our country, lawyers, advocates and citizens are free to challenge the government and its leadership without fear of reprisals.  In our country, hundreds of thousands of citizens can take to the streets to express their disgust and dismay with the president and know that, because of our Constitution, their freedom of speech and assembly are protected.  I would strongly recommend that President Trump spend some time, perhaps instead of engaging in his obsession with Twitter, to study our system of government and to learn that we are a nation of laws, not one subject to the whims and murderous impulses of a singular leader.  In his dealings with the world, I would ask President Trump to remember that we have been a beacon of democracy, freedom and hope for people all around the globe and that he stops squandering that reputation with his idle comments and dangerous actions.","status",NA,NA,151,14,23,53,0,0,0,0

My serious concerns about the appointment of Attorney General Sessions continue to mount. He comes to Richmond for a press event, saying he wants to address violent crime here. But by not inviting the Commonwealth’s Secretary of Public Safety or Attorney General Herring, Sessions proved that he does not actually care about keeping our communities safe. Instead of meeting with all relevant law enforcement experts and officials — instead of consulting with them about the circumstances here in Virginia — it appears that the Attorney General is on a partisan mission to deliver talking points that are not based on facts. Mr. Sessions would have had a better-informed meeting if he had invited the state-level officials he chose to exclude.  Partisan and racial blemishes on Sessions’ background give me serious concerns when we think about the safety and security of Virginians. Individuals have a legal right to be considered innocent until proven guilty, no matter their race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or socioeconomic status. I have serious questions about whether Sessions will be able to impartially guide the Justice Department in sensitive areas like violent crime and poor policing.

Now Congress gets to make actual decisions. The President’s fiscal year 2018 budget demonstrates clearly how much this Administration does not care about hardworking families.   The programs and funding that middle class, minority and low income communities rely on most were stripped or not adequately funded in the President’s budget. Hardworking families in urban, suburban and rural communities will suffer if we fail to protect public education, housing, and the social safety net. If this budget were signed into law, it would place more fiscal burden on those who can least afford it, that is, our most vulnerable communities. History has shown that when America’s richest receive more tax breaks at the expense of everyone else, our country suffers.   While I support dedicating needed resources to help our brave men and women in the military, those funds should not come at the expense of critical, basic and needed programs.  Debilitating cuts in climate change and alternative energy programs as well as the elimination of Chesapeake Bay federal funding are unacceptable.  These cuts endanger public health now and for future generations. The Chesapeake Bay is a source of jobs, transportation, income, food, and recreation for countless Virginians. We have finally made some gains with the Bay, but this budget will reverse our gains.   It appears that this budget will simply make America’s richest even richer, while middle class and low income Americans will find themselves struggling even more to try to make ends meet. Congress is responsible for enacting the budget. I call on my colleagues to reject these draconian cuts and urge that we work together to create a budget that actually works for all Americans – not the select few. This is not the budget that will make America great again.","link","https://mceachin.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-mceachin-president-trump-s-fy2018-proposed-budget","mceachin.house.gov",47,16,6,2,0,1,0,0

House Republicans pulled this bill because their own members knew passing such a catastrophic policy would have been unhealthy.  The powerful opposition that TrumpCare sparked across party lines sends a clear message to the Administration and Republican leadership: Americans need and demand access to quality, affordable health care. The Affordable Care Act brought the uninsurance rate to an all-time low, and it has greatly slowed growth in the cost of care. Democrats and Republicans should be working together to build on the progress we’ve made — not casting it aside to benefit wealthy donors and special interests.  Forcing 24 million people off of their health insurance would have been un-American. Without essential health benefits, insurers could have made coverage bare-bones, dramatically limiting crucial benefits or dropping them entirely. People with pre-existing conditions would not have been able to purchase plans that covered the benefits they need. The list of harms from the AHCA goes on and on.  My constituents made their fears and concerns over this bill clear to me.

Maggie Walker was the first female bank president of any race to charter a bank in the United States. Her life story is one of sheer determination and unwavering dedication to bettering the lives of African Americans and women.   Born Maggie Lena Mitchell on July 15, 1864 in Richmond, Virginia, Mrs. Walker lived on College Alley off Broad Street and attended Richmond Public Schools. As a young adult, Walker taught grade school for three years until marrying Armstead Walker Jr. After marriage, Walker left the teaching profession and worked for the Independent Order of St. Luke. Mrs. Walker initially joined a local chapter of this fraternal burial society at the age of fourteen. Established in Baltimore, Maryland in 1867, the society administered to the sick and elderly, promoting humanitarian causes and personal accountability. Mrs. Walker served in various positions, culminating in her service as the Right Worthy Grand Secretary in 1899 until her death.   In 1902, Walker created the publication “The St. Luke Herald” and soon after, chartered the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank. She would go on to serve as chairman of the board of directors following the merger of St. Luke Penny Savings Bank with two other area banks, resulting in the creation of The Consolidated Bank and Trust Company. Mrs. Walker was awarded an honorary master’s degree from Virginia Union University in 1925 and posthumously inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2001. Mrs. Walker died in 1934. Her Richmond home was converted to a National Park and continues to educate the community about her life-long service and dedication to our community. #HiddenFiguresVA04 #WomensHistoryMonth","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepMcEachin/photos/a.1829601337316199.1073741827.1829532087323124/1871028236506842/?type=3",NA,42,1,2,6,0,0,0,0

It is unacceptable to have a gender wage gap more than 50 years after the Equal Pay Act was signed into law. This wage gap directly impacts hardworking families and their children because many women are the sole source of income for their family. The wage gap has broad ramifications and must be part of a united effort for all aspects of women’s rights which includes paid leave, workplace discrimination rights, and access to affordable health care.   Unfortunately, the gender wage gap is more drastic within communities of color. Black women, Latina women, and Native American women lose thousands in earnings over their lifetimes compared to white men. Women and their families cannot afford this disparity to continue. It is beyond time to close the wage gap. If we act now, future generations will see wage inequality as archaic as it is.  In Virginia, women working full-time are paid an average of 78 cents for every dollar paid to men. African American women make a mere 59 cents and Latina women only 52 cents for every dollar a white man makes. I introduced a bill to ensure that Virginia women receive equal pay for equal work in the General Assembly because I was dedicated to advocating for women’s rights at the state level, and I will not waver in my determination at the federal level. This #EqualPayDay, I proudly stand with my colleagues in this fight for gender equity by cosponsoring the Equal Pay Day Resolution, the Paycheck Fairness Act, and the Global HER Act.

Scientific facts provide us with the tools we need to create an ever-better world, to protect natural resources, to promote public health, and to preserve our environment – among many other positive outcomes.  Those who deny science, deny the progress humanity made over thousands of years. Science has allowed us to harness resources and brain power to improve lives. Science and facts provide a road map for correcting mistakes and building on our progress.  I am proud to stand in solidarity with the March for Science today because to stand against science is to deny facts and progress at the expense of humanity and a limitless future.

The only thing perhaps more absurd than firing a man he and Attorney General Sessions just recently termed 'gutsy' is the reason the president gave. He cited Mr. Comey's handling of the investigation into Ms. Clinton’s emails, the same emails about which Director Comey’s October pronouncements are considered by some to have cost her the election, the same election that Mr. Trump won while praising Mr. Comey.   Now, six months later, when, frankly, the emails matter not at all, and the subject has turned to the president’s potential transgressions, Mr. Trump removes the person doing the investigating while citing as the cause Comey’s treatment of the president’s vanquished rival.   You can’t make this stuff up, but what I do know is that we must have an independent investigation. Russia’s actions were a direct attack on our democracy, an unprecedented and completely unacceptable effort to shape our politics.

During my time as a Member of the Virginia General Assembly, I fought hard for equal rights for all and I continue that fight in Congress.

Today’s vote is a step backwards, towards a vastly more volatile and dangerous financial system that would threaten Virginians’ and all Americans’ economic security.

Now, my Republican colleagues want to re-create the kind of anything-goes financial system that caused those harms in the first place. This bill would undermine consumer protections for seniors, service members, and millions of Americans saving for their retirement. It would undercut financial regulators’ ability to police threats to the financial system — solely to help the select few. These changes are unacceptable and wrong.  Instead of repealing vital protections, we need to take further steps to ensure that Wall Street greed does not endanger families’ livelihood, savings, or quality of life.

But Senate Republicans didn’t stop there: the Senate Trumpcare bill is especially disastrous for Americans on Medicaid, particularly individuals with disabilities, vulnerable children and pregnant women, families living paycheck to paycheck, and middle class seniors with long-term healthcare needs.    This bill — crafted without public input, bipartisan collaboration, or compromise — could cause millions of hardworking Americans to lead shorter and sicker lives, solely to provide the wealthiest Americans with tax cuts. We need to write legislation that protects all Americans, not to benefit the select few.

Justice delayed is justice denied. Families are living in dangerous, dirty, completely unacceptable conditions. In the face of such clear suffering, public officials have a responsibility to act — none more so than officials at HUD. The agency has not responded to documented problems with the force or the swiftness that affected families deserve. Allowing this situation to arise in the first place, and to persist for years on end, has been a waste for taxpayers and an injustice for residents.  Once again, my letter calls for a plan to close Essex Village and provide residents with housing vouchers. It again seeks concrete improvements that would help residents in the meantime, including a policy change to allow Henrico County's own inspectors to accompany those sent by HUD. And in the event that HUD believes such changes are not possible, it demands that they explain why – and requests constructive alternatives that would meaningfully improve conditions.

Thanks to updated technology, scientists discovered that the reservoir behind the Conowingo Dam will cease to effectively trap sediment 15 years sooner than previously estimated. Virginia and neighboring states have invested significant sums to support the Bay’s cleanup efforts because a clean and healthy Bay is critical to our economy, public health, and quality of life. If we fail to address this problem, that progress will be undone — at a terrible cost to our fisheries, tourism and recreation, and countless other industries that depend on the Bay.    The federal government must remain committed to a clean Bay. That means continuing to adequately fund existing cleanup efforts, and it means devoting new resources and setting more aggressive goals in the face of unexpected challenges like the silt-up at Conowingo. The states that share ownership of the treasured Bay need a willing, proactive, and adequately-resourced federal partner. Though this news is discouraging, our existing Chesapeake Bay cleanup efforts have already shown that progress is possible. For us here in Virginia and in the 4th Congressional District, a healthy Chesapeake Bay keeps our families and economy strong. I will continue to champion funding and programming that will lead to a cleaner, safer, and healthier Bay now and in the future.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/a-dam-could-derail-the-chesapeake-bay-cleanup/2017/07/04/cd2b4d46-5c1f-11e7-a9f6-7c3296387341_story.html?utm_term=.48970a9fa898","washingtonpost.com",13,5,9,0,0,1,4,0

The Trump Administration regularly abuses the powers granted by the Constitution by supporting an agenda of hate, bigotry, and xenophobia. This ban on transgender individuals serving in the military is the latest in a long list of actions that hurt anyone who isn’t born a white, heterosexual man. In eight months, Mr. Trump and his administration have rolled back decades of progress on issues of equality, justice, civil rights, and countless other priorities.  Together with Representatives Kennedy and Jayapal, joined by dozens of our colleagues, I will send a letter next week that urges the president to reconsider his ban on transgender individuals serving in the armed forces. Mr. Trump has used hate, not facts, to justify this baseless, un-American ban. A study commissioned by the Department of Defense confirmed that medical costs for transgender servicemembers would be negligible. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis has said the Department of Defense should ‘measure each policy decision against one critical standard: will the decision affect the readiness and lethality of the force?’  Based on that standard, there is no rational basis to prevent transgender Americans from serving.   Instead of working to be a Commander-in-Chief who ensures America has the best qualified armed forces, Mr. Trump has chosen instead to attack a group of service members who have done nothing but be ready to make the ultimate sacrifice to serve and protect their country.","status",NA,NA,278,87,23,28,3,0,10,27

Implicitly, the ban denies the value of transgender servicemembers, and it questions the professionalism of those who serve beside them. Our Armed Forces have grown more equal and more inclusive over time, often in the face of strident opposition. In 1948, when President Truman moved to racially integrate the military, voices were raised in protest. They were raised again in 2010, when Congress at last repealed ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.’ At every turn, those voices have been proven wrong.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepMcEachin/photos/a.1829601337316199.1073741827.1829532087323124/1952654215010910/?type=3",NA,126,22,4,29,0,1,1,4

All Americans deserve reliable access to safe, sanitary, affordable housing. It is clear that residents of Essex Village do not enjoy such access, and it seems increasingly clear that the current owners / operators cannot or will not provide that access within a remotely fair or decent time-frame.  Previously, I have encouraged HUD to terminate their relationship with the current owners/ operators of Essex Village. I wrote his most recent letter after receiving a copy of the demand for corrective action that HUD sent to those owners in the wake of an August inspection. HUD’s demand letter states that while “the total possible points attributed to units is 44.26, the final score reflects the property only received 22.12 points.” As a result of that poor score, HUD writes, conditions in at least some units still pose “a serious risk to the health and safety of tenants.”  Seemingly, HUD has determined there is more wrong than right with units at Essex Village. Nothing is more important to a family’s health and safety than conditions in that family’s actual home. I am not aware of any system under which a score of less than fifty percent constitutes a passing grade, and I cannot imagine that conditions posing ‘a serious risk to the health and safety of tenants’ could exist in a community that has met even the most minimal legal standards of quality.  I am dismayed to see businesses making millions off the American taxpayer even as they fail to deliver the most basic services — services they are contractually obligated to provide, and to which the families they serve have a fundamental right. This kind of waste is deeply wrong, and it directly harms the people I was elected to represent. I will not be silent in the face of such outrages.  As I have said before, I believe that the clearest and simplest solution is to end the current owners’ /operators’ involvement at Essex Village as quickly as responsibly possible.","status",NA,NA,25,4,0,0,0,0,0,0

President Trump used Attorney General Jeff Sessions to inform Americans that the program ""is being rescinded"" to ""limit"" the number of immigrants we accept into our country. Study after study has demonstrated that DACA recipients go to school, work good jobs and contribute back –  in tax dollars and brain power – to our country and our economy. Instead of appreciating their contributions, this administration has once again demonstrated their narrow, bigoted view of what makes this country great.  The policy announced today only serves to undermine young people who have done nothing to deserve forced separation from their friends, family, and community. Against the advice of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, President Trump is proceeding with terminating this program. One cannot help but wonder if this President's real motivation is to undo this program because it began under President Obama’s leadership.  Let's do what we know is right – allow these young people to remain here, in the country they call home, to earn an honest living, to attend school, and to pursue the American Dream.

He speaks bombastically of his ability to destroy far off North Korea, but then claimed that he cannot get better aid to Puerto Rico because we are separated by an ocean.  This morning, rather than acknowledge that Puerto Ricans are in dire need and that, ever day on our tv screens, we are seeing scenes of horrific devastation and suffering, he attacks the mayor in personal terms and accuses her of partisan politics. Mr. President, when it comes to needless partisan attacks as a diversion, look in the mirror.  As the President careens from complimenting himself and his administration on their response to Puerto Rico to bombastic insults directed at San Juan’s mayor, Mayor Yulin Cruz continues to make every effort to help her community recover.

This is not what the United States of America is all about.   They will not intimidate us. Instead, their torches and their chants ensure that we will rededicate ourselves to fighting hate, to coming together, to standing for American ideas of tolerance and inclusion.

Administrator Scott Pruitt and the Trump Administration’s decision to reverse the Clean Power Plan was probably made during Mr. Pruitt’s many meetings with industry and corporate executives and lobbyists –  average Americans, without corporate connections, will suffer the most after this unfortunate decision.   An administration that actually cared about upholding the EPA’s mission would not reverse a lifesaving plan that prioritizes public’s health and a sustainable future. The Clean Power Plan was written to limit the carbon pollution emitted into the air that we breathe. The Clean Power Plan assisted with our nation’s transition to clean energy dependence and green jobs, the path toward a cleaner future.   This reversal puts Americans at risk in more than one way, and I urge Mr. Pruitt to reconsider.","link","https://mceachin.house.gov/media/press-releases/mceachin-statement-clean-power-plan-reversal","mceachin.house.gov",35,10,3,0,1,1,0,2

Transgender individuals are already bravely serving our country and do not deserve this discriminatory action. If there is ""proof"" then show it, so we can evaluate that. If there is no proof then the President lied to the American people once again.

This executive order is yet another attack on Americans’ access to quality, affordable health care – especially those with pre-existing conditions. By again attempting to sabotage ACA marketplaces ahead of Open Enrollment season, the Trump administration is intentionally playing dangerous political games with Americans’ health.  This order will force many Americans to make do with bare-bones plans that fail to cover necessary health benefits like maternity and newborn care, prescription drugs, and mental health services and addiction treatment. In addition to receiving less and poorer-quality care, those folks will also face higher deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses when they have an illness or an accident. The rug will be pulled out from under them when they most need it.  By moving younger, healthier workers to bare-bones coverage, this order will also worsen risk pools in the individual market, driving up premiums for those who continue to receive coverage through an exchange.  This administration has already cut outreach and enrollment funding for the ACA; it has denied insurers the stability they need to operate, thus driving up premiums; and it intends to close Healthcare.gov repeatedly during enrollment. Today’s legally questionable order offers yet another proof-point: He is determined to dismantle the ACA and sabotage the entire healthcare system to score cheap political points and simply declare a victory.","status",NA,NA,27,34,8,0,0,1,17,32

The bill provides for a well-deserved 2.4 percent pay increase for our servicemembers. This bill will shore up our alliances, deter Russian aggression, and strengthen our efforts to combat terrorism. It requires our military to plan for threats posed by climate change proactively, makes real progress towards a larger and more robust Navy, and maintains important ‘Buy America’ standards that support well-paying jobs. I am pleased that this bill also excludes proposed harmful provisions and discriminatory language that would have targeted transgender servicemembers.  Throughout the NDAA process, I fought for language that would benefit not just our country, but residents of the 4th Congressional District. I am pleased to see that much of the language was included in either the final bill or reports, including requirements that the military actively plan for climate change and sea level rise, language that moves us towards a more muscular Navy, provisions that will help ensure modernization of our public shipyards, and efforts to support appropriate Air Force training range consolidation.
