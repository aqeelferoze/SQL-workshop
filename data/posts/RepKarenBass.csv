During his 4-year tenure, the CFPB has brought nearly a dozen enforcement actions against financial service providers that overcharged or restricted access for minority borrowers, which has led to nearly $30 million in civil monetary penalties and over $400 million in restitution for approximately 1.4 million affected minority consumers. I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle and the incoming administration to acknowledge these qualifications and to work with the CFPB to continue to protect the finances of millions of Americans.   http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/314906-cbc-to-trump-keep-richard-cordray-ensure-the-protection-of","link","http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/314906-cbc-to-trump-keep-richard-cordray-ensure-the-protection-of","thehill.com",37,2,3,0,0,0,0,0

I wholeheartedly condemn this move and this administration’s misguided effort to round up undocumented immigrants, while cutting federal grants to sanctuary cities like those in L.A. County.   We are a nation of immigrants composed of hardworking families, students, and people who wake up every morning and go to work to make an honest dollar. Trump is deliberately targeting the most vulnerable members of our society, including children and families fleeing violence, who we should be protecting.   Sanctuary cities are implemented to encourage immigrants without legal status to cooperate with police and reduce crime. Trump’s executive order will upend this established trust and effectively turn police officers into ICE agents, resulting in more instances of unreported crime due to the fear of police interaction. This, in turn, encourages criminals to take advantage of this fear, and transforms undocumented immigrants into easy targets.","link","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-idUSKBN1591HP","reuters.com",114,27,28,7,0,1,6,28

A myopic military approach fails to not only address the root causes that impact long-term stability on the continent, it also misses real opportunities for investment and partnership. The time has more than come for the Trump administration to advise Congress and the American people of its proposed strategy in the region.  A coherent policy toward Africa cannot be ad hoc or emerge in response to isolated events on the ground. Defense alone, without diplomacy and development, is a losing foreign policy proposition. We must pursue a congressional investigation into what happened in Niger while calling on the administration to establish a robust and clear U.S.-Africa strategy to enhance the possibility of peace.

The light Robert Guillaume brought into a room was as impenetrable as the light that shined down on him on stage. He was a fighter; someone who carried himself by his own weight from the inner city of St. Louis to the bright lights of Hollywood. A trailblazer for black actors and actresses throughout the country, Robert’s contributions to beating back racial prejudice on stages across the country cannot be overstated. In 1985, he became the first black actor to win an Emmy for lead actor in a comedy series for his role in Benson, a feat that has unfortunately remained nearly insurmountable. Just this year, Donald Glover became only the second black actor to win the award.    Always dedicated and inspired by his craft, Robert continued to challenge his limits, a truly inspirational journey to witness. I’ll forever remember his performance as the first black actor to sing the title role of ""Phantom of the Opera,"" appearing with an all-white cast, leaving jaws dropped and audiences remarking “We had no idea Benson could sing, let alone sing opera!”   But sing he did, and sing he shall. His endearing essence and comforting spirit will be so missed. We could all afford to live by his words:  ""To assuage bitterness requires more than human effort. Relief comes from a source we cannot see but can only feel. I am content to call that source love.""  Robert, may you rest now, without pain or worry, wrapped in the love you hold dear.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepKarenBass/photos/a.192730957419720.55596.190867440939405/2112710322088431/?type=3",NA,109,16,16,23,0,0,70,0
