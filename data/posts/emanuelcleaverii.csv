This dangerous bill would take away private health insurance coverage from millions of women and undermine a woman’s ability to make personal decisions about her own health. This action comes just days after millions of women marched nationwide to protect their rights and over 10,000 Kansas Citians gathered in support. The bill  would take away the tax credits women are entitled to in order to help buy insurance and would make the Hyde Amendment and other federal abortion bans permanent. This legislation does not allow any exceptions for women to get the coverage they need when their health is in danger, even in circumstances where a woman needs an abortion to prevent severe, permanent damage to her health  The  Affordable Care Act set out rules to ensure federal financial assistance is not used to pay for abortion services, except in the case  of rape, incest and life endangerment. Thanks to the ACA providing better access to birth control and family planning services, the U.S. abortion rate is at its lowest level on record. The abortion rate dropped 14 percent between 2011 and 2014.  H.R. 7 would take away a women’s ability to make an extremely personal medical decision.

Climate Change is an existential threat, not only to the United States, but the planet as a whole. It is not only an environmental concern, but an economic, defense, national security, and immigration issue as well. Pulling out of the Paris Accord leaves the potential for serious backlash, and increases the likelihood that our nation will be drawn into foreign conflicts over scarce resources and refugees. While the rest of the world moves towards a clean energy economy, the United States will now be put at an economic disadvantage, trying to play catch-up while the rest of the world innovates and invests in clean energy. With virtual consensus among scientists, the backing of close to 200 nations, and the support of major economic/business leaders, President Trump's decision to pull out of this international agreement--in order to keep an empty promise to Big Oil and Big Coal--is absolutely indefensible. While President Trump has taken the United States a step back as a global leader, I will continue to fight for a safer, cleaner and more sustainable environmental agenda. https://goo.gl/TD5waQ","link","https://goo.gl/TD5waQ","goo.gl",870,135,210,22,9,9,139,106

In recognition of the centennial of America's entrance into WWI and in a show of solidarity from Emmanuel Macron, the US Army 1st Infantry Division--the first US unit to enter France in 1917-- was invited to lead the #BastilleDay parade amongst the French armed forces. We were lucky enough to host the 1st Infantry Division in Kansas City earlier this year for the WWI Centennial Commemoration and I'm pleased to see them continue to get the recognition they deserve. Being a major WWI advocate, I want to personally thank President Macron for honoring the efforts of the American armed forces during the Great War.

Suicide is the second leading cause of death for individuals aged 15-34 and 3rd leading cause of death for kids aged 10-14, according to the CDC. It is the tenth leading cause of death overall in the United States with almost twice as many people dying by suicide than from homicide. This is truly an epidemic. Young Americans are dying unnecessarily every day and I feel an honest obligation to do something about it.

I want to give a special thank you to The Jason Foundation, Inc. -Youth Suicide Prevention and Awareness, an organization that has worked tirelessly to advance awareness of youth suicide and work with state legislatures to give schools the help they need in dealing with this growing dilemma.

I, along with Rep. Luke Messer, have introduced H.R. 4119, The Student Loan Disclosure Modernization Act, a bipartisan bill that will simplify the Department of Education's ""Plain Language Disclosure Form."" Currently, 44 million Americans owe more than $1.3 trillion in student loan debt, many of whom don't fully understand the loan obligations. My bill would help to simplify what is presently a confusing standardized form so that students have a more complete understanding of the loan options available to them and how the loans will affect them in the future. It is my hope that every American who wants to improve their circumstances through higher education has the opportunity to do so without unnecessary financial burdens, and that begins with clearly and simply education these students before they take out a loan.

Instead of spending so much time on tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations, our first priority should have been fully funding the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Community Health Centers without taking funding away from other programs that help families and children with vaccinations, substance abuse and youth suicide prevention. CHIP is widely used in Missouri and covers the healthcare of 13,000 children in my district and 9 million children nationwide.  This CR should have also protected our Dreamers. Passing the DREAM Act is of major importance to help those children and families facing deportation from the only home they've ever known.    It is my hope that when Congress reconvenes in 2018 we can come together and find some bipartisan solutions to these pressing issues.","status",NA,NA,346,89,30,43,7,2,3,14
