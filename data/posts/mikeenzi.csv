But the Christmas season is not just about the gifts we receive. It is a time to count our blessings, give thanks for our good fortune and take an extra moment to appreciate the loved ones who are so dear to us. For everyone celebrating, Diana and I wish you a very Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season! Remember to celebrate and be thankful for the blessings of the year and look forward to a bright new year.","video","https://www.facebook.com/mikeenzi/videos/10155926411389437/",NA,177,68,9,23,0,2,1,13
