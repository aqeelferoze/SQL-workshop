I’m honored to continue to serve the fine citizens of the 7th District and look forward to building upon the successes of the 114th Congress and working with President-elect Trump to Make America Great Again by repealing repeal Obamacare and the many other rules and regulations harming our economy and job creation, as well as serving as a voice for our military, our veterans, farm families, and coastal communities.   One of the first actions I took this Congress was co-sponsoring a patient-centered Obamacare replacement measure.  In addition to fully repealing Obamacare, the American Health Care Reform Act of 2017 provides more choices and control for individuals by: -expanding the use of health savings accounts; -allowing state portability; -enabling small businesses and individuals to band together through new pooling mechanisms; -improving access for vulnerable Americans by expanding federal support for high-risk pools; -protecting those with pre-existing conditions by allowing them to move between health insurance markets while maintaining continuous coverage; -encouraging the practice of evidence-based medicine to prevent increased healthcare costs and the medical liability crises; and, -preventing federal dollars from being used for abortions.   While we work towards repealing Obamacare, it is important to know that Republicans have solutions to provide a transition for those who will be impacted by the reforms.  The American Health Care Reform Act of 2017 is a great first step towards replacing Obamacare with a patient-centered system that allows for increased access to more affordable and higher quality care.    With my support, the House passed H.R. 26 – the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act” - which requires Congressional approval for any executive rules with an economic impact of over $100 million.  Often times the executive branch pushes regulations with major implications to millions of Americans without the consent of Congress.  This bill will reinstitute the necessary protections against unchecked authority to prevent harmful regulations from becoming law.   In addition to passing the REINS Act, I joined my colleagues to pass H.R. 21 – the Midnight Rules Relief Act – to prevent last-minute regulations and executive orders from being hastily passed in an Administration’s final months.  President Obama’s far-reaching and aggressive rules made into law over the last few months undermine the will of the American people and incoming Trump Administration.    Lastly, the House voted to condemn the UN’s anti-Israel resolution.  We cannot turn against and blindside our closest ally. I have always been and will continue to support Israel and her citizens.  Come January 20th, America will stand with Israel once again.","status",NA,NA,16,20,4,0,0,0,0,5

David Rouzer","2017-01-13","2017-01-13 21:41:57","ROUZER ROUND-UP:  House Republicans are committed to providing regulatory relief for individuals, families and businesses.  Under the Obama Administration, Americans have struggled to keep up and comply with the ever increasing list of red tape coming out of Washington.  This week, with my support, the House passed numerous bills to remove the barriers standing between economic growth and job creation, including:   --H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act which increases the transparency in the rule-making process, provides for the  American public to have more input and requires government agencies to choose the least costly option; --H.R. 79, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups (HALOS) Act which deregulates the investing process for start-ups and allows new businesses to solicit potential investors without breaking securities laws; and, --H.R. 238, the Commodity End-User Relief Act which reauthorizes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to better protect those who use the futures market, provide end-users with market certainty, and make basic reforms to ensure transparency and accountability at the Commission — all of which will help farmers, ranchers, and end-users manage risks and help keep consumer costs low.   Lastly, both the House and Senate took the first step to dismantling Obamacare by adopting a budget resolution, which opens the door for the actual legislative vehicle known as “Budget Reconciliation"" that can be used to repeal the vast majority of Obamacare.  This is a very convoluted and confusing process, but the bottom line is the Budget Act of 1974 set up a legislative vehicle that is privileged and designed only for legislation that directly affects revenues and expenditures.  In this case, “privileged” means that it requires 51 votes rather than the usual 60 votes to end debate on all other legislation.    The catch is only items that the Senate parliamentary views as passing the “Byrd Rule” can be included in reconciliation.   (As further background, there are 100 members in the Senate and all legislation must garner 60 votes in order to pass that chamber.  There are 52 Republicans in the Senate, which means you must have 8 Democrats willing to cross party lines and vote with all 52 Republicans — assuming, of course, that all 52 Republicans are in lock-step.)    The budget resolution includes what are called “reconciliation instructions"" that guide the respective congressional committees with jurisdiction over healthcare as they develop the Budget Reconciliation legislation to repeal Obamacare and replace it with patient-centered solutions.   With passage of a Budget Resolution that includes these reconciliation instructions, work will begin in earnest to repeal as much of Obamacare as possible as allowed under the “Byrd Rule” while also including provisions that begin to create an environment that will enable doctors to have more control and enhance their ability to provide quality care, and provide more competition, transparency and portability in the insurance marketplace.    It is also important to point out that the next secretary of Health & Human Services has wide latitude under the law to craft rules that will provide for a much smoother transition from Obamacare to any reform measures that Congress passes and the President signs into law.","status",NA,NA,14,14,4,0,0,0,0,1

I agree with every word of President Trump’s statement yesterday, which clarifies the scope and intentions behind these temporary policy changes.”   The full statement President Trump released yesterday is below:   “America is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border. America has always been the land of the free and home of the brave. We will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say. My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror. To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion — this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order. We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days. I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria. My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as President I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.”","link","http://www.wsj.com/articles/what-does-president-trumps-travel-ban-do-1485717429","wsj.com",137,87,33,17,0,0,0,22

David Rouzer","2017-02-03","2017-02-03 17:38:52","We have received numerous phone calls, emails and other correspondence on President Trump's temporary travel ban.  I take every opinion very seriously.  As with any change in immigration policy, feelings are wide ranging and varied — as well as highly emotional on all sides.  There are several important facts that are helpful to know in order to understand the intent behind the President’s Executive Order, which is policy reflective of legislation the House of Representative passed during the 114th Congress.  I share these points because I believe them to be important components necessary to know for the public discussion on this issue.     First, the seven countries impacted by the temporary travel ban are command central for recruitment and training by radical Islamic terrorists, and these specific countries were deemed to be of special concern by this past Congress and White House pursuant to the Visa Waiver Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015, signed into law by President Obama.     Second, the Executive Order does not contain a ban on Muslim immigration — every individual, regardless of religion, is affected.  For example, Christian Syrians are being denied entry into the United States as well under this temporary travel ban.  Further, there are many countries that are majority Muslim for which this temporary travel ban does not apply.    Third, this temporary ban provides the United States government time to take an inventory of the security measures that we, and other countries have in place, so that adjustments can be made to enhance our security by keeping those who intend to harm from entering our country.  Once this evaluation is done and any improvements necessary are implemented, the travel ban will be lifted.","status",NA,NA,61,73,23,8,0,2,0,14

David Rouzer","2017-02-03","2017-02-03 19:56:35","ROUZER ROUND-UP:  This week, the House of Representatives took action to get rid of some of the most harmful regulations pushed through by the Obama Administration in the final days of the presidency, including:  -the Department of Interior’s stream protection rule.  Reverses a rule estimated to destroy one-third of our nation’s coal mining jobs and put up to 64% of our country’s coal reserves off limits. -the Bureau of Land Management’s venting and flaring rule.  The intended purpose is to regulate emissions from production on federal lands; however, industry is already subject to Clean Air Act standards through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  This duplicative and costly rule has made it impossible for producers to develop resources on federal lands – reducing tens of thousands of jobs and forcing smaller operations in the oil and natural gas industry to shut down. -the SEC’s Resource Extraction rule.  This rule targets publically-traded American energy companies by requiring those engaged in commercial development of natural gas, minerals or oil to disclose proprietary information that can be used by their global competitors.  The SEC estimates this rule will add roughly $1 billion in costs to the energy industry.  -the Social Security Administration NICS rule.  This rule infringes on the Second Amendment rights of disabled Americans attempting to purchase firearms when they have a designated payee for their benefits.  This rule is estimated to impact nearly 4.2 million, law-abiding Americans wishing to exercise their Second Amendment rights.   Federal rules and regulations are estimated to cost American citizens and businesses nearly $2 trillion per year.  While there is still much more work to be done, I will continue to focus my efforts on repealing the onerous rules and regulations harming job creation.    With a president willing to sign these bills into law, we will work to drain the Washington bureaucracy by changing the regulatory structure and targeting specific rules to repeal.  I’m pleased to join my colleagues this week in reversing regulations estimated to destroy tens of thousands of jobs, put American businesses at a severe competitive disadvantage and violate our constitutionally protected liberties.","status",NA,NA,28,30,4,1,0,0,0,6

As a Congress, it is our obligation to ensure our military has the necessary funding to provide for our defense and combat the most immediate dangers to our homeland.  H.R. 1301 provides a pay raise for our military personnel, supports readiness programs and ensures our troops have the resources and technology necessary to support its missions.   I also had the opportunity to testify in front of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture to discuss agriculture priorities as it relates to the FY18 budget.  Many farmers, ranchers and producers across rural America are facing significant challenges.  I will continue to work to reduce costly rules and regulations while serving as a voice for all farm families across our nation.   Lastly, House GOP leadership released the American Health Care Act -- a bill to repeal Obamacare and reform our health care system.  This repeal and replacement bill is a work in progress that will be modified multiple times before passing the House and the Senate.  Included in this bill are components to repeal Obamacare’s individual and employer mandates, provisions that send taxpayer dollars to abortion providers and the Obamacare subsidy system.  There are also many important provisions the #AHCA will continue to provide such as ensuring coverage for pre-existing conditions, allowing young adults to remain on their parents insurance to age 26, preventing insurance companies from charging women more than men, maintaining a ban on lifetime or annual limits and keeping the Medicare Part D donut hole closed.    It’s important to note that this budget reconciliation bill is the first of three steps to achieving a replacement with the goal of creating more competition and greater access to quality health care.  Under this step-by-step approach, the first step is to pass the American Health Care Act to repeal the mandates, taxes and spending under Obamacare.  The second step is for the Administration, specifically Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, to deregulate the marketplace in order to stabilize it, increase choices and lower costs.  The last step in this three-phase plan is to rebuild the health care system by passing conservative-minded bills to allow shopping across state lines, medical liability reform and more.  I remain cautiously optimistic that Congress will ultimately come together and pass a reconciliation bill that promotes employment and fiscal restraint.","status",NA,NA,24,28,3,2,0,0,1,11

With my support, the House passed the VA Accountability First Act, Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act and a bill to allow the Secretary of the VA to hire physicians and other employees.  The VA Accountability First Act of 2017 seeks to create a culture of accountability at the VA by providing the Secretary of the VA the flexibility to remove, demote or suspend any VA employee based off of poor performance or misconduct.  The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act ensures no veteran or beneficiary is declared “mentally defective” simply because someone at the VA appoints someone to assist with the management of the veteran’s finances.  Under this bill, veterans would only be considered “mentally defective” if a court ruled that the veteran or beneficiary is a danger to themselves or to others.  Lastly, the House passed a bill to establish a recruiting database to allow for quality potential employees to be aware of position openings at the Veterans Administration.  Additionally, this bill would create opportunities for career training and advancement for current employees.   I also re-introduced my bill to return taxpayer dollars used to fund the federal education bureaucracy back to the respective states in order to increase teacher salaries or to be used for any other purpose that a respective state chooses to enhance education.         The States’ Education Reclamation Act of 2017 (H.R. 1510) proposes a responsible dismantling of the Department of Education by reallocating its billions in funding to be proportionally distributed to the respective states to be used for any education purpose as they see fit, such as teacher pay raises, new school construction, investment in technology and more.  Taxpayer dollars provided to the Department of Education from each state would be returned to the states in the form of grants.     The Department of Education was created in the early 1980s with the intention of reversing stagnating education performance amongst Americans.  Since 1980, the Department’s budget has ballooned from $14 billion to approximately $87 billion while failing to vastly improve students’ performance in math, science and reading.  Meanwhile, the Department expends large amounts of money on its own maintenance and overhead – paying its general services employees an average of $109,924 per year.  In comparison, teachers in North Carolina take home an average salary of $47,931.    My bill is critical in increasing teaching pay and returning funding and decisions back to the states and school administrators.","status",NA,NA,18,22,1,0,0,0,1,4

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has acted as our nation’s privacy regulator for the online world since the creation of the internet.  However, one year ago, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) acted to strip the FTC of that role; instead, the FCC attempted to take control by enforcing flawed privacy rules that harmed competition, created confusion and failed to provide citizens with promised privacy protections.  I do not believe the federal government should further regulate the internet which is why I supported S.J. Res 34.

With my support, we passed two bipartisan bills to officially designate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism and formally condemn its continued development of its intercontinental ballistic missile program.  The House advanced the Self-Insurance Protection Act to ensure workers and employers continue to have access to affordable, flexible health plans through self-insurance.  This bill reaffirms the long-standing policy that stop-loss insurance is not health insurance, protects access to affordable healthcare coverage by preserving self-insurance, and prevents bureaucratic overreach.  We also passed the bipartisan Supporting America’s Innovators Act to remove onerous regulations and instead replace them with a regulatory framework that will encourage innovative forms of capital encouraging small business growth and job creation.  Lastly, the House acted to eliminate the sunset date for a veterans program, the Veterans Choice Program.  When the Choice Act, which created the Veterans Choice Program, was passed, language declared that the program would expire on August 7, 2017.  Since there are still funds remaining for the program, Congress acted to eliminate this sunset date so that veterans would still have access to healthcare services under this program. In the meantime, I will continue working to address short falls of Veterans Choice for the duration of the program.   #NC07","status",NA,NA,15,6,1,0,0,0,0,3

No president has done more so early in their administration to protect the moral and spiritual principles upon which this country was founded, nor has any president done more by this point of time in office for the working men and women who make America great.  To date there is no evidence of any collusion between the President or his campaign with the Russians, and I do not expect that to change.  Congress has an obligation to provide oversight of the executive branch on all matters, and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees take their responsibility seriously to follow the facts wherever they may lead.  I have every confidence that the newly appointed special counsel will do the same.","status",NA,NA,483,397,97,64,29,5,8,136

Below is a bullet point summary of what is known so far and actions that are underway.   -The NC DEQ, in consultation with the state Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), is leading a state investigation regarding reports of an unregulated chemical, known as GenX, in the Cape Fear River.  -The GenX found in the river is likely the byproduct of a vinyl ether process that has been taking place for 37 years.    -The last sample was taken in 2014 showing a presence of GenX.  -NC DEQ is strongly encouraging Chemours, the company that produces the chemical at its facility in Fayetteville, to identify any measures that can be taken to reduce or eliminate the discharge of GenX until the state completes its investigation.    -A Chemours official told state environmental regulators this week that the company is working to assess waste streams containing GenX and determine whether the company can reduce the amount of GenX discharged to the river.  -NC DEQ will begin collecting water samples from the Cape Fear River as early as next week to get better data.   -The first test results will likely be available four weeks after samples are received at a lab facility in Colorado, which is capable of detecting GenX in water at low concentrations.  Multiple rounds of testing and analysis will be necessary for a meaningful evaluation of the water quality.  -Chemours has agreed to pay for this testing.  -The EPA is working to establish guidance on unregulated compounds, such as GenX, that North Carolina and other states can use to develop potential regulations for these types of compounds.   -DHHS has initiated daily conference calls with local health departments in the lower Cape Fear region in order to share up-to-date information.","status",NA,NA,42,55,28,0,2,1,3,16

David Rouzer","2017-07-14","2017-07-14 20:30:49","ROUZER ROUND-UP:  This week, with my support, the House of Representatives passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2018, which increased authorized funding levels for the military in order to better equip our men and women in uniform so we can improve our military readiness and capabilities.     Since the Sequester cuts started several years ago, our military has just been getting by – enduring annual cuts to funding as our world becomes a much more dangerous place.  We have asked our men and women who serve to do more with less and because of this, tough readiness choices have had to be made.      The House of Representatives took action on Friday to address this readiness crisis by increasing defense spending to $696.1 billion — a 10 percent increase over last year’s spending level.  This boost in spending will help to better ensure that our service members have the tools necessary to complete their missions safely and efficiently while working to protect our vital interests in the world as well as combating terrorism both at home and abroad.    The FY18 NDAA strengthens our national security by: -Providing for U.S. involvement and support for efforts in strategic regions around the world; -Fulfilling the request of the Army, Navy and Air Force with thousands of additional personnel; -Increasing missile defense funding by $2.5 billion; -Modernizing our nuclear weapons stockpile, missile defense, and military vehicles; -Supporting defensive and offensive cyberspace strategy; and, -Ensuring that no terrorist detainees at Guantanamo Bay are transferred to American soil.  The NDAA provides for our troops and their families by: -Fully funding a well-deserved pay increase; -Blocking misguided attempt to close military medical facilities upon which our deployed troops and their families rely; and, -Providing commonsense resources to help families manage challenges like relocations – including reimbursements for spouse’s obtaining licensing/certification in another state.   Lastly, the authorization bill reforms the way the Pentagon does business by: -Updating the retirement system, improving the military healthcare system and streamlining our military acquisition system so that the Department of Defense conducts business in a more cost-effective and transparent manner.   The funding levels authorized in FY18 NDAA are critical to maintaining and strengthening our operations abroad, as well as at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, Fort Bragg, Camp Lejeune, and all the other installations across our country.  We owe it to the service members and military families of Southeastern North Carolina to pass this vital authorization of funding so that we can defeat terrorism, combat the growing security threats we face and keep our homeland safe. #FY18NDAA","status",NA,NA,58,43,6,8,0,0,0,13

Under the current GI Bill, veterans are obligated to use their education benefits within 15 years from the end of their service.    The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (H.R. 3218) modifies the program to ensure that service members will be able to use their education benefits throughout their lifetime.  The bill would also simplify the benefit for future service members by consolidating the GI Bill into a single program over time, which would help to reduce the VA's administrative costs.  In addition, the legislation provides increases in funding for Reservists and Guardsmen, dependents, surviving spouses and dependents.  It also restores eligibility for service members whose school closes in the middle of the semester and creates a pilot program that would pay for veterans to take certain high technology courses.    H.R. 3218 is critical to expanding veterans' access to education and workforce training and will help ease the transition from active duty to civilian life.  I look forward to continuing to build on our work to ensure our veterans and their families get the care and support they deserve.","status",NA,NA,30,14,0,0,1,0,0,0

No question about that. I was saddened to see what took place in Charlottesville. But those organizations -- your white supremacists, neo-nazis, any other group out there such as the KKK -- they have no place in American society. They have to be condemned in the most forceful way possible.""  The congressman also weighed in on President Trump's remarks, with his initial statement that condemned violence on many sides, while not specifically condemning the groups Rouzer mentioned.  ""Knowing the president the way I do, and I've talked to him several times, there's no doubt in my mind that he is absolutely 100 percent committed to the American people and loves this country very very much. I also know he rejects any form of racism or any form of hatred as well.

Cooper said. ""Wherever you live in North Carolina – from the mountains to the piedmont to the coast – you need to take this storm seriously, and you need to start preparing for some type of impact.”   Gov. Cooper said the State of Emergency will go into effect at 8 a.m. on Thursday, September 7 in order to facilitate the movement of any resources that may be needed to respond to the storm. It also waives truck weight, size and hours of service restrictions so that vehicles carrying essential supplies such as food, medicine, fuel or transporting livestock or crops can get their jobs done quickly.   While much uncertainty still exists about Hurricane Irma’s storm track, meteorologists are predicting that portions of the state could experience wind and rain from the tropical system as early as Monday.    “Our emergency response teams are seasoned and ready. They have been tested repeatedly over the past year and our colleagues are ready to respond as called,” Public Safety Secretary Erik Hooks said. “But we cannot weather this storm alone. This is a tremendous storm. We need residents and visitors to ensure they are ready: check your emergency plans, restock your emergency kits, and pay close attention in the coming days to the weather forecast.”    The state’s Emergency Management team began coordinating storm preparations over the Labor Day weekend with county partners, state agencies and South Carolina, Virginia and officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. They have requested a FEMA incident management team to expedite any federal assets that may be needed to respond to the storm.   State transportation officials also have placed crews on standby, been preparing their equipment and checking culverts to remove debris that may clog drainage pipes.   Follow N.C.

That's why, House Republicans are working to replace the outdated tax code with a system that is more simple, affordable and competitive.  #taxreform","link","http://freebeacon.com/issues/new-poll-finds-bipartisan-consensus-among-voters-on-need-for-tax-reform/print/","freebeacon.com",52,58,5,3,1,0,0,15

This bill also directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to address gaps in its protection of VA employees to increase accountability across the agency.   As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I participated in a subcommittee hearing on the importance of long term, stable funding for our nation’s infrastructure projects.  I also testified in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to share with the Committee how the 7th District has been impacted by the opioid epidemic.  As many know, the opioid crisis is a growing and significant challenge for all aspects of our communities – parents, law enforcement agencies, schools, healthcare and treatment facilities, and more.  This epidemic is so rampant, in fact, that it would not be a stretch to say that if a family doesn’t have a relative suffering from this addiction, they know a friend or family who does.  As the representative of the 7th District, I will continue to shed light on this issue and work with the best and brightest in our region who are bringing solutions forward that will enable our country to turn the tables on this growing epidemic.   Lastly, the House of Representatives continues its work on achieving real, fundamental tax reform.  Our framework is focused on growing the economy, supporting middle-class families, bringing jobs back from overseas, and putting America first.  In order to accomplish that, we’re taking the 10% bracket and making it zero.  We will then lower rates above it so that every American, at every income level, will be able to keep more of what they earn.  We’re also seeking to double the standard deduction and increase the Child Tax Credit.  Under our plan, income levels at which the Child Tax Credit begins to phase out will be increased to make the credit available to more middle-income families.  Lastly, we’re proposing a 40% tax cut on local businesses to facilitate growth and end incentives to ship jobs, capital and tax revenue overseas.  These reforms are critical to lowering taxes, growing our economy, increasing jobs, encouraging small business and achieving prosperity for all.

Some of the national security-related bills passed were aimed to hold Iran and North Korea accountable for its involvement in fueling terror and human rights violations.  The Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act (H.R. 1698) requires a comprehensive investigation in order to identify and sanction companies, banks and individuals – both inside and outside Iran – involved in the regime’s missile program.  The Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act (H.R. 3329) further ramps up pressure to sanction regimes that provide weapons to Hezbollah, as well as target Hezbollah’s fundraising and recruiting efforts. H.Res. 359 urges the European Union to designate Hezbollah in its entirety as a terrorist organization.  Additionally, the Otto Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions Act (H.R. 3898) holds the North Korean regime accountable by imposing the harshest set of financial sanctions on the regime to date.  It’s no secret the North Korean and Iranian regimes pose great threats to our peace and security.  The bills the House passed last week are vital to preventing further conflict, terror and turmoil throughout the regions and beyond.   The House also took action to curb dangerous, synthetic opioids (like fentanyl) from crossing our borders.

The study would seek to provide a better understanding of the suffering many veterans endure from mental illnesses and other high-risk behaviors so that our medical professionals can better treat those who are suffering from the invisible wounds of war.  -The Veteran Urgent Access to Mental Health Care Act (H.R. 918) – This bill would require the VA to provide an initial mental health assessment and any subsequent services required to meet urgent mental healthcare needs to former service members who would otherwise be ineligible for such services because they were discharged from military service under ""other-than-honorable"" (OTH) conditions.    -The Veterans Transplant Coverage Act (H.R. 1133) – This bill would amend the Veterans Choice program to authorize the VA to provide all care and services needed for a veteran to receive an organ transplant from a live donor, regardless of whether the donor is eligible for VA healthcare.  (Under current practice, a transplant can only occur if the donor is also a veteran.)   -The Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support Act (H.R. 2123) – This bill would give the VA Secretary the authority to allow VA providers to practice telemedicine across state lines.  This will expand the ability of veterans to access quality healthcare, particularly those in rural areas, who do not live in proximity to a VA facility.  -The Veterans Increased Choice for Transplanted Organs and Recovery (H.R. 2601) – This bill would enable veterans who aren't able to access care at a VA transplant center to seek care at a community transplant facility.  -The Securing Electronic Records for Veterans Ease (H.R. 3634) – This bill would make basic allowance for housing (VAH) documentation to be made available online to all veterans taking advantage of the GI Bill to help confirm a veteran's monthly housing stipend and simplify the home or apartment rental process.  -The Veteran Apprenticeship & Labor Opportunity Reform (H.R. 3949) – The bill would simplify the GI Bill approval process for private employers wishing to hire veterans by allowing companies to register their apprenticeship programs with one central approval agency, instead of registering separately with each state approval agency.  This bill will encourage a more diverse range of companies to place veterans into apprenticeships.  -The Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act (H.R. 3705) – This bill would require the VA to use certified mail to send debt notices to veterans and to use “plain language” to clearly explain why the debt is owed and what options are available to the veteran.  -The VA Management Alignment Act (H.R. 1066) – This bill would require the VA to submit a report to Congress on the VA’s organizational structure.  In order for the Veteran Health Administration to effectively serve our nation's heroes, it must improve its internal management and organizational structure and function.  This bill would hold the VHA accountable to improve the care our veterans receive.  It is an honor to represent the fine veterans, and their families, of the 7th District.  As your representative in Congress, I will continue to support vital measures for our veterans.","status",NA,NA,38,27,1,0,0,0,0,6

Once differences in the two bills have been reconciled, a final version of the bill will be drafted and then be sent to the House and Senate to be voted on.  If passed, the bill would then be sent to President Trump to be signed into law.  I also voted for a short-term funding bill that will fund the government through December 22nd.   Lastly, I voted for the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 (H.R. 38) to allow individuals who are permitted to carry a concealed handgun in one state to carry in other states that allow concealed carry.  I have been – and will always remain – an advocate for 2nd amendment rights.  H.R. 38 ensures that law-abiding individuals’ right to carry will not disappear once they cross state lines as well as strengthens criminal background check systems to ensure that firearms are kept out of the hands of criminals.","status",NA,NA,90,98,8,9,0,2,3,49

Over the next few days I'll be posting a summary of the questions asked and concerns shared.  If you would like to sign up to be placed on our list for future telephone townhalls, please visit my website at rouzer.house.gov.  Q:  Deborah from Four Oaks asked how our tax reform package would affect small farm families:  A:     North Carolina is blessed to be one of the most agriculturally diverse states in the country.  Unfortunately, North Carolina farm families have been facing many challenges during the past half-decade.  According to the USDA, farm income has fallen by 50% during the past 6 years.       The tax cut and reform package helps farm families of all sizes by lowering personal income taxes; allowing for 100% expensing of farm equipment and other investments in each of the first five years; and would put in place a new, lower tax rate for pass-through income, such as S-corps, LLCs and partnerships.  (The details of the latter are still being worked out.  The whole purpose is to ensure that pass-through entities, which most family farms and small businesses are, pay a much lower rate than the very high marginal income tax rate that they do today.)          The 100% expensing provision would be a huge boost for farmers and small businesses.  This will dramatically drive up investments that will help spur jobs and increase economic activity.  As an example, if a farmer bought a new tractor, combine or any other piece of equipment, they would be able to deduct 100% of that cost from their taxes in each year of such purchase up through 2022.         Finally, the House version repeals the estate tax permanently.  The Senate version significantly increases the exemption.  Either one of those provisions is a major improvement over current law that would benefit farm families and small businesses significantly.  Death should not be a taxable event.  It is essentially government theft to take a farm or other business property from a family after the death of a loved one.   #nc07 #agriculture #ag","status",NA,NA,30,51,1,1,3,0,0,15

Unfortunately, a large portion of Southeastern North Carolina was impacted by the devastation as a result of Matthew – many of whom are still struggling to fully recover.  Approximately half a billion dollars has been appropriated for Hurricane Matthew relief.

It is the job of Congress and the executive branch (the White House, Department of Defense & the Veterans Administration in particular) to ensure that our veterans have access to the best care possible.  That’s why I introduced a bill to revise the Veterans Choice Program and bring it into the 21st century by digitizing the claims submittal system to expedite the amount of time it takes for veterans to receive care and ensure more timely payment to outside providers.  This bill is currently being considered by the Committee on Veterans Affairs.

Fulfilling and strengthening our infrastructure needs are vital to Southeastern North Carolina.  As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I am heavily involved in these efforts.       Early in the new year, the President and his administration will be proposing a infrastructure package and working closely with those of us in Congress to pass legislation aimed at reducing the regulatory and permitting burden, developing new revenue streams to pay for projects nationwide and addressing the country’s infrastructure backlog.        The money transferred from the NC Highway Trust Fund to fund other general government needs is a state issue – not a federal one.  It is true that for years dating back to the 1990s, and perhaps even before, the state legislature would raid the NC Highway Trust Fund to fund other government services and projects.  Several years ago, that practice was discontinued and the legislature, to its credit, has been transferring General Fund dollars back to the Trust Fund to buttress that account and begin returning some of those dollars taken from it during previous years.","status",NA,NA,15,19,0,0,2,0,0,10
