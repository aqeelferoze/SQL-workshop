Survivors of the defense of Wake Island and their families have held annual reunions and other get togethers for the last nearly 71 years. Many of these gatherings have been organized by Alice Ingham, whose husband was on Wake Island. The last worker from Idaho, Joe Goicoechea, passed away this past year and the last reunion will be held this September. I've introduced legislation with Senator Joe Manchin (WV) to create a new Congressional Gold Medal in honor and memory of those who fought in defense of Guam, Wake Island and the Philippine Archipelago, and who died or were imprisoned in related efforts.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/mikecrapo/photos/a.10151582026417267.1073741828.80335332266/10154840006937267/?type=3",NA,62,24,6,10,0,0,0,0
