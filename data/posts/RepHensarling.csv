Under President Obama’s ""signature accomplishment"" premiums and deductibles have soared, patient choice has dwindled, and insurance markets have begun to collapse.  Despite promises that people who wanted to keep their insurance plan and doctor could do so, many Americans have lost one or even both.  Beyond Obamacare’s impact on their health care, hardworking Americans who were already struggling to make ends meet had their hours cut at work because their employer couldn’t afford Obamacare’s onerous taxes and penalties.  Republicans have a better way, and thanks to a special process known as reconciliation – which prevents a minority of the Senate from being able to block legislation through filibuster –we can get Obamacare repeal on President Trump’s desk and focus on reforming our broken health care system.  We can make patient care more affordable, portable, and accessible, while increasing competition and decreasing cost.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress and the new Administration to put individual people and families, not Washington bureaucrats, back in charge of their own health care.","status",NA,NA,69,41,9,3,0,0,2,8

Nevertheless, I was proud to stand with President Trump and Speaker Ryan today in our efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare.

But, help is on the way.   Republicans have a blueprint to make things right for the American people by reforming and streamlining the tax code.  Our plan calls for greater simplicity so most families will be able to fill out their tax return on a form the size of a postcard.  It would lower tax rates for most families and businesses, streamline seven tax brackets into three, and eliminate a host of special-interest provisions.  Job creators will be able to take advantage of full and immediate expensing on investments in new equipment and technology.  And, America’s 35% corporate income tax rate—the highest in the industrialized world—will be slashed to make us a magnet for business and industry.  Our economy has been growing significantly below its potential for years now, essentially going 20 miles per hour down a highway built for going 70.  One of the keys to getting the American economy firing on all cylinders again is fundamental tax reform.

In 2014, troubling reports of widespread neglect and mistreatment at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) unveiled that our nation’s veterans were not receiving access to quality care they deserve.  Quality care means employees who care, and if employees are not serving our veterans, they need to go. For too long, it has been nearly impossible to fire employees who are not serving our veterans.  While the House passed a bill in 2014 to make it easier to fire some VA employees, it is important that all VA employees be held accountable to the standard required for our veterans. The VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act (S. 1094), which passed with bipartisan support, grants the secretary of the VA additional authority to expeditiously remove employees due to poor performance or misconduct, recoup bonuses and awards, and improve whistleblower protections. It is my hope that this legislation will help the department finally get rid of the bad actors that tarnish the great work being done by the dedicated men and women who work at the VA.  To help meet the principle that our veterans should have the ability to access the best care possible, the House also passed the VETERAN Act (H.R. 2372), which codifies the Internal Revenue Service’s current practice of providing eligible veterans the choice to get financial support for a private plan in lieu of enrolling in health care provided by the VA.    While the VETERAN Act heads to the Senate, the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act now heads to the President’s desk to be signed into law. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress and the Trump Administration for the brave men and women who have sacrificed to make our country and the world a better, safer place to live.","status",NA,NA,45,11,4,0,0,0,0,0

It is refreshing to finally have a President who will protect our national security and economic interests. While I believe America is truly a nation of immigrants, it is important to protect and defend our citizens and the people who come here legally to chase the American dream. Today, the House passed measures that protect our country and crack down on illegal immigration.   Named after a young woman who was shot to death by a seven-time convicted felon and illegal immigrant, Kate’s Law will increase strength in punishment for illegal immigrants with previous criminal records who have re-entered the United States illegally. These changes are critical to the safety of our country, and it is unbearable to think about the American lives lost due to systemic failure in our immigration system. This kind of tragedy is preventable, and I am proud of the House of Representatives for passing this bill today.  The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act combats harmful sanctuary policies and works to curb the number of unlawful immigrants from remaining in our country. Through this bill, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is allowed to rely on probable cause to initiate detainers for the first time. In addition, federal funding can be withheld from jurisdictions who do not comply and communicate with ICE while protecting the jurisdictions who do. Moreover, victims of offenses committed by criminal illegal immigrants are enabled to sue jurisdictions that do not comply with federal law.   Through Sarah and Grant’s Law, which is contained in the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, illegal immigrants who are convicted of dangerous crimes are detained through the duration of their removal proceedings. This section honors the lives of Sarah Root and Grant Ronnebeck who regrettably lost their lives at the hands of criminal illegal immigrants who continued to commit dangerous crimes. We will pray for all families who fall victim to these senseless crimes and work diligently to keep dangerous illegal immigrants off of our streets.","status",NA,NA,118,42,14,7,1,1,0,3

A renewed sense of commitment to our national security reassures the American people and our allies that we are prepared to combat threats to our safety. Whether it is thwarting North Korea and Iran’s threat of nuclear activity, destroying radical Islamic terrorists, or standing up to bad actors like Russia – our armed forces are to be fully prepared at all times. I applaud actions taken by the House today to maintain our military superiority.  This increase in funding is the highest level of funding in history for the Department of Veterans Affairs. When it comes to taking care of the people who have served this country, we must do everything we can to ensure we meet their medical needs. In addition to providing more for mental health care services and suicide prevention, this supplement will reduce the backlog of VA disability claims. Funding for critical military infrastructure is boosted by 25%. Through this legislation, military families and medical facilities are receiving greater support. Our service women and men are finally able to receive the backing they so richly deserve.  In a time when we face a multitude of nuclear threats, it is critical to maintain the Department of Energy’s nuclear weapons security programs. On top of that, unlocking our full energy potential is key to our country’s economic growth. This legislation implements much-needed cuts to programs that limit our ability to achieve energy independence and finally makes way for the onerous Waters of the U.S. rule (WOTUS) to be overturned.  As Texans know very well, our southern border is not secure. For too long, President Obama ignored the immigration laws of the United States. Texans and the American people know it is past time to take greater measures to ensure border security. Finally, we have a president that recognizes the undeniable and imminent threat to our national security and economic interests due to an unsecure border. Whether it is by way of policy changes, building a wall, fencing, or implementation of enhanced technology, it is critical to work towards stopping illegal immigration immediately.","status",NA,NA,127,69,14,1,1,0,3,21

Even Democrats who voted for Obamacare admit that it is broken.    Passing a repeal to Obamacare was a challenging process, and right now, I could not be more proud of my House colleagues for getting it done. On the other hand, I am deeply disappointed in the handful of Republican Senators who are the reason for this unacceptable outcome – many of whom claimed they supported eliminating this flawed law.  Republicans made two policy promises to the American people – the repeal and replacement of Obamacare and fundamental tax reform. In the coming days, the White House and Congress must figure out the best way forward to provide relief from Obamacare while giving them a patient-centered structure that will ensure cost effective access for all Americans.

There is a true spending-driven debt crisis in America. It is the greatest existential threat to our country that receives almost no attention in Washington.  Not only will the national debt break federal and household budgets, but it is a direct threat to our national security. In a time where the world is more dangerous than ever, we cannot afford to short-change the safety and well-being of our citizens.  When the debt was $17 trillion, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen said, ‘the most significant threat to our national security is our debt.’ Now that number is significantly higher with no sign of stopping.  $20 trillion in national debt is a dubious and dangerous milestone that was all too avoidable.

He and his children had to cling to each other to make sure they weren’t swept away. This is the third time in the last eight years his home has flooded. Maria, who has lived in the area for the last 25 years, had to hold on to her husband to get out of harm’s way. While it warms my heart to see how so many Americans have come together to help people who have been displaced, it keeps me up at night to think about people like Guillermo and Maria. We cannot keep rebuilding homes in the same fashion and in the same places and expect different results.  As Congress works through reauthorizing the National Flood Insurance Program, we need to focus on helping the people affected today and say ‘never again’ tomorrow. Never again should we encourage people to continue living in harm’s way and put themselves and first responders at risk. It is important that all Americans who have been affected by these natural disasters receive assistance, but we must enact real reform responsible reforms so as not to cause long-term damage in the future.","link","https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402326","financialservices.house.gov",53,67,1,2,1,1,10,3

Naturally, there are times of crisis and great need such as the ones brought on by the recent hurricanes.

This tax reform stimulates job growth, makes our tax code more simple and fair, and ultimately results in bigger paychecks for working families. Texans and Americans want a tax code that is simple and straightforward, and this legislation delivers tax relief to Americans from all walks of life.  Among many things, the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act enables the American people to:  --Keep more of their hard-earned money each month with lower tax rates  --Get reprieve from the weight of rising costs in child care and education with an expanded Child Tax Credit  --End the nightmare of filing taxes by providing an easy-to-use tax form  --See increased economic innovation and competitiveness that leads to more “Made in America” jobs  --Receive relief from the “estate tax” which doubles and triples taxes on family-owned farms and businesses that are passed to the next generation.  I applaud fellow Texan, Chairman Rep. Kevin Brady (TX-8), and the Committee on Ways and Means for their hard work to deliver results to the American people. I look forward to examining this proposal and hearing from Texans in the 5th District, industry, and stakeholders on how this will affect their businesses and households.","status",NA,NA,35,39,8,3,0,0,1,7

As each of us carry on with our weekend routines – grocery shopping, sporting and civic events, and family time – it is important to stop and say a collective ‘thank you’ to the heroes who courageously served our country in uniform.  As the son, grandson, and brother of veterans, I cannot begin to thank our veterans enough for their service.  My father, Charles Hensarling, was a proud member of the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets and the U.S. Army. He served in the Tenth Calvary, and ultimately obtained the rank of First Lieutenant. From the time I was old enough to understand, my father instilled in me a deep respect and gratitude for those who protect the freedoms we hold so dear.  We must not forget the individuals who hold strong while their loved ones are serving our country. They, too, serve our country and sacrifice for our freedom.    Our country is facing a difficult and, frankly, troubling time. In a time where good news stories sometimes feel few and far between, I reflect upon the words of President Ronald Reagan:  “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.”  It reminds me of why you sent me to Washington. It reminds me of the commitment of so many veterans in Texas and across America. It reminds me that freedom would not be possible without those who serve their country.   Each and every day, I continue to be amazed by the heroes in the 5th District who continue their service after active duty.  This past August, I had the honor of meeting Howard Banks, a 92-year-old World War II veteran from Kaufman, who was attacked when trying to protect the American flag from being stolen from outside of his home.   Congressman Jeb Hensarling meets an American hero, Mr. Howard Banks of Kaufman, Texas.  Though Mr. Banks is legally blind, he never stopped serving his country as he faced the cowards who were attempting to steal his flag, which is our flag. Heroes like Mr. Banks continue to remind the world that America is truly, and always will be, great.  The 5th Congressional District of Texas is home to roughly 42,000 veterans. If you are a veteran – I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your heroism. If you are not, it is my sincere hope that you will take the time to thank a veteran for the sacrifices made for you and your family.  Today and every day, let us never forget the patriots who have answered the call to defend us.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepHensarling/photos/a.10152466102094789.1073741825.7875604788/10156052856109789/?type=3",NA,56,10,1,1,0,0,0,0

The CFPB tramples on the fundamental economic rights of American citizens, taking away their choices and opportunities.  The extreme overregulation it imposes on our economy leads to higher costs and less access to financial products and services, particularly for Americans with lower and middle incomes.  It has routinely denied market participants their due process rights.  All this harm is made even worse by the fact that the CFPB is structurally unconstitutional and completely unaccountable to the American people.   The resignation of the Bureau’s director is an excellent opportunity to enact desperately needed reforms.  The Bureau has an important mission.  Properly designed and led, it can truly protect consumers by ensuring they have access to competitive markets that are vigorously policed for fraud.  That’s the best way to provide consumers with more affordable choices for the financial products and services they want and need.  Americans deserve the opportunity to choose the checking account they want, the mortgage they want and the credit card they want.

We are on the precipice of passing a fairer, flatter, simpler, more competitive tax code, one built for three percent plus economic growth.   The American people can now imagine a tax code that brings jobs and capital back to America. They can imagine a tax code that is simplified from 70,000 pages to 500, where 90 percent of Americans can fill out their return on a postcard. They can imagine a tax code swept of all of the special interest loopholes. They can imagine a tax code creating lower rates for working Americans in small businesses. Now they can imagine a tax code that is all about economic growth. All of my friends on the other side of the aisle can only offer the politics of division, envy, and class warfare. I am proud to support the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act because it is all about better jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepHensarling/videos/10156067185514789/",NA,111,128,14,9,19,2,1,41

The House and Senate passed the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the most meaningful tax reform legislation in over a generation. For those who over the last eight years saw their paychecks stagnate, their savings not recover, and their dreams diminish – help is finally on the way. The legislation now sits on the desk of the President for his signature.  The law lowers tax rates for all Americans, reduces taxes for Main Street small businesses, and generates more ‘Made in America’ labels by finally making our corporate tax rate competitive.  This tax reform plan was built for growth: growth of take home pay, growth of better jobs, and growth of the American dream. Economic growth is also a vital part of the solution to our deficit, and history has shown that meaningful tax reform leads to robust economic growth above three percent. Combined with smart regulatory relief and competent monetary policy, I fully believe that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act can and will deliver sustained strong economic growth.  Of course, we must combine economic growth with meaningful entitlement reform of current programs for future generations in order to deal with our threatening and unsustainable national debt.  Although the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act failed to fully repeal the Death Tax and Alternative Minimum Tax and did not achieve the level of simplicity or flatness I had worked for, it remains a great and historic pro-growth achievement and I am proud to support it.  Among several items, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the legislation will:  • Lower individual taxes and set specific rates at 0%, 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37% -- allowing you to keep more of the money you earn • Roughly double the standard deduction for single and married filers • Continue to allow you to write off the cost of state and local taxes – enabling the ability to deduct property and income taxes • Expand the Child Tax Credit to help parents with the cost of raising children • Deliver tax relief to Main Street by offering new tax deductions • Allow businesses to write off the full cost of new equipment • Protect the ability for small businesses to write off interest on loans • Double the threshold amount for the Death Tax  • Eliminate the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax which helps job creators focus on growing their business instead of filling out burdensome paperwork • Boost American energy production while creating jobs and reducing our dependence on foreign oil • Eliminate Obamacare’s individual mandate penalty tax","status",NA,NA,109,100,11,17,1,0,3,52
