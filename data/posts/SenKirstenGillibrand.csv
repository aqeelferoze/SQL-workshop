Our country is long overdue for a comprehensive national paid family leave plan. It protects families and rewards work—not to mention our small businesses and economy.   Today, we’re debating paid leave across the political spectrum, and that’s a good thing! But the Trump Administration’s proposals fall way short of what a real paid leave plan is really about: Giving all workers (not just new parents) the flexibility they need when major life events happen. Trump’s plan would only help new parents, and no one else. Too many would still be stuck choosing between a paycheck and their families.    A real paid leave plan needs to be national, gender-neutral, comprehensive, affordable, and manageable for workers and small businesses. My bill, the FAMILY Act, does all of this—and it only costs about as much as a cup of coffee a week. Wouldn’t you buy that cup of coffee if it meant you had the flexibility to be with your family when they needed you? —KG","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenKirstenGillibrand/videos/152357028642701/",NA,39,1,23,3,0,0,0,0

I want to thank all the brave first responders who acted so quickly.    These senseless mass shootings must end. We cannot allow this to be the new normal, where tragedy after tragedy happens and we do nothing to address it. It’s not good enough to just send thoughts and prayers and extend our condolences, when people are losing their lives to gun violence.   We are still learning the details about what happened, but here is what we know:   This violence – this mass-murder – is one of the worst massacres we’ve ever seen in our country. And it is yet another reminder of Congress’s failure to act to protect Americans from gun violence.  It’s another disturbing and painful example of how Congress is too weak and too cowardly to stand up to the gun industry. The news reports are saying that the gun was shooting in rapid-fire bursts, for multiple seconds at a time. If that’s what it was, it sounds like a weapon that was specifically designed to kill as many people as possible, as quickly as possible: A weapon of war.  We must pass laws that protect the American people from this kind of horrific violence. The violence in Las Vegas is only the latest tragedy like this. Mass shootings get all the news, but every single day in New York and across the country, gun violence on a much smaller scale is destroying more and more lives.    We must act. We must take gun violence as seriously as we take the threat of terrorism, wherever it is happening. We will get the facts and get to the bottom of this. When we do, let’s honor the lives we have lost by doing something about it – to do everything we can to make sure this never happens again. —KG","status",NA,NA,687,254,63,49,0,2,120,17
