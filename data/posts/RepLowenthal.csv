I also believe a one-sided placement of blame isn’t constructive.  I urged President Obama to veto the U.N. Security Council Resolution because it was a one-sided attempt to place all of the blame on Israel for a lack of progress toward a two-state solution and peace in the Middle East.  The reality is that violence, terrorism, and continued Palestinian incitement to violence is a major impediment to peace.  It is also true that continued expansion of Israeli settlements prevents the two sides from coming together to negotiate a lasting peace.  Unfortunately, House Resolution 11, is one-sided and unbalanced much like the U.N. Resolution.  My position is clear: both the Israelis and the Palestinians must work together to remove these roadblocks to peace—violence, incitement, and the expansion of settlements.  Both sides must come together in productive two-party talks.  Regrettably, both the U.N. Security Council Resolution and the resolution we passed today are distractions from that core aim and therefore I voted against H.Res. 11.  However, I support and I am a cosponsor of, a proposed alternative, House Resolution 23, which is balanced and addresses the concerns I have about the deficiencies of both the U.N. and House resolutions.  Unfortunately, the House Republican leadership blocked multiple efforts to include these critical changes in the resolution which passed the House today.  I will continue to advocate for both the Israelis and Palestinians to engage in meaningful two-party negotiations—the only real path to peace.  Any solution must be balanced and cannot be imposed by external entities—it must come through direct cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians.","link","http://lowenthal.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398797","lowenthal.house.gov",14,3,1,0,0,0,0,0

I hope it is positive, inclusive, and helps heal the wounds of a divided nation. I have my doubts.  One of the key features of his speech is expected to be his elaboration on his Administration’s budget proposal.  Yesterday, the President announced his realization that healthcare is complicated. He may yet discover that a federal budget is just as, if not more, complicated. The broad strokes of his FY2018 budget outline released yesterday call for massive increases in defense spending, at a time when the US already spends more on defense than Russia, China, the U.K., France, Germany, and India combined.   To pay for this military buildup, the President’s final budget almost certainly must contain draconian cuts to nearly every non-defense federal program. Some of the targets he has already suggested? The EPA? Slashed. The State Dept? Slashed. In addition, we expect attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and potentially significant cuts to science and arts funding.  Perhaps most egregious is the President’s notion that eliminating U.S. foreign aid—which represents less than 1 percent of the federal budget--will somehow put America first and make us safer. Presidents and Congresses since the end of WWII have understood that providing aid to war-torn and poverty-stricken nations around the world is one of the most cost effective ways to ensure stability and the spread of democracy. Our aid to nations in need also makes the world a safer place, and ultimately prevents the need to put American soldiers in harm's way.   We have the most powerful military in the world, bar none. Our military forces are the best equipped, the best trained, and the best supplied. We should be focusing on peaceful ways to address international problems and not on making our already second-to-none military even larger.","status",NA,NA,45,9,7,1,0,0,6,0

The President's tone and demeanor was certainly more in keeping with the stature of the office. However, the bar has fallen so low that toned-down anger and a lack of invective seems refreshing. More worrying is that despite the more stately wrapping, the message was essentially the same misinformed nativist populism.   On immigration, the President continued painting immigrants as the boogeymen behind all that plagues our society. Perhaps most frightening was his plan to create an anti-immigrant propaganda arm for the White House to use in convincing the public that immigrants are, as the President has said before, ""rapists and murderers.""   On healthcare, the President laid out the broad strokes of his plan to work with the Republican Congress to eliminate and possibly replace the Affordable Care Act. Judging by the President's comments, his administration's plan will inject chaos into the healthcare system while guaranteeing that fewer people get worse coverage for more money.     The President's speech was also disappointing for the many things he did not mention. First, he did not mention that the FBI and all of our intelligence agencies agree that Russia, one of our nation’s major geopolitical adversaries, attempted to influence the Presidential election that brought him into office. He also didn't mention the communications between his campaign team and Russia prior to the election. And, he failed to note the extensive business contacts so many on his team have with Russia.  He also failed to mention climate change. Although this is not surprising given his nomination of a unabashed foe of the EPA to head the department and his administration’s decision to redact climate change from any acknowledgement on the White House website. In fact, the President spent far more time talking about how he plans to slash environmental regulations that protect Americans every day.   All in all, last night's speech showed me that President Trump can perform to minimum expectations of a president.

For the first time in public since 1963, he spoke of losing his own brother to violence. What we can take from the tragic murder of Dr. King, and what RFK returned to as he finished—was a summation of Dr. King’s spirit, “What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence or lawlessness; but love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or they be black.” Love, wisdom, compassion, and justice.

While hiding under the guise of enhancing opportunities for recreational hunting and fishing on public lands, the SHARE Act is actually an assault on both conservation and gun safety laws.  First, it would undermine some of our nation’s bedrock conservation laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Endangered Species Act, and it fails to authorize important programs like the Land and Water Conservation Fund.   Perhaps the most troubling aspect of this bill, however, is the extent to which it weakens some of our nation’s most essential common sense gun safety laws. This bill literally puts lives at risk and makes it more difficult to prosecute criminals over firearms abuses.  The bill authors want to make silencers—whose sole purpose is to make gunfire harder to detect—easier to obtain.  It would also allow some now-illegal armor piercing ammunition—that is fully capable of piercing body armor like that worn by law enforcement—to be sold, as long as ammunition manufacturers label it for “sporting” purposes.   And most shocking, the bill seeks to allow gun owners in states with fewer gun safety laws to freely travel with their weapons to states with more restrictive gun safety laws.   I believe strongly in ensuring that sportsmen and sportswomen are able to enjoy all the recreational opportunities our public lands have to offer, but this legislation attacks the very conservation laws that protect those federal lands, seriously relaxes commonsense gun safety precautions, and puts lives at risk from gun violence.","link","https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3668/text","congress.gov",22,9,12,2,0,0,0,0

Here is the statement I issued yesterday:  “The Hun Sen regime is making it perfectly clear that it has no intention of allowing a free press to exist in Cambodia, and the government appears ready to use any contrivance it can—intimidation, threats, coercion, and even outright violence—to prevent the people of Cambodia from having independent, reliable, and trustworthy news that is not filtered through the Hun Sen lens.   “RFA in Cambodia has faced a growing escalation of rhetoric from the Hun Sen regime, and now, for the safety of its staff, RFA has been forced to cease operations in Cambodia. It joins the Cambodia Daily newspaper, numerous non-governmental agencies, as well as FM broadcast stations that have been forced to close by the government.  “The democratic principles that the Cambodia people are guaranteed under their constitution are being destroyed—one at a time—by the Hun Sen government and I am appalled.  “The right of political expression, the right of a free media, and the right to dissent, are all being quashed by Hun Sen in an effort to subvert free and fair national elections in Cambodia scheduled for next year.  “This is a crisis situation and I call on the United States ambassador to Cambodia as well as the Secretary of State to express my concern and urge them to take any and all action to stop this out of control situation and assist the Cambodian people.”  https://lowenthal.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398885","link","https://lowenthal.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398885","lowenthal.house.gov",29,7,13,1,0,0,4,3

The CPP requires states to reduce carbon pollution by cleaning up electrical power generation plants, often by moving to cleaner fuel sources. Rescinding the CPP will only slow the transition to cleaner, healthier forms of energy. The CPP was projected to cut power generation sector emissions by at least 32 percent from 2005 levels. With power generation contributing a third of U.S. carbon emissions, this would have been a significant cut, and was a major component of the U.S. commitment to the Paris Accord—which President Trump also pulled out of earlier this year. Ignoring the reality of carbon pollution to bestow favors on billionaire, dirty-energy, special interests harms the health and well being of our families and communities.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/climate/clean-power-plan.html","nytimes.com",13,8,11,0,0,0,4,30

First, it explodes the deficit by $1.5 trillion. The House GOP leaders argues that growth will create enough revenue to make up for the deficits, but this has never occurred and the very idea has been widely debunked by economists. Second, it would dramatically slash taxes for corporations and the wealthiest Americans in the name of this same “trickle-down” growth. We’ve tried this path before, and the middle class gets peanuts. One only needs to look to the economic disaster in Kansas to see the results of “trickle-down” growth. Third, after a decade, it would raise taxes on a significant number of middle-class households. The New York Times warned that families with 3 or more children could see an immediate increase of $2,000, on average. And it hits the middle classes in other ways, such as ending student loan and medical expense deductions. It also ends state and local tax deductions, which will have a terrible impact on California households. The bill is bad for America. If the Congressional GOP wants to discuss common sense changes to the tax code, I am more than willing to sit down and talk.

On Wednesday, the Trump Administration released bids for oil and gas leases in the (NPR-A). Unfortunately, the 10-million-acre auction in the NPR-A resulted in just 7 bids out of the 900 leases for auction. The whole auction only raised $1.2 million. At the same time, the GOP is proposing to open up 1.5 million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development in their tax bill. In fact, they believe based on Congressional Budget Office estimates that the ANWR lease would bring in $2.2 billion and help offset some of the corporate giveaways in their tax bill. If it suffers from the same fate as the NPR-A auction, the ANWR auction would only net $180,000—far short of the $2.2 billion the GOP counted on to help make their tax bill add up. Yesterday, I joined with Reps. Raul Grijalva and Jared Huffman in calling on the CBO to reassess the ANWR cost estimate that features so prominently in the GOP tax bill. This is yet another sign of the serious flaws in the GOP tax bill.

The political staff of the Treasury Dept. has now issued a one-page analysis of the GOP tax plan. It conflicts with all independent analyses of the plan from expert economists. The Treasury analysis rests on the assumption that the GOP tax bill will increase the annual Gross Domestic Product a full percentage point more than the GDP projections by the Congressional Budget Office for the next decade. Other analyses are not nearly this optimistic.The Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress' nonpartisan scorekeeper, estimated it would add less than one-tenth of one percent to yearly GDP growth.   Other analyses point out that the GOP plan will also significantly increase the deficit. The Tax Policy Center said the Senate version would cost $1.5 trillion over 10 years, and the Penn-Wharton Budget Model predicts anywhere from $1.5 trillion to $1.8 trillion added to the debt. This is a bill of goods being sold to the American public—a giveaway to the wealthy being foisted on the backs of working Americans today and their children in the future.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/11/the-treasury-has-finally-explained-how-the-trump-tax-plan-would-pay-for-itself-and-its-already-being-attacked/?utm_term=.f753e6edfa65","washingtonpost.com",36,17,21,1,1,6,6,39
