When China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, a provision was put in place labeling China as a non-market economy (NME) which allows the United States to implement significant anti-dumping duties to protect American companies and workers from unfair Chinese trading practices.  China believes this provision should expire.  “Given continued mercantilist activities, including subsidization, industrial planning, currency misalignment policies, overcapacity, and state-owned enterprises, we believe that the United States must continue the longstanding policy of treating China as a NME, as WTO rules allow,” said Rep. Lipinski and several of his colleagues in a letter to the President-elect.  “Granting China MES would undermine the effectiveness of our trade enforcement policies used to combat unfairly priced Chinese imports.  It is vital that these policies continue to prevent domestic producers from being driven out of business and workers from being laid off due to continued Chinese central planning and non-market policies.”","link","https://lipinski.house.gov/press-releases/lipinski-fights-change-to-chinas-economic-status-that-would-lead-to-american-job-losses/","lipinski.house.gov",19,2,2,2,0,0,0,0

Lipinski led the successful effort to include language in the FAST Act – the five-year transportation funding bill passed last Congress – that made Union Station eligible for these programs.    “Tens of thousands of Metra and Amtrak passengers utilize Union Station every weekday, many of them my constituents,” said Rep. Lipinski.  “The station is in need of revitalization when it comes to the rail infrastructure, environmental conditions, and amenities available to passengers.  That is why I worked hard to get language included in the FAST Act to make Union Station and other similar facilities eligible for federal assistance.  I am very happy that the USDOT has decided to take a critical step toward facilitating work that will transform Union Station into the 21st century transportation hub that people in our region deserve.”    Today’s announcement of an Emerging Projects Agreement on Union Station is a step toward the USDOT awarding a RRIF or TIFIA loan.  The agreement also enables the USDOT to provide planning assistance as the project moves ahead.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repdanlipinski/photos/a.126075024117941.20635.103286879730089/1334747779917320/?type=3",NA,28,3,3,0,0,0,0,0

But as I noted at the time, the ACA did make some important improvements to health insurance access.  More people were given access to health insurance, individuals with pre-existing conditions were no longer charged more for coverage, and children could stay on their parents’ insurance until they were 26.   “It is important to remember that the House was forced to vote up or down on a bill written in the Senate, so the ACA never went through refinement that could have made it better.  But after the bill was passed, the two parties dug their trenches.  Republicans only sought to repeal the whole ACA while claiming to want to replace it.  To date, they have never offered a replacement.  Meanwhile, Democrats who supported the bill did not want to offer changes for fear they would be seen as admitting that the ACA wasn’t perfect.  But I’ve known all along that changes were needed to make the ACA work, so I sponsored, co-sponsored, and voted for fixes more than 40 times.  A few of these passed and became law, but most never did because Washington simply played politics with Americans’ healthcare.    “Now for the first time since 2010 one party has control of the White House, House, and Senate. Republicans are now ready to repeal large parts of Obamacare without proposing a comprehensive, detailed replacement.  I have said all along that I would consider supporting ‘repeal and replace,’ as long as the replacement is better.  I will not support a replacement that takes away access, hurts those with pre-existing conditions, is a give-away to insurers and providers, or makes the middle class worse off than they are now. And I certainly do not support ‘repeal and wait.’  I have voted against full repeal of the ACA a half-dozen times over the past six years and will do so again when the House votes today on the Republican Budget Resolution.  The resolution’s sole purpose is to make it possible for the Senate to avoid a filibuster as they work to pass a repeal of key segments of the ACA while there is still no replacement.  “After six and a half years of posturing and politics, Washington finally needs to get to work on a bipartisan plan to make sure that Americans have better access to quality, affordable healthcare.”","status",NA,NA,112,44,15,9,0,0,0,0

Before he testified yesterday in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he already had shown his ability to change President-elect Trump’s thinking on issues such as torture.  During the Senate hearing, I was impressed by General Mattis' comments regarding the great threat that Russia poses and the need to protect Poland and the Baltic nations, stand up to Iran, work with NATO and other alliances, and strengthen our defenses.    “However, the issue we were faced with in the House was whether to grant a waiver to General Mattis so he could serve as Secretary of Defense.  In order to hear General Mattis’ views on the importance of civilian control of the military and to assuage any concerns about waiving the seven year waiting period for him, he was scheduled to testify before the House Armed Services Committee yesterday.  Mattis agreed to testify, only to be undercut by the Trump transition team which told him not to testify.  This development is very troubling.  In recent history, Congress has failed to exercise its authority on too many occasions, thereby granting more power to the Executive Branch.  It is a bad sign that President-elect Trump’s transition team decided to cancel General Mattis’ testimony and that the House still went ahead with the vote on the waiver.  This is not a good way for Congress to begin with the new Administration.    “I believe General James Mattis has the potential to be a very good Secretary of Defense, but my ‘present’ vote on the waiver is intended to send a signal that Congress must stand up for its own authority, or else we will continue to cede more power to the Executive Branch.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repdanlipinski/photos/a.126075024117941.20635.103286879730089/1335800799812018/?type=3",NA,30,16,1,0,0,0,0,4

So former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn’s lying about a conversation with the Russian ambassador about U.S. sanctions, as well as reports about contacts between Russian intelligence and Trump campaign personnel, are of great concern and need to be fully investigated by Congress and law enforcement.    This also demonstrates the great need for President Trump to make clear that the U.S. will continue to seek to deter Russia’s provocative and risky behavior and to reassure our allies in NATO and elsewhere.  We must effectively counter Moscow’s attempts at influence with American strength and resolve, certainly not with a weak approach to President Putin or with any relief from sanctions.  We should maintain, if not strengthen, our sanctions on Russia until we see demonstrable improvement in their behavior.

I have been working for the past seven years to fix the ACA and make sure that it works for the middle class while not piling up debt on American taxpayers.  Upon a quick review of the bills, I am concerned that they will not help make healthcare more affordable, but less affordable and accessible.  I am also frustrated with the rush to committee consideration of these bills without knowing how much they will cost American taxpayers and how many people will likely lose access to health insurance if they become law.    While further analysis is needed, the Republican healthcare proposal appears likely to increase out-of-pocket spending on premiums and medical bills for many hard-working middle-class families.  At a time when many Americans are speaking out about burdensome and unsustainable premiums and healthcare costs, this simply is the wrong way to go.  Egregiously, the bills do this while also giving a tax break to insurers for their CEO pay.  Congress should not be providing handouts to wealthy executives while making healthcare less affordable for average American families.  After nearly seven years of claiming that they can provide for a comprehensive replacement to the ACA, Republicans are proposing only a partial repeal and replacement that leaves important questions for later.  For example, they have still not explained what they will do to ensure plans are of high quality and treat customers fairly when they get ill.  Without answers to these questions, it is impossible to fully evaluate the current partial proposal in context.  When the ACA was passed in 2010, there were concerns that the impact of the bill was not fully understood even though it was going to have a very large impact on so many Americans.  Before House Republicans move forward with these bills, at the very least they should get a score from the Congressional Budget Office so we know how much this proposal will cost and how many people will (or won't) have health coverage under the proposal.  There should not be a rush to push this through.  Congress and the American people need and deserve more time ‒ and a more detailed proposal ‒ to understand how this will impact our country.  With the fiscal and literal health of the nation at stake, it would be irresponsible to support legislation with so many questions left unanswered.","status",NA,NA,83,45,18,0,0,0,6,0

The Republican healthcare bill repeals a provision in current law that limits how much health insurance companies can deduct from their federal taxes for executive pay.  Right now, health insurance companies can only deduct up to $500,000 of compensation per executive.  Repealing this limit means that taxpayers would lose about $400 million in taxes from insurance companies over the next ten years according to the Congressional Budget Office.  Health insurance companies have a right to decide how much they will pay their executives, but hard-working middle-class families should not be subsidizing this pay.  This is bad policy, and I have offered an amendment to strike this break from the AHCA.    Of course, this amendment does not fix the deep and fundamental problems with the Republicans’ healthcare bill, but it should serve as a reminder about where Congress’ priorities should be.  People from across our nation are worried about rising premiums and out-of-pocket costs that make it hard to get the care they need.

So is Southwest's decision to stop overbooking flights.  I call on the other airline companies to follow, and they all must take additional steps.  Passengers must be better protected.  We must prod, regulate, and/or legislate to make sure this happens.  Before 1978, airlines were heavily regulated.  If airlines won't protect their customers, then maybe we need to bring back some of those regulations.    “Following my questioning at today’s hearing, I believe that airlines need to change their policies on interlining ‒ putting passengers on another airline's flight.  Passengers should be put on another airline if the one they purchased their ticket on cannot get them to their destination in a timely manner by fault of the airline.  This includes, but is not limited to, involuntary denied boarding.  This should be automatic.  They should not have to ask, which is what I was told the policy is right now.  If airlines do not do this, I think we need to re-institute rules requiring them to do so.  At this time of high profit for airlines ‒  reported as 15.3B in 2016 during today’s hearing ‒ it’s time that the airline companies step up and treat passengers better or Congress will have to act.”","status",NA,NA,14,4,2,0,0,0,0,0

This version of the bill is even worse than the original version released last month.  As I said at that time, the AHCA will make healthcare less affordable and accessible for millions of Americans, including thousands of residents in my district.  We need to make the Affordable Care Act (ACA) work better, not replace it with a bill that makes Americans worse off.  According to the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) analysis of the original AHCA bill, 24 million fewer Americans would have health insurance in ten years if it became law.  Out-of-pocket costs would rise for millions more.  The impact of the bill passed today would be even worse because the amendments that were added eliminate critical protections contained in the ACA.  For example, insurance companies would no longer be prohibited from charging individuals with pre-existing conditions more for their coverage, meaning that the cost of coverage would be out of reach for the most vulnerable Americans.    Unfortunately, we don’t have any analysis of the impact of the bill voted on today because it was rushed to the House floor less than 24 hours after the final text was revealed.  This meant that the CBO – and everyone else – had no time to analyze it.  This type of action by congressional leaders is one of the biggest reasons that most Americans are fed up with Congress.  In addition to undermining healthcare access, the bill also includes direct tax cuts for health insurance companies and their executives, as well as tax cuts of about $50,000 a year for those who make more than $1 million.  This is a clear indicator of where priorities lie in this bill.  While I did not vote for the Affordable Care Act in 2010, I recognize its importance in providing healthcare for countless families across our nation and I cannot support this Republican proposal that would undermine this progress.  I know that the ACA needs to be fixed, and that for many Americans premiums and out-of-pocket costs are too high.  But rather than casting the whole law out and jeopardizing healthcare for millions of Americans, I’ve been working in a bipartisan manner over the last seven years to make changes to the ACA to rein in healthcare costs and increase access so that it works better for families and small businesses.  It’s time for Washington to come out of the deep trenches and join me in a bipartisan effort to fix the ACA and make our healthcare system better.  We owe it to the American people to do just that.","status",NA,NA,199,34,18,13,0,0,1,5

The bill requires airlines to provide better service, accommodations, and guarantees of timely arrival for all airline passengers.    “Flying commercial airlines has become an all-too-often unpleasant experience,” said Rep. Lipinski.  “While United and other airlines recently have taken some laudable steps to improve their treatment of passengers, we must do more to provide the flying public with greater protections and service guarantees.  When flights are overbooked, computer systems crash, or other problems occur where the airline is at fault, passengers are left with little recourse and few options to get to their destination.  This bill would make the overall flying experience less worrisome, and would result in greater certainty for passengers arriving at their destinations in a timely manner and how they will be treated when there are delays.”  For more information about the Airline Consumer Protection Act, click on the link below.","link","https://lipinski.house.gov/press-releases/lipinski-introduces-bill-to-provide-needed-airline-passenger-protections/","lipinski.house.gov",19,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ringless voicemail allows callers to send messages directly to a cell phone voicemail inbox without first alerting the user that a call is coming through.   A provider of this technology had been petitioning the FCC to exclude ringless voicemails from the definition of a phone call, which would exempt them from key consumer protections against autodialed calls established by the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.   “Exempting ringless voicemail from existing consumer protection laws would give telemarketers approval to send unlimited unsolicited messages to consumers at the expense of their time and money,” stated Rep. Lipinski.  “Worst of all, while phone users can block phone numbers in order to avoid calls from unwanted parties, there is currently no way to block unwanted messages from ringless voicemail.  This is especially problematic in light of the fact that voicemail storage is often limited and many phone users still use limited-minute or prepaid phone plans.  Increased use of this technology without any consumer protections has the potential to make it difficult for phone users and legitimate callers to communicate.  If presented with this anti-consumer petition, the FCC should reject it.”","link","https://lipinski.house.gov/press-releases/lipinski-leads-house-letter-to-fcc-opposing-unlimited-robocalls-to-cell-phone-voicemail/","lipinski.house.gov",45,16,10,0,0,0,0,4

The renovations would not have been possible without Lipinski securing a $700,000 earmark for the $1.1 million project.  “When the village came to me to ask for federal funding to restore the Stone Avenue Station, I made it a top priority and am very happy I was able to get it done,” stated Rep.

I want to thank the La Grange Area Historical Society, the La Grange Garden Club, and especially Jeannine McLaughlin for all their work in making this restoration possible.  As someone who understands the importance of a strong public transportation system and its value to our community, it is especially gratifying that we were able to get this done.”  “Stone Avenue Station is very important to La Grange and surrounding communities,” said La Grange Village President Tom Livingston.  “Thanks to Congressman Lipinski, the village can continue to build on its image as a transit oriented community.  He has had a big impact improving our community and the region.”  “This beautiful facility honors our history without sacrificing the amenities that people have come to expect from modern public transit centers,” said Palmer Place Restaurant Owner and Metra Director Steve Palmer.  “I can’t thank Rep.

On Monday, the Problem Solvers Caucus – a bipartisan group of 43 members of the House – announced that they had agreed upon a plan that would alleviate much of the proposed 2018 premium spike, help stabilize the individual market, and create a program that can further lower premiums another 10%.    Since the release of the agreement, support has been growing across the country.  Newspaper editorial boards including the New York Times and the Washington Post have endorsed the Problem Solvers’ plan, and many constituents have come up to thank me for this commonsense proposal to make healthcare more affordable.    We have now begun working on drafting legislation to implement the plan.  Caucus members, including myself, have been in contact with senators from both sides of the aisle who have expressed interest in the Problem Solvers’ plan.  Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander announced this week that he is going to work with Democrats on bipartisan legislation to accomplish the same goals as the Caucus’ plan.   I helped negotiate this compromise plan, which is the first bipartisan effort to begin fixing the ACA.  The purpose of this agreement is not to solve all the issues with the ACA, but to take commonsense steps that will make it work better and help American families right now.   Some will oppose this plan because it is a compromise, which means no one got everything they wanted.  Others will oppose it because they want the ACA to collapse.  Some partisans in both parties may even believe that if the ACA fails the other side will get blamed in the next election.  But most Americans just want the ACA to be fixed so that they can access affordable healthcare.  They are tired of the status quo in Washington and want their representatives to work together to solve problems like this.  That is what the Problem Solvers Caucus is doing.","status",NA,NA,54,37,6,2,1,0,0,5

This is especially true when starting at a new school.  All the enthusiasm with having a clean slate and terrific plans for what I was going to be able to teach and inspire my students to learn that year.  It’s an exhilarating feeling.  Remember these days and try to hold on to these hopes and dreams for your students throughout the year, especially on those tough days.    “Teaching well is one of the most difficult things to do, but that’s because it is also one of the most important vocations.  The ability you have to influence young people is incredible.  It is not just reading, writing, arithmetic, and every other subject students need to learn these days.  During these times in our nation filled with anxiety, especially after we witnessed a horrible display of bigotry and hatred by white supremacists and neo-Nazis leading to violence and murder in Charlottesville, Virginia, we are once again reminded how important it is to teach our children the importance of respecting every person and not falling into hate.    “We need to make clear that these vile beliefs and all other forms of hatred towards individuals or groups should be condemned and are never legitimate.  The home is the primary place for children to learn this, in addition to churches, mosques, synagogues, and other places of worship, but as teachers you have a tremendous influence on young people by what you teach in words and actions.  I know that you will do a great job of this because the fact that you have dedicated yourself to teaching shows how much you care about every child and every person.  I thank you for this.    “We never thank teachers enough or give them everything that they deserve for what they do for us.  Today I want to thank you for what you do for our communities and our nation by being teachers.  I will always work to do all I can to give you the support that you need.  Have a great school year!”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repdanlipinski/photos/a.126075024117941.20635.103286879730089/1560373430688086/?type=3",NA,32,5,4,0,0,0,0,1

Two weeks ago, the caucus released a plan negotiated and endorsed by the bipartisan group of 43 House members that will provide relief to individuals, families, and small businesses by implementing, among other things, a guarantee that CSRs will be paid in 2018.    The nonpartisan CBO’s comprehensive analysis states that if CSR payments are not soon guaranteed for 2018, premiums for benchmark plans will go up an additional 20% next year and 25% in 2020.  That’s on top of other increases caused by rising healthcare costs.  In addition, the net federal deficit would rise by $194 billion over ten years because people would be given increased tax subsidies to purchase these more expensive plans.    CSR payments are required under the ACA to help low- to moderate-income individuals pay for out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles, but a flaw in the law did not directly fund them.  As a result, the President has the ability to stop the payments unilaterally.  Americans who rely on the ACA for insurance should not be penalized by the law’s defect.  That is why the Problem Solvers’ plan commits Congress to funding the CSRs.   With premiums for 2018 scheduled to be locked in in early September, the time to act is now.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together, support the commonsense solutions in the Problem Solvers’ plan, and ensure that hard-working American families have better access to affordable healthcare.","status",NA,NA,28,16,9,0,1,1,2,3

The Problem Solvers Caucus healthcare plan will prevent a 20% increase in premiums for benchmark plans by guaranteeing cost-sharing reduction (CSR) funding and help lower rates an additional 10% with a stabilization fund.

If signed into law, the bill would hurt efforts to strengthen the economy and equip workers, especially the middle class, with the training they need for better-paying jobs.  It would also slash investments in infrastructure and economic development, negatively impact access to Pell Grants and after-school programs, eliminate Registered Apprenticeship grants, and cut Workforce Innovation grants.    It would put our overall health and safety at risk by gutting the EPA and other agencies that work to keep our air and water clean, and reduce funding for the law enforcement organizations we rely on.

Ed was a pretty typical American kid.  He loved baseball and his dog, worked hard on one of the longest paper routes in the area, and had dreams of one day using his skills in math to become an engineer.  Those dreams came to sudden end in 1968 in a hail of gunfire just five months into his tour as a Marine in Vietnam.  He was only 20 years old.

Today we learned about how one of these prizes led to bold steps in equipment that will go a long way towards reducing head trauma on football fields, the shop floor of manufacturers, battlefields, and more.","status",NA,NA,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Any trade agreement must include the right to unionize, protection of Buy American laws, environmental safeguards, a dispute resolution process that does not undermine American sovereignty, and strong country-of-origin regulations.  These will protect the middle class.","status",NA,NA,22,10,4,0,0,1,0,0

Unfortunately, not enough people in Washington make this their priority.   Americans in the middle class know that they have often been forgotten or ignored.  President Trump promised that he would change that by delivering trade deals that help the middle class, a much-needed boost for manufacturing, a trillion dollar infrastructure bill, and tax reform that would provide relief for the middle class.  But so far, the President has failed to deliver.","link","https://lipinski.house.gov/opeds/middle-class-hopes-unfulfilled-by-president/","lipinski.house.gov",16,23,3,0,0,3,1,0
