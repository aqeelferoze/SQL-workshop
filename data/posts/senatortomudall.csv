Amber is a 33 year-old with Multiple Sclerosis. She follows a rigorous regimen to manage her illness, including $60,000 in drugs per year as well as regular visits to her neurologist and annual MRIs. But thanks to the ACA, Amber is able to lead a normal life without worrying about going bankrupt in order to access life-saving medical care.   861,000 New Mexicans and 134 million Americans have pre-existing conditions that, before the ACA, would’ve made them “uninsurable.” If President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress get their way, folks like Amber will be at risk of losing the coverage they need to survive.   Tonight, I’ll be sharing the stories of Amber and other New Mexicans as I join my fellow Democrats in the Senate to urge President-elect Trump and the new Republican Congress to put their constituents ahead of politics and work with Democrats to improve the ACA—not repeal it.

This last-ditch move by the federal government's lawyers goes back on the EPA's promise to the people of the state of New Mexico — and especially the Navajo Nation — that it would fully address this environmental disaster that still plagues the people of the Four Corners region.  The Navajo people have been the victims of terrible and deadly environmental injustice over many years. They have good reason to be skeptical now of the government’s honesty about environmental quality. A federal court will eventually decide the EPA’s liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act and other environmental laws. But I believe—regardless of the shameful legal interpretation of liability today or the outcome of any lawsuits in the future—that the federal government has a moral obligation to compensate farmers, small business owners and others injured for their losses; to fully reimburse local and Tribal governments for the costs of responding to the spill; and to continue to pay the costs of independent water monitoring until the people have faith in the water again.

Carmen is the director of a nonprofit focused on providing college access to Native American youth. Her job does not provide her with health insurance, and she relies on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicaid to pay for her family’s annual exams, preventive care and medication.   Two of Carmen's children have allergies that require her to keep working Epi-Pens available at school and at home at all times. When Carmen went to renew her children’s Epi-Pen prescriptions at the beginning of the school year, she was astounded to see that prices had skyrocketed—but the ACA protected Carmen from paying exorbitant prices for her family’s life saving medications. But if President-elect Trump and congressional Republicans have their way, families like Carmen’s will lose their insurance coverage and be left out in the cold.    By repealing Obamacare without replacing it, President-elect Trump and congressional Republicans will create chaos in our health care system and our economy. Just today, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported that President-elect Trump and congressional Republicans's actions would cancel health insurance for 18 million Americans and force insurance premiums to rise as much as 25%—and that’s in just one year! In less than a decade, 32 million Americans covered by the ACA and expanded Medicaid programs would become uninsured.    Tens of thousands of families face the same situation as Carmen.

To build a 21st century economy, create good jobs, and retain a vibrant, young workforce, we need a thriving business sector. New Mexico companies are at the forefront of science, technology, and innovation, but I want to help more businesses take full advantage of opportunities to increase the size and variety of our exports. Approximately 95 percent of the world market lies outside the United States; expanding exports and increasing access to international trade opportunities is essential to helping New Mexico businesses of all sizes succeed.  That’s why I’m pleased to invite you to “Growing New Mexico’s Economy—Exporting to Global Markets,” a free international trade conference in Albuquerque on February 21, 2017. The conference will feature presentations from specialists who will share their expertise on executing successful business strategies, finding available resources, and building strong international partnerships as well as panels stocked with industry professionals, trade experts, resource partners, and New Mexico companies that have successfully increased the exports of their products or services.  Conference participants will have the chance to learn more about regional developments that impact local business, network with fellow business leaders and attend a resource fair where they can receive one-on-one advice from experts about how to seize market opportunities and resolve their business challenges. As a member of both the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, I am proud of New Mexico’s business community and excited about this opportunity to help our companies expand to global markets.  The conference is free of charge but space is limited, so I encourage you to register online as soon as possible. If you have any questions, please contact my Albuquerque Office at 505-346-6791.  I want to thank the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center for hosting us, and the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Border Industrial Association for co-sponsoring this event.

But instead of reform, President Trump has set out rewarding Wall Street insiders and billionaire donors with cabinet and other key positions in the new administration, and the ultra-wealthy and well-connected look to have more power than ever in determining the future of our democracy.  That’s why I’ve re-introduced my Democracy for All Amendment, a constitutional amendment to help get big money out of politics and restore democratic power to the people by overturning the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision and affirming the right of the people to pass state and federal laws regulating spending in elections.  Each year, because of Citizens United and subsequent decisions, the door has opened wider for rich special interests and corporations to pour unlimited sums of money into our elections and root themselves in our government. The only real way we can put our democracy back in the hands of all Americans, instead of a privileged, powerful few, is to amend the Constitution. Our Democracy for All Amendment restores the authority of the American people – through Congress and the states – to regulate campaign finance, so that our elections aren’t put up for sale to the highest bidder.

America draws strength from our values, and Americans put their lives on the line every day to defend those values. I believe that Congressman Pompeo’s views on a set of fundamental questions – including human rights, constitutional rights, and the rule of law – will undercut our nation’s moral authority and undermine our national security.   Though I respect his background and service to the country, I believe that Congressman Pompeo's views on several key issues put him at odds with our nation’s core values of promoting civil liberties, the rule of law, and human rights. Congressman Pompeo supports invasive and unconstitutional government spying programs that violate the privacy of law-abiding American citizens. He has defended the use of torture programs – programs that were a stain on our history, contrary to our principles as a nation, and fundamentally ineffective. Congressman Pompeo says that he wants the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, which is a potent recruiting tool for terrorists and hurts our standing around the world, to remain open, and he thinks detainees can be imprisoned indefinitely. And he has made extremely troubling comments about Muslims, stating that Muslim leaders who have no involvement in terrorism are nonetheless ‘potentially complicit’ in acts of terror, even when Muslims across the globe have strongly condemned the violence of extremists.   The Central Intelligence Agency is an essential pillar of our national security. Every day, the men and women who serve at the CIA work tirelessly and courageously to keep our nation safe. These patriots – and the American people – deserve a CIA director who will lead the agency in a way that keeps America secure and keeps our fundamental values as a nation secure.

Four of her children have very serious medical conditions ranging from mental health issues to severe birth defects, all of which will require lifelong medical attention. Thanks to the Medicaid expansion enabled by the Affordable Care Act, Cathy has been able to afford the medical care that her children need to live quality, fulfilling lives. Cathy credits the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion for giving her the ability to adopt and care for these young children in need of a loving home.  If President Trump and Washington Republicans succeed in their reckless plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement, Cathy’s family will be devastated. Without subsidized healthcare, Cathy and her husband will face enormous costs just to get the basic medication their children need to get by every day. 82,000 New Mexicans are now receiving health coverage—many for the first time—thanks to the Medicaid expansion that took place under the Affordable Care Act.  When Cathy reached out to my office, she said that ""If we as a country take care of the least among us, then we take care of all.” The Republican plan to repeal the ACA will leave vulnerable families like Cathy’s behind with no options and no access to necessary health care. I will do everything I can to prevent a repeal of the ACA to keep families like Cathy's insured, healthy and secure.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/senatortomudall/photos/a.10150115125862870.291254.106433512869/10154796176567870/?type=3",NA,210,44,34,35,0,3,16,3

Turning our backs on desperate refugees and essentially imposing a ban on Muslim immigration projects weakness, not strength. This order not only betrays who we are as nation, but it will make us less safe — fueling anti-American sentiment and potentially inspiring violence.

The Senate — Democrats and Republicans — should refuse to confirm him until he answers whether he supports this policy and its negative impacts on our world standing.

I am concerned that Mr. Tillerson will not be able to commit 100 percent to serving the best interests of the American public for many reasons: his failure to answer for President Trump’s #MuslimBan and how it will damage our international relationships, his lack of diplomatic experience or history of public service, his close personal and business ties to the Russian government, his inadequate answers on climate change and his refusal to completely cut ties with his former employer ExxonMobil.  But I am most concerned that Mr. Tillerson will not be able to speak truth to power while serving on the cabinet. The events of this past weekend show how vital that ability will be in this administration; when different factions of President Trump’s cabinet are competing for his attention, we need a Secretary of State with a clear vision for America’s role in the world—someone who will put American values ahead of everything else. I do not have confidence that Mr. Tillerson has the experience, knowledge, or temperament to stand up to the president—to be a voice of reason, to moderate the president’s extreme views and actions.  For all of these reasons, I oppose Mr. Tillerson’s confirmation. Watch my full speech:   https://youtu.be/aRvwevyFV0c","video","https://youtu.be/aRvwevyFV0c",NA,1142,229,105,114,2,2,0,24

President Trump received nearly 3 million fewer votes than Secretary Clinton. He does not have a mandate to appoint an ultra-conservative justice to the nation’s highest court.  The first 11 days of President Trump's administration have made it chillingly clear how critical it is to have an independent judiciary that will evaluate matters on the facts and precedent, rather than a political agenda, and how fundamental the checks and balances in the Constitution are to our democracy. The Supreme Court will consider many weighty issues, and I will be carefully scrutinizing Judge Gorsuch’s record for how he would rule on workers' rights, laws that keep our air and water clean, and preventing discrimination based on race, gender or sexual orientation, among other issues. But President Trump has emphasized that he was choosing a nominee who would carry out his intention to reverse Roe v. Wade. So I want to be clear where I stand: Roe v.

In her confirmation hearings, Mrs. DeVos showed a severe lack of knowledge about the experience of public school students and young people struggling to repay their student loans, and she clearly does not possess the expertise needed to run the Department of Education. Rather, Mrs. DeVos is a billionaire donor who has spent her fortune on the campaigns of Republican politicians and on advancing her dangerous ideologies. President Trump’s nomination of someone as unqualified as Mrs. DeVos shows the sheer emptiness of his promise to ‘drain the swamp’ of special interests.   New Mexico continues to face persistent obstacles to delivering on our educational promise to young people, and Mrs. DeVos’ reckless commitment to slashing resources for public schools and privatizing our education system would make it even more difficult for New Mexico schools to succeed. I am extremely concerned about the challenges facing poorer schools and at-risk students. And while Mrs. DeVos has spent millions to promote school vouchers as a cure-all for our educational shortfalls, there is ample evidence that these programs benefit middle- and upper-income families like Mrs. DeVos’ at the expense of families in the greatest need of educational resources. Further, Mrs. DeVos has showed a basic lack of understanding about federal education policy, and I am concerned about her willingness and dedication to enforcing policies that protect children with disabilities. Simply put, Mrs. Devos’ ideology and her weak grasp of the issues under the purview of the Department of Education would hurt the students who are struggling the most.    As Secretary of Education, Mrs. DeVos would also be in charge of administering our nation’s student loans programs and ensuring debt repayment from millions of financially-strapped borrowers. Yet shockingly, Mrs. DeVos has refused to pay her own debts and fines. Nearly a decade ago, her Political Action Committee was hit with a record $5.3 million fine for its blatant violation of Ohio campaign finance law. But years later, Mrs. DeVos has still failed to take responsibility for her PAC’s illegal activity and pay the fine. I wrote to Mrs. DeVos, and to the HELP Committee, on several occasions to demand answers on Mrs. DeVos failure to pay the fine, but her responses were evasive, incomplete and demonstrated a complete disregard for the law. Her PAC’s brazen violation of the law, her indifference to paying this massive court-ordered fine, and her unwillingness to provide information to the Senate after repeated requests are all serious factors in my decision to oppose Mrs. DeVos' nomination.   Mrs. DeVos seems to think that the rules don’t apply to her – but I have very clear criteria for what I’m looking for in a Secretary of Education. Our nation needs a Secretary of Education who has the qualifications, the knowledge, and the dedication to ensure that all kids – regardless of background or ZIP code – have the chance to succeed. Mrs. DeVos does not meet that standard, and I will oppose her nomination.  https://morningconsult.com/2017/02/01/devos-nomination-jeopardy-2-republican-senators-jump-ship/","link","https://morningconsult.com/2017/02/01/devos-nomination-jeopardy-2-republican-senators-jump-ship/","morningconsult.com",1273,215,152,110,5,7,3,25

As the former Attorney General of New Mexico, and as a colleague of Senator Sessions’, I made sure to carefully consider all of the available information to determine whether Senator Sessions would be the strong steward for justice and equal rights that we need at the Department of Justice. It is clear to me that Senator Sessions will not be a check against the recklessness of the Trump Administration, and I worry about his commitment to protecting and advancing the rights of all Americans.    The chaotic first days of this administration have made it clear that we need a strong voice at the Department of Justice who will stand up to President Trump’s backwards, and constitutionally questionable, policies. But the president’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, says that Senator Sessions serves as the ‘clearinghouse for policy and philosophy’ in the Trump administration. I find that extremely concerning, given the chilling actions that President Trump has taken since assuming office. President Trump issued an anti-Muslim, anti-refugee executive order that violates all the values we hold dear as a nation. President Trump also fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a dedicated public servant who was doing what any good Attorney General would do: upholding the law, no matter who is president. At Ms. Yates’ confirmation hearing in 2015, Senator Sessions asked her if she believed that 'the attorney general has the responsibility to say no to the president if he asks for something that’s improper.’ If he is confirmed, I hope Senator Sessions intends to listen to his own advice and say no to President Trump when he oversteps – but I do not have enough confidence that he will.    The Attorney General has a solemn responsibility to defend the constitutional rights of Americans of all genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, and backgrounds. That means working to solve the very real concerns and grievances about law enforcement felt by many people in Albuquerque and across the country. It also means standing up for the rights of immigrant families. And it means curtailing invasive, unconstitutional invasions of privacy and illegal spying programs against law-abiding American citizens. On each of these issues, I find Senator Sessions’ record and positions to be misguided.    I respect Senator Sessions' years of public service, but our next Attorney General must curb the dark impulses and actions of our president, and must ensure that every American has equal justice under the law. After carefully considering my vote for Attorney General, I do not believe Senator Sessions has the right priorities to be our nation’s top law enforcement official in this administration.","status",NA,NA,2718,504,289,349,1,7,1,34

After reviewing his record and his testimony before the Senate, I strongly oppose his nomination for Secretary of Health and Human Services.    Over 300,000 New Mexicans have gained health insurance since 2010 thanks in part to the ACA. But if he is confirmed, Congressman Price would lead President Trump and Washington Republicans' reckless effort to take us back to the days when millions of families couldn't see a doctor except in the emergency room, when insurance companies could kick you off your plan for a pre-existing condition and when millions of people were one serious illness from bankruptcy. The Secretary of HHS will have tremendous latitude under the president’s recently issued executive order to unravel the key protections provided by the ACA. If confirmed, I expect Congressman Price will gladly seize that latitude. In his hearings, Congressman Price would not commit to protecting the coverage of every American, and he refused to assure the American people that they will not be worse off under the Trump Administration’s dangerous repeal agenda.    During his hours of confirmation hearings and in his pages of written responses to questions for the record, Congressman Price has not been able to articulate any plan to replace the historic protections of the ACA. The ACA isn't perfect, but its success in New Mexico and across the country is undeniable. We should improve the law, not rip it up. Since Congress passed the ACA in 2010, the percentage of people in New Mexico without insurance has dropped by more than half, from nearly 20% to 8.9% in 2016. The ACA has also been a lifeline to New Mexico's economy, and its repeal could send our state’s economy into another devastating recession.    Even though President Trump promised not to cut Medicare, he has nominated as HHS Secretary a primary architect of extreme efforts to overhaul and privatize Medicare. Congressman Price has also spearheaded plans to gut federal funding to Medicaid, which would place an enormous financial burden on states like New Mexico. Medicaid helps cover our most vulnerable populations: individuals with disabilities, children, seniors and many hard-working low income adults. Over 890,000 New Mexicans depend on the Medicaid program.    I have consistently fought in the Senate to protect the health care of New Mexicans who depend on the ACA, Medicare, and Medicaid. Congressman Price, on the other hand, has a clear record of attacking these bedrock laws. For that reason, I believe he is not fit to be Secretary of Health and Human Services.","status",NA,NA,529,114,38,51,1,0,1,19

That’s why I joined my Senate Democratic colleagues to #holdthefloor and speak out against Mrs. Devos’ nomination. Now that she has been confirmed, I will continue to stand against her uninformed ideas about public education, and I will fight to protect our public schools and teachers.   I believe in the public school system and I want all of our children—regardless of their background or zip code—to have opportunities. The fundamental principle of our American school system is that everyone should be able to get a great education.     Betsy DeVos wants to dismantle our public schools and drain resources from the children and teachers who need it most. Mrs. DeVos has no experience in education or public administration, she didn’t attend public schools, and her children didn’t attend public schools. Instead, her career has been focused on feeding private, for-profit charter schools with public dollars, and religious and other private schools through vouchers.   Mrs. DeVos’ hearings made it clear that she does not have the breadth or depth in education policy or public administration to serve as Secretary. Most concerning for New Mexico, a state with a Native American population over 10 percent, Mrs. DeVos has given me no assurance she understands, cares about, or is prepared to address the needs of Native American students. It is not clear that she appreciates the important role that tribal cultures play in educating Native American children.    DeVos, who will be responsible for overseeing college loans for millions of students, also refuses to acknowledge or pay her own debts. Her PAC has willfully ignored campaign finance laws in Ohio and racked up an unprecedented $5.3 million fine that still has not been paid.

As a Goldman Sachs banker, hedge fund manager, and then the leader of IndyMac starting in 2008 — a poster child for the Wall Street financial crisis — Mr. Mnuchin was at the center of the scheme that turned our economy into a house of cards built on unconscionable mortgage practices and risky bets. Rather than answer for IndyMac's role in bringing down our economy and costing millions of people their homes, Mr. Mnuchin renamed it OneWest and took in record profits as it foreclosed on thousands of homeowners, including many in New Mexico. People across New Mexico are still fighting to recover from the financial crisis – while Mr. Mnuchin has become even wealthier because of it.      I also have serious questions about Mr. Mnuchin’s failure to disclose $100 million in assets and his role as a director of a Cayman Islands investment fund, and I am deeply concerned about reports that Mr. Mnuchin misled the Senate about his bank’s use of ""robo-signing"" on foreclosure documents.

Fortunately, the accident spared Christa’s life, but it left her with soaring medical costs and great uncertainty about her future. She suddenly had new medical needs, including a prosthetic leg, which can cost upwards of $20,000 but is necessary for her to work and maintain her daily routine.   The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, enacted measures that protect coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, and it abolished the lifetime maximum cap, allowing Christa to remain insured. If President Trump and Washington Republicans succeed in repealing the ACA, any insurance company could cut off Christa's health coverage if her medical expenses exceed that company's lifetime benefit limit. The ACA provision that prohibits lifetime benefit limits protects an estimated 555,000 New Mexicans, and an estimated 105 million Americans.   After an astonishing recovery, Christa started her own foundation, Christa's Angels, which supports friends and colleagues in the Haitian town where the earthquake hit seven years ago. She’s also now a world-renowned rock climber. Obamacare has allowed Christa and so many others to be successful in their lives—even in the face of fierce adversity and unforeseen health issues—and I will not stop fighting for her right to affordable and accessible healthcare.

I’ve heard from too many New Mexicans who say that their communities are overcome with fear thanks to President Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies. People are missing doctor appointments, refraining from going to their places of worship, and holding their kids out of school because of what they have heard and seen about ICE deportation enforcement operations. Senator Heinrich and I received an important commitment from Acting Director Homan in our conversation: he pledged to us that ICE will not conduct enforcement operations at places where people are receiving essential care or services. We intend use every tool at our disposal to hold Director Homan accountable to that promise. As I told Director Homan, ICE should focus its limited resources on targeting dangerous and violent criminals.  No one is better off if immigrants keep their kids out of school and are afraid to report crimes and receive medical care.   In response to Acting Director Homan’s commitment, Senator Heinrich and I are asking New Mexicans to contact our offices if they have reports of ICE agents conducting enforcement operations at locations where people receive essential care or services, such as schools, churches, and hospitals.

But according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, President Trump and congressional Republicans’ bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) would cancel health care for 14 million people in just one year, and would lead to 24 million people losing coverage over the next decade. Combined with cruel cuts to Medicaid, women’s health care services, and mental health and substance abuse services; the addition of tax breaks for the wealthiest 0.1 percent; and the inability to address major problems in our health care system, like outrageous prescription drug prices and the cost of nursing home care – this bill is a failure, and it will hurt families across New Mexico and America.   I will stand up against any plan that would hurt New Mexicans and reduce the quality in our current health care system. And my biggest concern is how this bill would hurt New Mexico families and our economy, particularly working families who qualify for Medicaid because it was expanded under Obamacare. The Republican bill resorts to hocus-pocus when it comes to these families, claiming to provide care, but actually slashing an estimated $880 billion over the next 10 years, and cutting Medicaid for an estimated 14 million people by 2026, including the millions of people whose eligibility fluctuates from year to year. Based on our early analysis, all of the 235,000 New Mexicans who gained health insurance under Obamacare's Medicaid expansion could lose their care under the Republican plan.  I’m also deeply concerned about the impact the Republican bill would have on our state’s economy. This morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that New Mexico now has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, 6.7 percent. New Mexico has seen the slowest recovery from the recession, but thanks to Obamacare, one of the few bright spots has been in health — seven of the 10 fastest-growing fields is health care. But the Republicans’ repeal and replace scheme would cost our state up to 19,000 jobs and $2.2 billion in funding, a hit that could throw us back into recession.    President Trump and Republicans just don’t get it; they say families just have to make choices about what’s important. Here’s the reality: thousands of New Mexicans don't have choices. Working moms and dads are raising families on one, two or three hourly wage jobs that don’t offer health insurance. If they’re out for a week or a day taking care of a sick child or parent, they lose wages – and potentially their job. Thanks to Obamacare, they've had a little peace of mind because they've been able to see a doctor if they need to. Without coverage, these New Mexicans will again be left without preventive care and a regular doctor — that is inhumane and a disaster for families, public health, our rural hospitals and the communities they serve.   http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/13/cbo-obamacare-repeal-increase-uninsured-24-million-2026/99117332/","link","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/13/cbo-obamacare-repeal-increase-uninsured-24-million-2026/99117332/","usatoday.com",194,95,84,4,2,7,35,138

Two years ago, he began the process of starting his own small farming business that supports his young daughter and now pregnant wife. Matthew’s family is one of thousands across New Mexico covered by the Medicaid expansion passed under the Affordable Care Act—and having this insurance allowed him to move forward with his dream of building a farm and giving back to New Mexico.   ""Medicaid expansion…is enabling me to start one of the small businesses that are the backbone of New Mexico's economy,” Matthew told me. “If our coverage is taken away or we are forced to pay large premiums, I may be forced to go into a debt that will severely set our family and my business back.”  The ACA’s Medicaid expansion gave Matthew the confidence to make big investments in his small business. But he is worried about Washington Republicans’ plan to repeal the ACA and undo the Medicaid expansion.  Small business owners like Matthew drive our economy and are key to New Mexico's success. But the new Republican health care bill will threaten coverage for thousands of families like Matthew’s from every corner of New Mexico, and could throw our state’s already fragile economy back into recession.   We can’t afford to go back to the days where New Mexico families were one serious illness away from going bankrupt.

Instead of 'making America great,' it will drastically weaken our economy and New Mexicans' health and well-being in order to spend billions of dollars on an unnecessary border wall that New Mexicans reject. Fortunately, this is just a proposal that has no force of law. While President Trump's blueprint would keep work at the labs going and provide further increases for defense spending, it's full of misguided cuts at the expense of middle class families and rural communities. I will always fight for investments in our labs and military bases, but there is no need to devastate the rest of the budget that is also important to New Mexico.   President Trump's proposed budget impacts nearly every aspect of life and the economy in New Mexico. Deep cuts to science, clean energy research and development, space programs, health research, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and the arts and humanities would cripple engines for job creation in New Mexico. His cuts to affordable housing and his complete elimination of heating assistance and community development block grants would literally leave New Mexico families in the cold. Cuts to teacher preparation and before- and after-school and summer programs mean less opportunity for students to prepare for college. Cutting Interior Department agencies could reduce core services to American Indians and Alaska Natives, such as education and law enforcement — services that our nation has an obligation to provide. And cuts to everything from air traffic control to humanitarian aid and vaccinations that prevent the spread of dangerous diseases in developing nations would put New Mexicans at risk.   This budget shows that President Trump has no understanding or respect for rural America. One of the most devastating cuts would be to the USDA water and wastewater loan program, which helps rural New Mexico communities provide water and sewer services. Unlike the previous administration, President Trump’s budget fails to provide enough funding to cover the federal government’s expected costs for fighting wildland fires. It also proposes to cut the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, or PILT, which rural New Mexico counties rely on to compensate them for hosting federal lands and which helps them pay for roads, schools, and public safety. While he likes to fly in style, President Trump would eliminate the Essential Air Service, which helps Carlsbad, Clovis, Deming, Hurley and Silver City provide air travel and recruit business. And cuts to Amtrak almost certainly would eliminate the Southwest Chief and the tourist business it provides to Raton, Las Vegas and other communities.   Slashing the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget by almost a third — when the EPA is already operating at historically low staffing levels — is a gift to polluters at the expense of communities like Farmington and colonias like Anthony and Chaparral. Cutting enforcement would endanger ongoing work to protect clean air and water, and a proposed 30 percent cut to the Superfund program could slow or stop the Gold King Mine cleanup. And President Trump's proposals would undermine our work to combat the impacts of climate change — effects that communities in New Mexico are seeing today and that will dramatically worsen for generations of Americans to come if we don't act now.   Finally, while the idea of zeroing out the budgets for the national endowments for the arts and humanities is something Trump might love to tweet about, those draconian politically driven cuts are terrible for the economy. These agencies help strengthen the creative economy in New Mexico and across the nation. Not only would eliminating the NEA and NEH stifle programs that have enhanced our communities and inspired everyone from school kids in Albuquerque to entrepreneurs in Gallup, it also would mean the loss of hundreds of jobs in New Mexico alone, at the very time when we can least afford it.    I am appalled by the dangerous priorities in President Trump’s budget, and I will continue fighting for a budget that invests in working people and moves New Mexico forward","status",NA,NA,492,139,107,5,2,7,42,82

One in 10 jobs in New Mexico is related to arts and culture. That’s why, today, I reintroduced a bill to stimulate the development of arts businesses, jobs and the creative economy in New Mexico and across the nation. The Comprehensive Resources for Entrepreneurs in the Arts to Transform the Economy (CREATE) Act would support artists, entrepreneurs and workers employed in tourism and cultural development in growing their businesses, accessing federal resources and funding, and expanding their networks with local communities.    We heard enormous support when we first unveiled this bill in New Mexico last year, but we knew it could be improved. I want to thank the many New Mexico artists who offered suggestions and helped shape this updated legislation. They told us that artists and entrepreneurs need more help raising startup funds, and with marketing — so we have added that to the bill.   We are reintroducing the CREATE Act at a time when the arts are facing enormous cuts to funding in our country, making it harder for artists and artistic entrepreneurs to access resources to help grow their businesses and fund their projects. That makes it that much more urgent to pass provisions in this bill to ensure that emerging artists, museums and galleries and artistic entrepreneurs have the support they need to expand our creative economy and create jobs.

She relies on the Medicaid expansion made possible by the Affordable Care Act to insure her two children, one of whom has autism. Without it, Lori would have to pay for her children's health care out of pocket, something she cannot afford to do.    Lori wants to become a social worker to work with New Mexicans on preventing domestic abuse in a state she ""fiercely adores.” She also wants to earn a salary that can help her move from low-income to middle-class. But Lori is concerned about how the Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act will impact her family and her future. She told me ""I feel that, if the ACA is repealed, and if whatever replaces it does not include the medicaid expansion and coverage for pre-existing conditions, my path to the middle class will be obliterated. I won't just lose my health coverage, I'll lose hope of reaching my dream to get my degree and preventing domestic violence in New Mexico.""  Lori is one of 263,000 New Mexicans who could lose the health insurance they gained under Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion if Republicans succeed in cutting Medicaid through #Trumpcare. President Trump and congressional Republicans just don’t get it; they say their plan will give families more choice but the reality is, if Republicans have their way, tens of thousands of New Mexicans—including single, working mothers like Lori who want to give back to their communities—might be forced to choose between finishing school, paying the rent, and affording health insurance for their children.

The Trumpcare bill they are voting on will cancel health care for 14 million people by next year alone, including 263,000 New Mexicans who get care because of the Medicaid expansion.   It’s pretty simple: Trumpcare will be a disaster for New Mexico. It cuts $880 billion from Medicaid, and puts the state of New Mexico on the hook for $11 billion we already don't have in the budget, straining rural hospitals and health care clinics to the brink all across the state. It means regular people will lose access to basic doctor visits, as well as cancer screenings, heart tests, diabetes tests, prescription drugs, and many other forms of health care. It would also decimate our economy: Federal Medicaid spending supports an estimated 50,000 jobs in our state, and these reductions place New Mexico’s fastest growing job industry in danger. If Trumpcare passes, it could throw our state back into recession.    Thousands of New Mexicans have contacted me urging me to fight Trumpcare, and I will oppose this disastrous bill if it makes it’s way to the Senate.

Many of Jonathan's clients can only access his agency's intensive mental health services because they are covered by the Medicaid expansion made possible by the Affordable Care Act. He told me that this coverage has been “a lifeline” to his clients, and the treatment they receive has resulted in many people breaking their cycles of addiction and incarceration. Jonathan is incredibly concerned about how his clients will afford this life-saving treatment if Republicans succeed in gutting Medicaid.   Communities in New Mexico and across our nation are battling an epidemic of prescription opioid and heroin abuse that is ruining lives every day. These addictions do not discriminate; they ravage rural and urban neighborhoods and tear apart families across our state. The Medicaid expansion under Obamacare has been essential to covering mental health and addiction services that help treat substance use disorders. Currently, 1.29 million low-income people with substance use disorders in the United States are covered by the Medicaid expansion and 29.9% of all opioid treatment payments in New Mexico are paid for by the Medicaid expansion.

The abundance of art in our state reflects our unique and diverse heritage, and our artists play a vital role in shaping our culture, and building the future of our state.  The arts are also an important part of our economy. One in 10 jobs in New Mexico is related to arts and culture, from Navajo jewelers in Gallup to performers and artisans in Las Cruces. And from Pueblo sculptors, santeros and weavers in Northern New Mexico to painters in Silver City. That’s why, last year, I introduced a bill to support artists, arts entrepreneurs and workers employed in tourism and cultural development in growing their businesses, accessing funding, and expanding their networks within local communities. And this year, I've updated it thanks to their helpful insight.  We've received enormous support since we first unveiled the Comprehensive Resources for Entrepreneurs in the Arts to Transform the Economy Act – the CREATE Act. But we knew it could be improved. My staff and I traveled across the state – from Gallup, Silver City and Albuquerque, to Santa Fe and Las Cruces – to meet with artists and arts entrepreneurs to get their feedback on this legislation. They told me that they need more help raising startup funds and with marketing — so we have added that. And last week, I reintroduced the bill. It now includes measures to help artists with grant writing, marketing and financial planning, so they're better prepared to handle the business side of things.   The legislation boosts the creative economy in three main ways; it gives support to artists and entrepreneurs to create and sustain arts-related businesses; it helps museums and institutions make art more available to the public; and it provides more opportunities for our communities to access the arts.  These improvements will make a big difference, and I thank all of the artists in New Mexico who offered suggestions and helped shape this updated legislation — and our conversation is not over. Artists and arts entrepreneurs often struggle to grow their businesses and fund their projects, and we need to do more for them in New Mexico. I want to hear from you about this bill and how the arts are important to your community.

I oppose Judge Gorsuch's confirmation and cast my votes against putting him on the court. Judge Gorsuch hasn’t convinced me that he’ll be an independent or compassionate justice who will respect the rights of the individuals who come before the Court. I also strongly believe that the Senate should not move forward with this nomination while President Trump's team is under investigation for its ties to Russia. And finally, this wasn’t President Trump’s seat to fill. Republicans took unprecedented steps to deny President Obama’s nominee for this seat, Merrick Garland, a hearing and a vote, which led us to today.   Unlike all recent nominees, Judge Gorsuch today failed to achieve the required 60 votes during a key procedural vote, and Senate Republicans immediately changed the Senate rules to move him forward anyway, without engaging in any meaningful attempt to seek a compromise. I voted against this partisan power play, and I will vote against Judge Gorsuch's final confirmation.

And I pray that all U.S. service personnel involved in these — and any — U.S. military actions are safe and secure. But the president’s decision to launch last night's retaliation showed a disturbing lack of respect for the extremely dangerous impact our actions can have on American troops and the Syrian people  — and how they could affect the civil war and the greater war against ISIS in the region. It isn't at all clear that further U.S. involvement, military regime change, and occupation of Syria during this complex civil war will truly save lives. In fact, an escalation of our involvement in this exceedingly complicated conflict may only make matters worse.    One of the things that concerns me the most is how quickly President Trump changed tack, from backing Assad to bombing him – over a few days. What does President Trump plan to do if Assad gasses his own people again, and what is the U.S. approach with regard to Russia and Iran, which are propping up the Assad regime? Does the policy of attacking first and asking questions later also apply to other countries where civilian populations are threatened by civil war and authoritarian leadership? After arguing against foreign interventions as a candidate, President Trump has, in less than 100 days, sent hundreds of troops to Syria and now launched a missile attack. The American people should be very concerned that we are heading rapidly toward another war in the Middle East with no strategy, no clear time frame or cost, no clear winner — and no authorization from Congress.    My position is the same under President Trump's administration as it was under President Obama's. Targeted airstrikes in response to chemical attacks may or may not have an impact on Assad’s behavior, but the United States can't afford endless war and occupation in the Middle East. The president should seek a new AUMF for the fight against ISIS. And if he wants to wage war against the Syrian government, the Constitution requires him to seek an AUMF from Congress. If he does not, Congress should vote on whether to allow President Trump to maintain the troops he already sent into Syrian territory. Congress must do its job before our men and women in uniform are sent into another catastrophic war from which many may never return home.","status",NA,NA,541,103,77,25,0,2,7,16

Once again, this administration is stonewalling information that Congress and the American people have a right to see. Americans simply deserve to know who has access to the president and who is working to influence policy at the highest levels. The president brings unprecedented conflicts of interest to the White House, and he already has taken actions in office that suggest he is more concerned with helping people like him – the wealthy and well–connected – than he is with empowering ordinary Americans. By refusing to release the White House visitor logs, President Trump is confirming widespread concerns that the special interests are getting special treatment in this administration.   The president’s promise to ‘drain the swamp’ has never rung more hollow than it does today. If President Trump won’t release this critical information on his own, then Congress must compel him to do so. We must act immediately to pass the MAR-A-LAGO Act to force the Trump administration to release visitor logs from the White House and from other properties where President Trump regularly conducts official business. The American people are entitled to that basic level of transparency.  I introduced the Making Access Records Available to Lead American Government Openness (MAR-A-LAGO) Act on March 24 with Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), and U.S. Representative Mike Quigley (D-Ill.).

They told me that a wall would be an insult to the binational community at the border and damage our relationship with our biggest trading partner, while wasting federal resources and failing to make us more secure. So I welcome the news that President Trump is backing down from his threats to shut down the government unless he gets taxpayer money for a wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border. Congressional Democrats were united against it, and I hope Congress now will be able to agree on a reasonable, bipartisan government funding bill that will support key agencies and programs important to New Mexico.   The border zone is a bright spot in our state’s struggling economy, thanks to a productive trade relationship with Mexico, but President Trump’s rhetoric and policies risk throwing all of that away. Instead of blustering and making threats from Washington, President Trump should visit our border communities to learn firsthand why New Mexicans believe that his unnecessary and offensive wall will hurt our economy and our communities while doing nothing to secure the border.

Our national monuments are treasured by New Mexicans and Americans, hold enormous significance for Tribes, and help fuel an $887 billion outdoor recreation industry that creates and sustains millions of jobs. If Secretary Zinke decides to review Organ Mountains Desert Peaks and Rio Grande del Norte, he will find strong, vibrant monuments that are driving new recreation and tourism-oriented businesses and jobs and that are the pride of the surrounding communities. These monuments are luring thousands of outdoor enthusiasts to New Mexico and invigorating local economies - from retirees and outdoor enthusiasts visiting Las Cruces for OMDP, to tourists drawn to the breathtaking attractions in Taos and the historic Village of Questa, which is hoping to diversify its economy as a gateway to Rio Grande del Norte.     At Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, Indian Tribes are, for the first time ever, co-managing lands, preserving centuries-old sacred areas that contain troves of antiquities and tell the history of early peoples in the Southwest. Monuments like Grand Staircase, Bears Ears, OMDP and Rio Grande del Norte are huge assets to their communities and the economy in New Mexico, Utah and the Mountain West.    Today's order represents yet another broken promise from President Trump. On the campaign trail, the president pledged to carry on the conservationist legacy of Teddy Roosevelt. But today he is beginning the process of going where no president before him has: using never-tested and dubious legal authority to try to reverse national monument designations. As a member of the Appropriations and Indian Affairs committees, I will fight to protect and elevate these cherished monuments, and I won't stand by if the Trump administration tries to open the door to selling them off to the highest bidder.  https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/26/trump-executive-order-could-rescind-national-monuments/100914086/","link","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/26/trump-executive-order-could-rescind-national-monuments/100914086/","usatoday.com",1535,267,598,140,6,17,29,229

The arts and humanities are foundational to New Mexico’s culture, history and economy. One of my top priorities in Washington is to empower the creative communities across our state who entice tourists from around the world, create jobs, and inspire our future generations.    One in 10 jobs in our state is related to arts and culture, and it is essential that we continue to support these vital engines of job creation for New Mexico’s economy. That’s why, as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I fought hard despite President Trump’s proposal to de-fund the NEA and NEH, agencies that provide critical support and funding to strengthen New Mexico’s creative economy and inspire New Mexico’s next generation of writers, painters, jewelers, and more.    This new bill provides strong funding to both agencies in order to support arts and humanities education, and artists, musicians, and cultural tourism in #NewMexico. And, as we consider funding for FY2018, we will continue the fight to ensure the NEA and NEH remain vital partners for our communities.

I am committed to continuing to do everything I can to equip the Forest Service with the resources it needs to help protect our communities, our forests, and our watersheds. That's why I worked hard, as the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Subcommittee overseeing funding for the Interior Department and Forest Service, to secure an additional $407 million for emergency firefighting needs in the omnibus appropriations bill this week. In the last several years, the combination of tight budgets, unrealistic funding constraints — and a growing number of severe wildfires — have forced the Forest Service to dip into funds for forest health and watershed protection to pay for emergency wildfire fighting. This practice has been fueling a destructive cycle in which the Forest Service has to tap funding for programs to prevent wildfires tomorrow … in order to fight severe fires today. We need to end this cycle of ""fire borrowing"" -- for the sake of our communities' safety, our forests' health and the protection of the watersheds that sustain our communities.    This $407 million in emergency funding will carry us through this wildfire season, but it is not a permanent fix. It’s high time we treated wildfires in the West like we do hurricanes, floods and other natural disasters -- without shortchanging communities by taking funds from other important programs at the Forest Service or Interior Department.

I fundamentally disagree with the Trump administration’s position that Bears Ears National Monument was designated without local support and beyond the scope of the Antiquates Act. The administration’s decision to review Bears Ears and 20 other national monuments designated since 1996 is a devastating waste of scarce resources and a sham motivated only by politics. Yesterday, we saw even more evidence: Secretary Zinke announced that he will give the public just 15 days for comment and consultation on Bears Ears -- 75 percent less time than the 60 days he will give all of the other monuments the Interior Department will review.  In opening this public review process yesterday, Secretary Zinke said he believes it is critically important for the United States to be a good steward and neighbor by listening to the American people. But even as he travels to Bears Ears this week for initial meetings, Secretary Zinke is doing exactly the opposite of being a good listener. He is denying the multiple requests of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition for an in-person meeting to discuss the importance of Bears Ears to the Tribes who have ancestral roots there.   Secretary Zinke has repeatedly promised to be an advocate for Tribes. If he means what he said, he should take the time to hear for himself why there is such deep and significant support for Bears Ears among Tribes. And he should give them equal time to explain its cultural significance and the threats Bears Ears faces from vandalism and development. The Trump administration has already taken a number of actions that indicate an indifference – or outright hostility — to the concerns of Tribes. I hope that Secretary Zinke still will chart a different course, meet with the Tribal leaders, and give Tribes and other stakeholders a full 60 days to express their position on the future of the Bears Ears designation.   https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/06/opinion/sunday/will-bears-ears-be-the-next-standing-rock.html?partner=bloomberg&_r=0","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/06/opinion/sunday/will-bears-ears-be-the-next-standing-rock.html?partner=bloomberg&_r=0","nytimes.com",221,40,82,7,1,5,16,43

Children who have no ability to pay their debts shouldn't be shamed, punished at school or even go hungry because their parents can't pay their school meal bills. Shaming students or requiring extra chores from kids who need help paying for lunch is inexcusable — not only does it stigmatize our most vulnerable children, it takes away from time they can be spending on schoolwork or with their peers. This meal shaming can sometimes stand in the way of students' only healthy meal of the day — we can't expect our kids to succeed in the classroom if they are hungry.

I want to thank all of the advocates in New Mexico and across the country who fought this repeal for many months. I am proud to have stood shoulder to shoulder with so many of you in this fight to #CutMethane.   Make no mistake, the Trump administration will keep trying through other means to reverse these protections. But I will keep up the fight for New Mexico taxpayers, jobs and clean air and water.  http://nmpoliticalreport.com/313063/senate-rejects-repeal-of-methane-waste-rule/","link","http://nmpoliticalreport.com/313063/senate-rejects-repeal-of-methane-waste-rule/","nmpoliticalreport.com",688,75,79,112,2,1,1,8

I was glad to secure his commitment to oppose the unilateral withdrawal from NAFTA proposed by the president. Mr. Lighthizer pledged to me that he would give greater consideration to U.S. businesses — many of which are based in New Mexico’s border region and support the livelihoods of thousands of New Mexicans – in any renegotiation of NAFTA.   When I visit border communities and businesses in New Mexico, I hear the same concerns over and over: President Trump’s threats to tear up NAFTA and his hostile rhetoric towards Mexico are hurting border economies and damaging our relationship with New Mexico’s most important trading partner. I have never been a rubber stamp for trade agreements, and I will always stand up for New Mexico and American workers. The fact is that thousands of New Mexicans depend on trade – and our border region is one of the bright spots in our state’s struggling economy, bringing in manufacturers, businesses, and jobs, and providing a gateway for tourists, students, livestock and agricultural products.   I will hold Mr. Lighthizer to his commitments, and I will oppose any changes to NAFTA that would undermine our critical trade relationship and friendship with Mexico. Now that he has been confirmed, I invite Mr. Lighthizer to visit New Mexico’s border communities, so he can see firsthand how border economies are thriving – and how President Trump’s reckless approach to trade threatens that success.","status",NA,NA,198,50,9,11,5,2,0,3

This is about more than just the conduct of President Trump and those in his orbit; it is about the sanctity of our democracy and the integrity of the Office of the President.   It defies logic to believe that President Trump fired Director Comey—who is investigating both Russia's interference in our election and the president's associates for their ties to that attack on our democracy—for any other reason than to interfere with the investigation.    FBI directors are appointed to 10-year terms to avoid political interference in the nation’s top law enforcement organization.

And this monumental effort pays off. I’ve met people in every corner of New Mexico who tell me about the teachers who changed their lives, taught them to push themselves, to go outside their comfort zone, and to never give up.

Business and economic development leaders in Santa Teresa and across the state have told me that the Trump administration’s brinksmanship, confusion, and alarming rhetoric surrounding NAFTA have already hurt our border economies, placing a cloud of uncertainty over businesses and damaging our relationship with our most important trading partner, Mexico.   As we move forward, Congress, New Mexicans and the American people deserve to have the details about the Trump administration's priorities and intentions for NAFTA renegotiation. Given that NAFTA was implemented by congressional legislation that is now law, any significant change to NAFTA will need to come back to Congress for approval.   U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer pledged to me that he will oppose unilateral withdrawal from NAFTA. He also stated that demands for Mexico to pay for a border wall would doom the chances of a successful NAFTA negotiation. He further committed to giving greater consideration to U.S. businesses – many of which are located in New Mexico’s border region and employ thousands of New Mexicans – in NAFTA renegotiation. I will hold the Trump administration to these commitments, and I will forcefully oppose an adversarial or chaotic approach to updating NAFTA that undermines our critical trade relationship with Mexico.

Today, Mr. Comey reiterated to the American people that, beyond any shadow of a doubt, a foreign adversary attacked our democracy. Mr. Comey told the American people that they cannot trust their president to tell the truth. Mr. Comey told the American people that their president tried to end an active investigation into members of his own administration. When Mr. Comey refused to comply with the president’s request to ‘lift the cloud’ of that investigation, the president fired him. And based on what we learned from Mr. Comey’s testimony today, I believe that it is appropriate for President Trump’s actions to be investigated for obstruction of justice.    The overwhelming level of public concern about today’s testimony – and the damning facts that have emerged in this testimony – once again affirm the need for a public and independent commission to investigate this national crisis. Instead of keeping this investigation behind closed doors, there must be an open and public forum, like the 9/11 commission, to shine a light on Russian interference in our election, possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government, and the president’s disturbing actions to hinder this ongoing investigation.

It is a disgrace that Senate Republicans are trying to force an extremely unpopular bill on the country in a week after drafting their TrumpCare bill in secret, excluding everyone except corporate lobbyists and without holding public hearings or seeking bipartisan input. This bill affects one sixth of our economy, and if Republicans are successful, TrumpCare will cause hundreds of thousands of people in New Mexico and millions of Americans in every corner of our state and nation to lose access to health care, prescription drugs, drug addiction counseling, and other life-saving services.    The plan released today takes away coverage from millions and raids Medicaid, all to pay for massive tax cuts for the wealthy. This bill would be devastating for older New Mexicans, families who are struggling to make ends meet, women, people with pre-existing conditions, and New Mexicans in rural areas. Hospital administrators in rural counties, like Guadalupe and Socorro, have told me that losing Medicaid reimbursements would break their budgets and force these small, rural hospitals to limit services or even close.    Since early January, I have received over 10,000 letters, emails and calls from New Mexicans who are pleading with me to help save their ability to see a doctor when they get sick. Over 96 percent of the New Mexicans who have contacted me about health care over the last six months are opposed to TrumpCare and to this dangerous attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act.    New Mexicans and Americans widely reject TrumpCare, and they deserve better. I am committed to working to improve the Affordable Care Act to strengthen health care in New Mexico and across the country. But, as the vast majority of New Mexicans and Americans will tell you, TrumpCare is simply not the answer. I urge my Republican colleagues to reject this disgraceful and disastrous bill.  Since January, I have shared the stories of New Mexicans who have benefitted from the historic protections provided by the ACA.

Too many families across New Mexico share Justin's heartbreak—I’ve heard countless stories of parents and children lost, families torn apart, and neighborhoods decimated by addiction.   The Affordable Care Act has been critical in helping us fight the opioid epidemic and getting people essential mental health treatment; since 2014, when Medicaid was expanded under the ACA in New Mexico, behavioral health services like counseling and addiction treatment have been extended to reach 75 percent more people than before. But the new Senate #TrumpCare bill endangers this important progress. It dramatically slashes the Medicaid funds that have been crucial to helping New Mexico families address the devastating impacts of addiction and mental illness.    TrumpCare also lets insurers off the hook by no longer requiring their plans to include mental health and substance use disorder services. Plans without these services are no help to struggling families in New Mexico.   TrumpCare represents a total retreat and broken promise by its supporters in our government in the face of the defining public health crisis of this generation. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of deaths for Americans under 50. We must do more, not less, to address this terrible scourge on our communities. New Mexico has long suffered from the consequences of the opioid epidemic and our state can’t afford to lose ground, just as we are starting to make progress to get people the services they need.

The Republican bill will gut Medicaid, which has helped hundreds of thousands New Mexicans afford health care—all to pay for a tax cut for the most wealthy Americans. It will take health care away from hundreds of thousands of people across New Mexico and 22 million Americans, endangering the lives and livelihoods of countless families — particularly women, seniors on a budget, people with pre-existing conditions, and families in rural communities. Not only would slashing Medicaid hurt working and low-income families, it would cut off a critical source of funding that could potentially force rural hospitals to close, dealing a devastating blow to our economy.    I will keep fighting to ensure every American can get the quality health care they deserve. The first vote on TrumpCare could be as early as Tuesday, so I need you to make your voices heard. Call everyone you know and urge them to speak out against this dangerous bill. Your stories about how you'll be affected by TrumpCare help me show senators that TrumpCare isn't just about numbers — it's about real people who are really afraid they will lose life-saving care.

One of those Dreamers, Gerardo, reached out to my office to ask me to protect DACA. Gerardo was born in Durango, Mexico, and when he was a toddler, his mother and father crossed the border with him and his older brother. They lived in an aunt’s garage in California for three months before moving to a small town in New Mexico to live with another aunt. Gerardo attended school and was valedictorian of his high school graduating class. He applied for DACA status when he was a junior in high school and, after he received work authorization cards, he began working in his senior year. He told me, “Now I am worried because [DACA] is what allows me to work here, and without it, I don’t know what I’ll do. It gives me security. I know I can call the police if an emergency happens without the risk of being deported. I have that security without something happening to me. . . . It really works. . . . And we want to be here. We don’t want to go back to Mexico. The main thing that my parents wanted for me and my brother is to get an education and the opportunities that come with that. Over here, with an education, we can actually do something with it.”  Dreamers are making our country stronger – reneging on our promise to them now is hurtful and wrong, not to mention a disaster for our economy.

The 800,000 Dreamers—including almost 8,000 New Mexicans—who agreed to participate in DACA represent the best of our country. Many have told me their stories—they are talented, patriotic young adults who want to finish their education and work as teachers, doctors, engineers. DACA allows them legal status so they can stay with their families and give back to the United States of America—their home and the only country many of them have ever known.   I said before today that President Trump is increasingly unfit to be president, and this decision, following on the heels of Charlottesville and the pardoning of Joe Arpaio, is further evidence. It reneges on a promise we made to these kids, puts their future in jeopardy and already is causing fear among families and throughout communities. The decision also spells disaster for our economy: forcing these driven young people out of the workforce could cost us 700,000 jobs and $460.3 billion in economic output over the next 10 years, not to mention a $24.6 billion hit in lost Medicare and Social Security contributions.

They believe our existing national monuments are vitally important to our economy, community and culture, and they don’t want them changed.    The Department of Interior’s report to the president completely ignores New Mexicans’ overwhelming support for the monuments, and doesn’t even offer specifics and meaningful data to back up their vague recommendations. It doesn’t come as a surprise that local voices were not taken into consideration, since Secretary Zinke declined to attend a town hall meeting on Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks and never even set foot in Rio Grande del Norte. It’s clear this report is a politically driven attempt by Washington to justify the administration’s extreme position that public lands should be privatized, leased or sold to the highest bidder.     In stark contrast to the rushed politically driven review the Trump administration holds in their hands, local communities, Tribes, lawmakers and previous administrations spent years working with local constituents and stakeholders to craft the most inclusive proposals possible.

Written behind closed doors and negotiated in secret, the latest TrumpCare bill will eviscerate Medicaid, strip health care away from millions, and eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions—all in order to give a tax break to the wealthiest Americans.   Instead of listening to the American people and working on bipartisan solutions to improve coverage, Republicans in Congress are once again pushing a plan that makes Americans worse off. The Graham-Cassidy bill would end Medicaid as we know it, jeopardizing the health care of 900,000 New Mexicans. It would cut $1.35 billion in federal health care funding for our state by 2026 and even deeper cuts after that, imperiling our state’s hospitals, clinics, and health care workers—as well as the families who rely on them for needed care. It would raise premiums and out-of-pocket expenses for people on the individual market, making everyday medical expenses more unaffordable for New Mexico families. And it would strip protections for people with pre-existing conditions, meaning big insurance companies could go back to charging more for people who are sick – as much as $17,320 for pregnancy, $5,600 for diabetes and over $142,650 for certain cancers. We can’t go back to the days when millions of families are one serious illness away from financial ruin.   New Mexicans are fed up with their care being threatened and having to worry about whether they will be able to afford health insurance for their family. This latest attack is no better than the earlier versions of TrumpCare. Taking care away from millions is unacceptable. Republicans need to stop playing politics and start listening to the American people.  http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/national_and_world_news/senate-gop-musters-final-push-to-erase-obama-health-care/article_4cf057a4-449f-55ac-99dc-39869ac3593a.html","link","http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/national_and_world_news/senate-gop-musters-final-push-to-erase-obama-health-care/article_4cf057a4-449f-55ac-99dc-39869ac3593a.html","santafenewmexican.com",280,326,187,9,18,13,82,472

This mean-spirited bill would strip health care from hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans like these and tens of millions of Americans by eviscerating Medicaid and causing premiums to soar.   The bill, which is even more radical than previous versions of TrumpCare, would punish people for being sick, and take away protections from people with pre-existing conditions. This is a blatantly political attack that will cause real hurt and suffering for people all across New Mexico and the United States, taking millions of families back to the days when they were one serious illness away from financial ruin. The chorus against this disastrous bill is loud and clear, from doctors, patient groups, seniors, and even Republican governors.    This bill would reap some of its worst damage here at home in New Mexico because of the damage it would do to the Medicaid program and the 900,000 people who depend on it. Graham-Cassidy would slash federal health care funding for New Mexico by a staggering $5 billion by 2026 – and the cuts only get worse after that, with New Mexico losing an estimated $60 billion over a 16-year period. These cuts would almost certainly force hospitals and clinics to close and leave families across our state with few options for care when they face an illness or need to see a doctor. The Graham-Cassidy TrumpCare bill brings us back to a time when the big insurance companies were allowed to charge New Mexicans more for being sick – as much as $17,320 for pregnancy, $5,600 for diabetes, and over $142,650 for certain forms of cancer. On the individual marketplace, over 33,000 New Mexicans would lose an average of $3,400 a year in support to help buy insurance.    What Senate Republicans are doing is truly unprecedented: trying to force through a bill to completely upend our health care system and one sixth of our economy without regular order, without debate, without a real analysis from the Congressional Budget Office. Senate Republicans even decided to kill productive bipartisan efforts to improve health care — all to try to jam through a partisan TrumpCare bill to dismantle all the progress we have made under the Affordable Care Act. President Trump and the Republicans are hoping that the American people aren't paying attention. I urge New Mexicans and Americans to show us all that they’re still watching, and that they'll never stop fighting to protect their care.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatortomudall/videos/10155522364817870/",NA,347,198,189,10,8,3,91,230

The bill’s massive cuts to the Medicaid program would devastate access to life-saving health care across Indian Country. The Graham-Cassidy TrumpCare legislation is an irresponsible and dangerous abdication of our federal government’s trust responsibilities to Tribes. If enacted, this bill would jeopardize the health and lives of Native Americans in Tribal and urban Indian communities everywhere.   This damaging bill would totally dismantle all of the advancements we’ve made to expand access to quality health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives. The Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act has provided a lifeline to Indian Country, filling persistent funding gaps at the Indian Health Service and enabling IHS facilities to provide essential services beyond the ‘life and limb only‘ level.  Underfunding at IHS has forced Native health care facilities to ration care – and prior to the Affordable Care Act, people across Indian Country lived by the unofficial motto: ""Don’t get sick after June."" Now, thanks to the Medicaid expansion, many Native Americans finally have access to the services they need to keep themselves and their families healthy. But Graham-Cassidy would undo all that progress.     Republicans are clearly having trouble even selling this misguided bill to senators and governors in their own party. As vice chair of the Indian Affairs Committee, I’ve heard from too many Native Americans who are disturbed by the lack of Tribal consultation in the reckless Republican repeal effort – and who fear the devastating consequences of this TrumpCare approach to legislating. Instead of dismantling the gains we’ve made under the Affordable Care Act, we should be working in a bipartisan way to build on our progress, improve health care, and fully uphold our duties to Tribes. I encourage senators on both sides of the aisle to come together to oppose the Graham-Cassidy TrumpCare legislation and, instead, work to find solutions to ensure that everyone in Indian Country has access to the care they need.  https://www.cbpp.org/blog/like-prior-repeal-bills-cassidy-graham-puts-coverage-for-american-indians-alaska-natives-at","link","https://www.cbpp.org/blog/like-prior-repeal-bills-cassidy-graham-puts-coverage-for-american-indians-alaska-natives-at","cbpp.org",155,123,79,5,1,4,41,120

Killing the Clean Power Plan is a reckless and dangerous decision that jeopardizes the health, safety, economy, and way of life of people in New Mexico and across the country.   Administrator Pruitt’s announcement is completely out of step with the facts on the ground and with the will of the American people, including the broader business community. New Mexicans continue to support and demand action to fight climate change because they already see the devastating effects of climate change in their daily lives. Rising temperatures, more frequent droughts, and increasingly severe wildfires place New Mexico and the Southwest in the bull’s-eye of global warming. We cannot afford inaction.    New Mexico can be a leader in the global clean energy economy, creating thousands of new, good-paying jobs in wind, solar, energy efficiency and other cleaner technologies. But today’s move is a short-sighted attempt to undermine all that progress, and give a competitive advantage to the competition in Asia and Europe.   Yet again, the Trump administration is turning its back on the public interest, and future generations will pay the price. Now, it’s up to all of us – elected officials, states like New Mexico, local communities, businesses – to come together and do our part to make up for the costly mistakes of this administration.  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/scott-pruitt-says-that-epa-will-repeal-the-clean-power-plan/","link","http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/scott-pruitt-says-that-epa-will-repeal-the-clean-power-plan/","pbs.org",218,167,74,8,18,4,78,316

The administration’s decision to cut off CSR payments will send out-of-pocket costs through the roof and jeopardize access to care for millions of Americans. This latest attack on a critical part of the ACA will likely send the individual marketplace into chaos and severely reduce already limited choices, especially in rural areas.   The president couldn’t get TrumpCare through Congress because the American people spoke out in record numbers against it. But rather than listening to the voices of millions of Americans, President Trump is responding to his own failure in Congress with a vindictive move that will cause real pain for families all across the country, especially the most vulnerable.    New Mexicans and Americans are fed up with President Trump and Washington Republicans’ attacks on their health care. It’s time for Congress to come together in a bipartisan way to make these cost-sharing payments permanent, to provide stability to the individual marketplace, and to make common-sense improvements to health care for every family. The president has made it very clear that he is not interested in making these improvements, but I will continue to work with other members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to make these needed changes.  http://krqe.com/2017/10/13/new-mexico-officials-react-to-trump-administration-ending-affordable-care-act-subsidies/","link","http://krqe.com/2017/10/13/new-mexico-officials-react-to-trump-administration-ending-affordable-care-act-subsidies/","krqe.com",417,350,176,16,13,9,115,346

A critical lack of transparency and accountability has left the door open for big money donors, foreign actors, and special interests to take advantage of our electoral and governing processes. As E.J. Dionne says in this column, reform “happens when even those who are skeptical of change realize that the existing system cannot sustain itself. If Trump’s rise and the abuses of his presidency do not persuade us about the depth of our problem, nothing will.”   President Trump has rewarded big money donors with cabinet posts and high ranking positions across our government—and, once in power, many of these officials are putting corporate bottom lines ahead of the health and wellbeing of American families, our environment, and our future. President Trump has refused to acknowledge or address the serious threat posed by foreign interference in our election. And he’s failed to divest from his conflicts of interest or disclose his tax returns or release his visitor logs, leaving the American people to wonder if he’s acting in their best interests, or his own.    I’ve been proud to lead the fight for campaign finance and electoral reform.

Instead, this bill would allow corporations and the richest 1 percent – people making over $733,000 a year – to continue to see the biggest benefits. And it would make the rest of the country pay for it.   This Republican tax plan is full of inequity. It eliminates deductions for state and local income and sales taxes, a key provision for many middle-class families across the country, while repealing the estate tax for the super-wealthy. It gives big corporations a permanent tax break, while eliminating personal exemptions and the student loan deduction. And it was crafted without any consultation with Tribal leaders, even though it would almost certainly force major cuts to programs that Indian Country relies on, and that lie at the heart of the federal government’s trust responsibility to Tribes. This bill is also full of shady political gifts to special interests – from a backdoor measure to open the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, to a provision that would weaken longstanding protections that have prevented secret political donors from abusing tax provisions intended to benefit charities.    I’ll keep fighting for tax reform that really helps New Mexico’s working families and small businesses, but we can already see that this bill doesn’t do that.   https://www.abqjournal.com/1086927/house-gop-tax-overhaul-keeps-retirement-rules.html","link","https://www.abqjournal.com/1086927/house-gop-tax-overhaul-keeps-retirement-rules.html","abqjournal.com",254,236,111,5,6,4,40,192

This weekend, I was honored to join the Museum of Art's centennial celebration. The City of Santa Fe and all of New Mexico are truly lucky to have this iconic museum — which, for 100 years, has exhibited New Mexico artists, brought in visitors from around the world, and advanced the arts in Santa Fe and across New Mexico. From Los Cinco Pintores in 1921, to Will Shuster’s courtyard murals in 1934, to the Santa Fe Chamber Musical Festival beginning in 1973, to its years devoted to showcasing Native American artists, the museum has empowered artists to inspire us, unite us, and speak the truth.     The enduring strength of the New Mexico Museum of Art is a testament to the critical role that the arts and artists play in our nation – and to the immense support that the arts enjoy among New Mexicans and the American people. The arts are an important economic driver, helping to diversify and strengthen our economy in New Mexico, where one in 10 New Mexico jobs is related to the arts or cultural tourism. At the federal, state, and local levels, we must do all we can to support development of the creative economy in our state. That’s why I continue to fight on the Senate Appropriations Committee to ensure that agencies like the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities have the resources they need to support the arts and artists in New Mexico and across the country. I’m glad to have worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stave off President Trump’s disastrous proposal to eliminate these agencies, and to secure level funding for the NEH and NEA in the coming year.     In 1963, John Kennedy gave tribute to poet Robert Frost after his death. President Kennedy quoted Frost, who said, “If sometimes our great artists have been the most critical of our society, it is because their sensitivity and their concern for justice, which must motivate any true artist, makes him aware that our Nation falls short of its highest potential. I see little of more importance to the future of our country and our civilization than full recognition of the place of the artist.”  I agree. The mission of the New Mexico Museum of Art could not be more important in today’s world.

This bill is a bad deal for basically everyone in New Mexico and across the country – except for very wealthy individuals, multinational corporations, and private equity or hedge funds. In fact, this bill will actually raise taxes on many working families down the road, drastically cut Medicare, drive health insurance costs through the roof, and slash a major source of revenue that New Mexico uses to pay for schools, roads and other important services.    Republicans don’t want to talk about the fact that their tax bill will cost $1.4 trillion, and they don’t have the money to pay for it. That threatens future government revenues and long-term budgets for our labs, bases, scientific research funding, and public lands. Unless Congress takes some future, uncertain actions, this tax cut for the wealthy would also trigger deep, mandatory federal budget cuts in order to comply with the Pay-As-You-Go Act, jeopardizing the royalties the federal government pays New Mexico and other Western states for oil, gas and coal developed on public lands. These payments are compensation for resources on publicly owned land in our state, and New Mexico uses the roughly $400 million in royalties to pay for schools, roads, emergency response and other crucial services that taxpayers rely on. These royalties belong to New Mexico taxpayers – and I’m fighting this terrible tax bill that would take your money away.    The bill would also impose mandatory cuts to Medicare providers, and that combined with the provision that dismantles the Affordable Care Act would dramatically increase health care costs for the states. The bill also would  force mandatory cuts to farm payments, public safety, education, and a long list of other programs that supplement state funding and help meet the needs of taxpayers in New Mexico and across the country.   The bottom line is that this tax bill is a scam – a scam that would not only leave taxpayers with less money in their pockets, but also leave the state with fewer resources to meet critical needs. So, while many hard-working New Mexicans would see their tax bill go up, CEOs and corporations would get a big break. For example, CEOs would be able to write off corporate jets, but regular people could no longer deduct student loan interest. That’s outrageous.    I’ve heard from New Mexicans from across the state who are angry about this proposal, and I need you to keep making your voices heard so we can stop this terrible deal for New Mexico.","link","http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/tax-reform-could-cost-millions-for-new-mexico/article_caa6f681-e796-5235-966e-800903c5ac40.html","santafenewmexican.com",118,61,94,2,4,11,28,89

I will continue reviewing the Interior Department's report carefully, but Senator Heinrich and I identified a number of errors in Secretary Zinke’s draft report in September — which were based on hearsay and bad data — and it appears that the secretary is still relying on that wrong information (our letter is here: https://www.scribd.com/document/366413730/Letter-to-Chief-of-Staff-John-Kelly-on-Monument-Review). While Secretary Zinke has assured me that he doesn’t plan major changes, the question of New Mexico’s monuments is now in President Trump’s hands. Until we see what the president will sign, this fight is not over, and New Mexicans should keep calling and writing and making their voices heard.   The president doesn’t have the legal authority to unilaterally revoke or shrink the boundaries of national monuments. And when it comes to decisions about the future of public lands, Americans deserve an open and above-board approach – not the sham process the Trump administration has used to try to justify loosening protections. President Trump and Secretary Zinke withheld information from Congress and the public, declined public meetings about their plans, made recommendations in secret, announced part of their decision, and — only then — released a report attempting to legitimize their conclusions. New Mexicans and the American people were right to be suspicious of the administration’s motives. And after President Trump’s proclamation drastically cutting and re-shaping Utah’s Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, New Mexicans and the American people are right to be outraged.","link","https://www.abqjournal.com/1102271/interior-report-no-changes-to-nm-monument-boundaries.html","abqjournal.com",398,79,70,33,3,1,3,19

Kevin’s death could have — and should have — been prevented. As Dr. Robert Harrison of the University of California San Francisco says, ""Methylene chloride is too dangerous to keep on the store shelves…It's immediately dangerous to life and health. It causes death.""   Under the landmark, bipartisan law Congress passed last year to fix our nation’s chemical safety program, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed banning methylene chloride. But EPA is now backing away from finalizing the ban in response to pressure from manufacturers. This is outrageous. EPA needs to move swiftly to finalize this ban – or other families will face devastating consequences like the Hartley family did.    The Hartley family’s heartbreaking story should serve as a call to action to us here in Washington. We can’t let partisan politics, or special interest priorities, interfere with our work to protect children and families from toxic chemicals and public health threats. As the top Democrat on the Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees the EPA’s budget, I’ll keep working to ensure that the EPA puts your health and safety first.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=dz2nHqUvYU0","video","https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=dz2nHqUvYU0",NA,80,45,45,1,0,5,34,36

Here’s one you might have missed: a backdoor effort to allow millionaires and billionaires to make unlimited tax deductible donations to nonprofits – even churches and charities – that could be used in political campaigns. Thousands of religious organizations and faith leaders are raising the alarm about this misguided proposal to undermine campaign finance rules by politicizing nonprofit organizations.   For decades, a law known as the “Johnson Amendment” has protected religious organizations and nonprofits by requiring that these 501(c)(3) tax exempt organizations refrain from political activity. There are plenty of ways to voice your political views and get involved in elections, and nothing prevents a pastor from speaking his or her mind on Sunday about what is just and moral. But for over 60 years, the law has allowed charities, churches and other houses of worship to focus on serving the needs of worshipers and our communities without the distraction of politics – or worse, division over partisan disagreements.    Now, Republicans want to remove this protection through the tax bill by effectively repealing the Johnson Amendment. This threatens the independence of the nonprofit sector and opens up churches and charities to the pressures of partisanship.    We should listen to the millions of Americans who have said they don’t want their houses of worship and nonprofits to be politicized. Share this post to join me in the fight to stop this dangerous plan to give billionaires yet another way to make unlimited dark money political donations – and get a tax break for doing it.

If the three Republicans on the FCC, led by Chairman Ajit Pai, succeed, internet service providers will be able block, slow, and throttle internet service to certain users, and charge websites and online services for faster and more reliable internet access. This will affect New Mexicans in many ways – from small business owners who rely on the internet to compete with bigger companies, to students who need to access internet content for school, to the growing number of consumers who stream television shows and movies instead of paying higher costs for cable.   As a member of the Commerce Committee and a champion for an open internet, I am urging the FCC commissioners to remember that their primary responsibility is protecting consumers and public interest, not reducing competition for big business. Allowing internet toll lanes is yet another example of President Trump and Republicans empowering big corporations at the expense of ordinary people. And not only would this plan hurt small businesses and consumers, it would prevent state and local governments from passing consumer protection laws for their own residents.  Too many New Mexicans, especially in rural areas, are already stuck in an internet slow lane. Instead of rolling back critical measures that protect internet openness, we should be finding ways to make affordable high-speed broadband accessible for everyone, no matter where you live.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/senatortomudall/photos/a.10150115125862870.291254.106433512869/10155736682872870/?type=3",NA,267,131,106,10,0,8,20,154
