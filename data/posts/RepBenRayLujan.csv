Last century, as Jews were being systematically murdered in Europe, the U.S. had a chance to admit those fleeing the Holocaust, and did virtually nothing. History will not judge the Trump administration favorably for slamming the door in the face of refugees of this century who are desperately trying to keep themselves and their families alive.  The President's move could hamper our nation in the fight against terrorism and will degrade our standing in the eyes of the world. We need smart and tough strategies to keep our nation safe, not reckless, dangerous, and unconstitutional policies.”","status",NA,NA,446,95,75,40,0,1,4,15

According to the President, the Republican replacement bill is “formulated down to the final strokes.” And that it will include “lower [premium] numbers,” and “much lower deductibles.”   This was not a bill crafted down to the final strokes!  What our committee was given was 7 pages of bill text and a placeholder (read it for yourself here: http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF14/20170202/105506/BILLS-115pih-PreexistingConditionsProtectionandContinuousCoverageIncentiveActof2017.pdf). That’s not a replacement plan; that’s a rough draft of a rough draft – at best.   Republicans have had 7 years to come up with a replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act and our committee was presented with a half-written bill. The President and elected officials from his party keep promising that their replacement bill will provide the same protections to patients as the ACA, and give them better access to health insurance and “lower numbers,” and “much lower deductibles.”  Where in the legislative language given to us today are these patient protections? Where are the lower costs? Where are these lower deductibles? I will tell you where – they are nowhere! The only group that benefits by these proposals are the insurance companies, because it puts them back in charge.  I was a brand new Member of Congress when we started working to pass the Affordable Care Act in 2009. At the time, my Republican colleagues went to the floor and laughed that this bill was longer than the bible. They said they didn’t have time to read it or study it and frankly, I think they thought Democrats were foolish because this legislation was as lengthy as it was. But now they’re realizing that the Affordable Care Act was long because health care is complicated and the ACA was thorough. Republicans are finding out now what we learned years ago: you can’t fit the details of a real plan to make healthcare more affordable and life better for American families in a tweet.   When we debated the ACA, we were honest with the American people about how complex this undertaking. Unfortunately, my Republican colleagues sabotaged this bill every step of the way. And now we come to this. Claims that this replacement plan will preserve  protections for patients and provide lower health care costs for the American people and we get 7 pages and a placeholder. Is this really all you’ve got?","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepBenRayLujan/videos/10154128856996121/",NA,467,166,348,36,3,15,13,98

I think we’ve all heard this type of fast and loose sales pitch before – but it’s what we have come to expect from snake oil salesmen, not the President of the United States!”  His rhetoric last night may have been adjusted by his speechwriters to seem more bipartisan, but the President’s actions so far have not offered any common ground on anything – it has all been ‘his way or the highway.’ That’s not democracy.  When it comes to big issues like healthcare, the President can’t continue selling Congress and the American people a bundle of vague promises that bear no resemblance to the heartless and short-sighted policy proposals his allies in Congress are putting forward. If the President wants to finance his healthcare plan by backing a tax increase that will hit more middle-class families and more small businesses than any previous tax in history; that concerns me, but let’s have that debate openly and honestly. Don’t come before Congress and say you’re looking out for working Americans, while your Republican cronies in the front row of the House chamber have proposed raising taxes on those very families.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBenRayLujan/photos/a.10150120386381121.275092.112962521120/10154192774796121/?type=3",NA,149,31,21,7,1,0,2,13

Failing that, President Trump should fire him immediately, just as he fired his National Security Advisor when it was found he lied to the Vice President about his contact with the Russians.”  Virtually every day, new information emerges that underscores the need for an independent investigation into President Trump’s personal, political, and financial ties to the Russians. The American people deserve answers and it is time to proceed with a fair, independent investigation to follow the facts wherever they lead. Honesty, and truthfulness are fundamental components of an effective democracy, and an independent investigation will ensure these ideals supersede politics.

So the question is, if you’re buying health insurance and not getting these things, what are you paying for?   Before the ACA, many Americans bought insurance only to find out that it did not cover necessary care, such as prescription drugs or hospitalization. Under the ACA, all Qualified Health Plans must cover a set of services, known as Essential Health Benefits – providing reassurance to millions of Americans that the health services they need to keep their families and themselves healthy are covered when they buy insurance.  What’s guaranteed?  • Ambulatory patient services (doctor’s visits) • Emergency services • Hospitalization • Maternity and newborn care • Mental health and substance abuse disorder services, including behavioral health treatment • Prescription drugs • Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices • Laboratory services • Preventive and wellness services, and chronic disease management • Pediatric services, including oral and vision care  Stripping EHBs is a backdoor way to allow health insurers to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions.   If they succeed in eliminating EHBs:  •  Insurers could make their benefits bare-bones, dropping benefits entirely or dramatically limiting benefits likely used by those with chronic/serious illness. •  People with pre-existing conditions would not actually be able to purchase plans that cover the benefits they need. It would again allow insurance companies to say “we cover asthma” but not be required to cover any asthma medication. Or “we cover maternal care” but not be required to cover c-sections.  •  In effect, insurers could design benefit packages in such a way as to discourage people with pre-existing conditions from enrolling in the first place.   The purpose of the EHB is threefold:  1. to ensure that coverage provides access to essential health care;  2. to minimize abuse in which insurers design benefits to attract healthier individuals and deter less healthy individuals; and  3. to provide some degree of standardization to make it easier for consumers and small businesses to make apples-to-apples comparisons of plans—which empowers consumers and enhances competition based on price and quality.  Before the ACA: • Only 12 percent of plans on the individual marketplace covered maternity services. In 2011, 62 percent of individual market enrollees did not have maternity coverage. • Nearly two-thirds of people covered through their employer had special limits on inpatient behavioral health services. About one-quarter required higher levels of cost sharing for behavioral health care.  https://www.abqjournal.com/974432/pearce-leaning-no-on-gop-health-plan.html","link","https://www.abqjournal.com/974432/pearce-leaning-no-on-gop-health-plan.html","abqjournal.com",76,15,29,0,0,5,2,3

Look, I might live at the end of a long dirt road, but I didn’t fall off the turnip truck yesterday. And neither did the American people!   Congressional Republicans are jamming through their catastrophic bill that will take health insurance away from 24 million Americans, raise your premiums, raise your deductibles, raise your out of pocket costs, and will slap a crushing age tax on those over the age of 50.   Republicans in Congress promised they would lower costs. But this mess raises costs on families. Not only does the CBO tells us premiums will increase 15 to 20%, but Trumpcare will allow insurance companies to increase deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.   Under the guise of state flexibility, Republicans say they are shifting responsibility to states. Here’s what that means. Trumpcare will force states to raise taxes and ration care.

Res. 34, a resolution under the Congressional Review Act to that will remove the 2016 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rule that protects Americans’ personal information, internet browsing history and other private data from being sold to advertisers and other third parties without their knowledge and to require internet service providers (ISPs) take reasonable measures to protect consumers from hackers.   S.J. Res. 34 passed the Senate last week along a party-line vote with all Democrats voting NO. This week it is being brought to the House floor without any committee hearings or prior debate.  I am voting no on this bill because I believe Americans should have the right to decide how their internet providers use their personal information. S.J. Res. 34 would undo these FCC rules protecting consumers’ location, financial, and health information as well as information about children, Social Security numbers, and content of communications, including email.   House Republicans want to give ISPs the right to gather and monetize personal information from consumers using the internet on their networks.  The implications of collecting Americans’ data are wide ranging. From the New York Times, internet providers  ""can tell the time people wake up by when they check the clock on their phone, or see where users go to lunch or whom they visit. By tracking a user’s browsing of medical websites, a carrier can also determine if that person might have an illness.” (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/technology/congress-moves-to-strike-internet-privacy-rules-from-obama-era.html?_r=2)  S.J. Res. 34 jeopardizes Americans’ privacy now and in the future. If this resolution is signed into law, the FCC may be unable to act in the future to adopt new rules to protect consumers’ privacy and ensure personal sensitive information remains secure. This bill is a sledgehammer that completely nullifies FCC action and the specific legislative language prevents rules “in substantially the same form” from being adopted in the future.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBenRayLujan/photos/a.10150120386381121.275092.112962521120/10154262976676121/?type=3",NA,193,46,42,10,0,4,2,20

Moreover, other equally important problems with the bill remain, including:  • Allowing states to waive the guarantee of essential health benefits, segmenting the market into plans for sick people and plans for healthy people—which will drive up the cost of plans for people with serious health care needs.   • Waiving essential health benefits also undermines the protection against annual and lifetime coverage caps, a critical safeguard for patients.  • Eliminating Medicaid expansion coverage for millions of Americans and altering the program’s financing structure in a way that jeopardizes coverage of new and innovative treatments.  • Increasing out-of-pocket costs for many Americans, including some of the sickest and elderly among us.

But today I am both shocked and saddened by the President’s termination of FBI Director James Comey. To fire the nation’s chief law enforcement official – especially one who is in the midst of a high profile investigation into connections between the President’s top campaign advisors and agents of the Russian government – is at best irresponsible, and at worst, smacks of a cover-up.   Nearly 45 years ago, Richard Nixon fired the special prosecutor who was conducting the Watergate investigation in what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre. In that case the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General had the good judgement and decency to resign in protest over the President’s actions. Today, we seem to have an Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General who are willing to support the President no matter how far out of bounds he steps.   Have we really come to this? A President and an administration so desperate to prevent the facts from coming to light that they will stop at nothing to brush a federal investigation under the rug?  Today’s events have made it abundantly clear that it is past time to appoint an independent commission to look into the Russia-Trump connection and follow the facts no matter where they lead. It may also be worthwhile to have an independent examination the President’s and Attorney General’s actions with regard to the dismissal of the FBI Director as well.  No one is above the law -- especially those sworn to uphold it at the highest levels.

Ensuring all Americans have access to affordable and high quality mental health services should not be a partisan issue – it’s simply the right thing to do.  Peer support has improved health outcomes while lowering healthcare costs. In fact, there is growing evidence that peer support-related strategies can be used as more engaging and successful solutions than current hospital and emergency care related options. Peer support programs provide individualized, managed care to those who need it the most.   The current system for treating behavioral health issues is not sufficient to serve those who need help. It is unacceptable that more than 50 percent of primary care patients with depression go undiagnosed and two-thirds of primary care providers have no ability to prescribe outpatient behavioral health for their patients. Additional, dedicated funding for peer support paraprofessionals will be essential in helping address the current lack of access to behavioral health services in our health care system.

Patterson Sr. of Rio Rancho, who I had the honor of meeting a couple years ago. David was among an elite group of U.S. Marines who helped create the only unbroken code in modern military history.   As one of the Navajo Code Talkers, David and other Navajos coded and decoded classified military dispatches during WWII using a code derived from their native tongue. The Code Talkers took part in every Marine assault in the Pacific, from Guadalcanal in 1942 to Okinawa in 1945, including the Marshall Islands, Kwajalein, Iwo Jima, and Saipan, and their work contributed significantly to the Allies’ ultimate victory over Japan.   After the war, David attended college in Oklahoma and New Mexico, becoming a social worker. He married and raised his family on the reservation in Shiprock, N.M., and worked for the Navajo Nation's Division of Social Services until retiring in 1987. He was awarded the Silver Congressional Medal of Honor in 2001 and until last year, volunteered in a Shiprock school on the Navajo Reservation as a foster grandparent. Mr Patterson was 90.  It is hard to overstate the role that the Navajo Code Talkers played during the war. The commander of the Marine assault on Iwo Jima once said, ""Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.""  Because the code talkers’ role was kept classified for many years, men like David returned heroes, but without a hero’s welcome.  My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and all who loved him. Our nation is in his debt.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBenRayLujan/photos/a.10150120386381121.275092.112962521120/10154776507356121/?type=3",NA,122,3,14,29,0,2,22,0

The bill already has more than 35 cosponsors in both the House and Senate including my New Mexico colleagues, Sen. Tom Udall, Sen. Martin Heinrich and Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham.  Our goal with this bill is simple – to expand the availability of low-cost, high-quality health plans to all Americans by establishing a state public option through Medicaid that would be available to everyone.  Our bill builds on a system that already works. We think our approach has several advantages – namely, it would positively impact Americans at all income levels – but especially middle-class and working class families, so it is targeted at those who face some of the greatest challenges.  This bill will also help consumers in those parts of the country that find themselves with only one insurance carrier or fear that they will be left with no insurance options.

Our bill will help bring innovative new products to market faster and lead to more opportunities/jobs that address tomorrow’s energy challenges.  Recent declines in research funding have resulted in a steep decline in energy technology startup companies. The non-profit foundation created by this bill will serve as a framework to organize, connect, and coordinate partners from government, industry and the venture capital sectors. Similar foundations at the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have all demonstrated that they can raise tens of millions of private sector dollars towards cutting-edge research and innovation. This foundation will help grow our economy and create jobs, leverage the work of our national laboratories and enable new products and services to come to market more quickly.
