Even worse, it now includes a provision that would allow insurers to sell Americans junk insurance plans that limit or deny coverage of essential benefits including hospitalization, maternity care, preventive care,  prescription drugs, and substance abuse treatment. Under this provision, as long as insurers offered at least one comprehensive insurance plan, they could also offer a bunch of plans that – based on CBO’s definition – aren't even health insurance.
