Jake’s story, along with countless others affected by the outbreak, helped bring justice to bad actors at the Peanut Corporation of America who were responsible for the outbreak. After the outbreak, the Energy and Commerce Committee launched an investigation to make sure Peanut Corporation of America – and its leaders like Stewart Parnell – were held accountable for knowingly endangering Oregonians like Jake and Americans across the country. Due in part to Jake’s testimony, Stewart Parnell received a 28-year prison sentence for his role in the outbreak – the toughest penalty for a corporate executive in a food poisoning case.

The Veterans Affairs Medical Scribe Pilot Program Act will set up a pilot program to bring scribes in to do paperwork and record-keeping in the VA process. This legislation will free up the providers we have to actually see patients. I’ve heard from leaders at the VA in White City and Bend who’ve told me that implementing a scribes program within the VA system is paramount to improving the care Oregon veterans receive. This makes a lot of sense for our veterans and for the VA, and I look forward to seeing this legislation moving through the Veterans Affairs Committee.","video","https://www.facebook.com/repgregwalden/videos/1360787140633637/",NA,97,59,6,5,0,0,1,6

When Cycle Oregon and performances at the Shakespeare Festival in Ashland get canceled because of fires and the toxic smoke, it’s long past time for Congress to address how federal forests are managed and how fires are fought (or not), including policies that affect firefighting in wilderness areas.   When people in Central Oregon, the Gorge (or just about anywhere on the east side this summer) are told to stay inside, it’s time for a change in federal policy so that decisions to let fires burn include a review of how doing so will add carbon and toxic pollutants into the atmosphere, threaten habitat and water quality and destroy private timberlands and property.  It’s also time for the U.S. Senate to stop blocking our bipartisan legislation that has passed overwhelmingly in the House year-after-year which would help prevent catastrophic forest fires by allowing proper management. Further, the bill would provide resources to clean up after forest fires and restore the forests with new trees for another generation.   The House Resources Committee has once again approved legislation-- the Resilient Federal Forests Act--that solves the fire borrowing problem, but more importantly, gives foresters and firefighters new tools to help protect our forests, watersheds and airsheds from the kinds of disasters we endured this summer. I know we’re always going to have fires, but we must find better ways to control and extinguish them.   Soon the House will take up this measure and send it to the Senate. I’m convinced President Trump will sign it into law if only we can get it to his desk.","status",NA,NA,1826,522,858,127,0,11,31,67

The initial size-up of the fire was 1/4 acre burning in the 2002 Biscuit Fire and 1987 Silver Fire scars located in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, roughly six air miles west of Pearsoll Peak and north of the Chetco River. The fire is approximately 5 miles northeast of Brookings, Oregon. The area is comprised of mixed conifer and deciduous forest, brush and snags from the 2002 Biscuit Fire and 1987 Silver Fire. The fire is burning in areas of fire scar and islands that were previously unburned. The combination of down, dead fuels with a newly cured grass makes the terrain quite hazardous for firefighters.   Closures: Due to fire activity, and firefighter and public safety concerns, there are trail, road and area closures in place on the Gold Beach and Wild Rivers Ranger Districts. For more information and details regarding the closures, please visit the Forest’s website at http://tinyurl.com/ClosureOrder.  Fire Restrictions: The IFPL (Industrial Fire Precaution Level) is Level IV.   Drones: While there has been no drone activity over the Chetco Bar Fire, please remember that drones interfere with firefighting efforts. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) over the Chetco Bar Fire.

Fuel types across the fire area include Douglas fir stands of various age classes, tan oak and canyon oak, and dense brush fields of manzanita and ceanothus in the older fire scars which contain numerous snags and heavy dead/down. The oak leaf litter will readily support active surface fire spread when dry. Low live fuel moistures in the brush fuels will allow them to actively burn. Some areas within the harvested cut blocks have heavy slash fuel loads and large piles which will burn with intensity.   Significant Events  Extreme, group torching, spotting, short crown runs. There are several areas active around the perimeter. Very Active fire behavior with plume development on the eastern flank, to the south of Pearsoll Peak near Babyfoot Lake. Additional areas on the east flank within Biscuit scar developed plume early in the day. Torching and spots in south, Div G, fire slopped/spotted and is established in Wheeler Creek. Continued backing/flanking/torching near Div M/O break in upper Pistol River drainage. Div K continues with firing/holding 1107 Road. North flank continues to back downslope into Illinois River drainage.    Outlook  Planned Actions  Branch I: Continue suppression efforts to check fire spread from entering the Winchuck drainage. Implement point protection strategies that have a high probability of success. Continue to prep indirect line, identify contingency lines, as well as coordinate with wildland and structural resources. Continue with mop up opportunities around structures.  Branch II: Continue to improve direct dozer line and handline. Plumb and prepare direct lines for mop up. Prepare identified roads for potential firing and holding. Continue to scout and prepare contingency lines as well as scout for containment lines north and west of fire.  Branch III: Continue with line construction to connect Divisions O and R. Continue with scouting opportunities in order to look at additional lines for reducing fire size. Prepare roads for burnout. Scout for direct and indirect lines to the North and East. Build direct and indirect lines where possible. Continue to scout for direct and indirect lines to the North and East, as well as improve roads for future containment spread to the North-Northeast as the perimeter encroaching on the wilderness boundary.  Branch IV: Implement structure protection in Oak Flat, Store Gulch, McCaleb's Ranch, and Footbridge. Scout direct and indirect lines in the Illinois River Area. Continue to open previous lines from previous fires in the area with heavy equipment and coordinate with local Forest Service and Oregon Department of Forestry resources to develop a plan for containment of the fire east of the of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness.  Maintain current coordination with Curry County Sheriff and Josephine County Sheriff regarding evacuation levels while the Oregon State Fire Marshal Task Forces continue structure evaluation and preparation.  Utilize Aircraft to check fire spread when possible.    Projected Incident Activity  12 hours- Active to very active fire behavior. RH recovery poor. Torching, crown runs, spotting to 0.7 mile (maybe further), major runs likely with alignment of wind and terrain, plume development. High potential for large fire growth (Haines 5).   24 hours- Active fire behavior. Torching, crown runs, spotting to 0.5 mile (maybe further), major runs likely with alignment of wind and terrain, plume development. Moderate potential for large fire growth (Haines 5). 48 hours- Active fire behavior. Torching, crown runs, spotting to 0.5 mile, runs possible with alignment of wind and terrain. Moderate potential for large fire growth (Haines 4).   72 hours- Active fire behavior. Torching, spotting to 0.5 mile, runs likely with alignment of wind and terrain. Moderate potential for large fire growth (Haines 4). Possible thunderstorm development.   Anticipated after 72 hours: Active fire behavior. Thunderstorms possible.   Remarks  Due to an increase of fire activity in the NW, PNW 3 will retain command of Branch IV as opposed to previous transfer of command to NW Team 6 that was scheduled.   OSFM transitioned teams, IC is now Les Hallman.   Fire perimeter and acreage have been determined by IR flights. Due to a mechanical reason on the IR flight and heavy smoke layer through the day, there was not an opportunity to fly the fire for perimeter update or acreage increase. There was growth on the eastern flank, south of Pearsoll Peak and growth within the Biscuit scar. There is also established fire in Wheeler Creek.   The Office of the State Fire Marshal is operating under a Delegation of Authority on lands protected by the following jurisdictions having authority: City of Brookings Fire Department, Cape Ferrelo RFPD, and Winchuck RFPD. Additionally, Office of the State Fire Marshal is operating on unprotected land under a Delegation of Authority from the Curry County Board of Commissioners.  Current Weather  Weather Concerns  A red flag warning remains in effect through Monday morning at 9 AM along with an excessive heat warning in effect through 11 PM Monday night. As the upper level ridge and surface trough slide east of the fire area, winds have become westerly and will vary to northerly tonight. Wind speeds of 10 to 15 mph with gusts around 20 mph are expected overnight then will subside on Monday with winds remaining northerly. With moisture slowly returning to the area, cumulus clouds will be on the increase with chances of thunderstorms by midweek. Marine layer will remain between 1,000 and 1,500 feet with poor humidity recovery above the marine layer.","link","http://tinyurl.com/ClosureOrder","tinyurl.com",20,25,19,0,0,5,17,8

Thirteen of these fires have been contained and are in patrol status. The remaining 7 are being managed with a full suppression strategy.   Area, Road, and Trail Closures:   Closure orders have been issued by the Umpqua, Rogue River-Siskiyou, and Fremont Winema National Forests due to hazards associated with fire activity. Road, trail, and area closures have been expanded in and around the Abbott Creek Research Natural Area and the northern portion of the Sky Lakes Wilderness, including a portion of the Pacific Crest Trail. For maps and details see: https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/5503/  Fire History:  On July 26, 2017, lightning started the Blanket Creek fire within the Blanket Creek drainage on the Rogue River/Siskiyou National Forest. On July 29, 2017, a lightning strike started the Spruce Lake fire, burning on the west side of Crater Lake National Park. Continuing lightning events over the following week initiated numerous starts across the region. Northwest Incident Management Team (NWIMT) 7 (Knerr) began management of the High Cascades Complex on August 24, 2017. Transfer of management of the Paradise, Windy Gap and Pup fires in the Falcon Complex from NWIMT 8 (Keith) to NWIMT 7 (Knerr), occurred on Saturday, August 26, 2017.

Paradise 5th Priority-hold and mop-up existing containment lines on north and west, hold fire on east side of Cougar creek while monitoring spread to south.   Projected Incident Activity  12 hours: Persistent dense smoke at lower levels (<5000'), while ridge and peaks will have dry N-NE winds. Areas of very active fire behavior including high intensity flare-ups, torching and spotting due to abundant dry fuels. Acreage increases through spotting and active backing/flanking, with short-range spot fire consolidation. Some clear sky conditions in higher terrain will provide overall increase in fire activity with potential large fire growth.   24 hours: Poor humidity recovery, rapid daytime heating, E-NE gusty winds shifting to W-NW and S-SW during the afternoon. Increasing southerly flow with mid-level moisture introduces cumulus clouds in the area and east. Continued active burning conditions, especially on higher terrain with sunshine.   Remarks  The High Cascades Complex consists of 20 fires, 17 are originally part of the High Cascades Complex and 3 are originally part of the Falcon Complex.   BAER Team in place for Blanket and Spruce Lake Fires   The High Cascades Complex is supporting the Umpqua North Complex with Logistics and Planning functions at the Broken Arrow ICP. Additional support is bein given to North and South Umpqua Zones for IA. Logistical support given to Type 3 organization at Milo managing remainder of Falcon Complex Fires.  Current Weather  Weather Concerns  Continued hot, dry and unstable. Persistent smoky conditions below 5500' will moderate fire activity when present. Potential threat of lightning bringing new ignitions during week. Continued pattern of N-NE dry flow producing poor RH recovery on ridges and peaks will keep fires active through the night.   Current/Observed conditions as of 1600 PDT Saturday 9/2/17  Min RH : 13-16%  High Temp: 85-98°F between 5000-7000 ft  Afternoon ridge winds SW shifting NW late in afternoon 6 mph gusting to 12 mph. Lower level winds slope-driven 3 mph gusting to 6 mph.  A Red Flag Warning was in place over the area today from 1300 to 2000 for dry and unstable conditions with Haines 6. The best conditions for plume domination was in the cleaner air this morning over ridges. Smoke soon filled in the Complex and the instability was mitigated by shading the fuels and fire. Thick smoke over much of the Complex limited visibility to less than 1 mile in many places, especially Helibase. This significantly limited aviation support.  Sunday:  Continued hot, dry and unstable with Haines only at 5 and similar temperatures and humidity. The Haines Index will be highest over ridges with cleaner air much like Saturday. The strengthening ridge will initially trap smoke below 5500 feet, then expanding to ridges by mid-morning, making aviation operations unlikely until mid to late afternoon. Mid-level moisture begins advancing into the region today that may trigger some cumulus buildups to the east in cleaner air, but not certain enough moisture is present for thunderstorms.","link","https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/5503/","inciweb.nwcg.gov",25,27,8,0,0,0,7,9

Still reeling from the attack on the World Trade Center in New York City, Members of Congress were told to evacuate the Capitol immediately after another plane tore through the Pentagon. It was believed the Capitol building was also a target and if it were not for the bravery of 40 Americans aboard United Airlines Flight 93 another iconic U.S. symbol and countless more lives would have been lost. The horrifying images from that day are seared into our national conscious and will forever remind us that we are not invincible and that we are stronger together and united. Today, we remember the thousands of lives who were lost. We remember the first responders and everyday citizens who put their lives on the line to save others.

The legislation we will be voting on today will help strengthen this program and ensure this success continues in Oregon and across the country.
