President Obama’s decision to abstain and not veto 2334 seriously undermines the peace process, abandons Israel at a critical hour in its life as a nation, and does serious injury to the historical record. By calling on countries to distinguish between the State of Israel and Israeli settlements, 2334 enables the narrative of the anti-Semitic boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement—or BDS movement—that is aimed at delegitimizing Israel.  Moving forward, we must work to align U.S. policy with the consensus of the American people: that we are and remain committed to Israel’s sovereignty and security.

This funding will go to life-saving missions, infrastructure repair, funding municipal services and financial assistance to survivors.    Of note, the bill also includes over $1 billion in disaster supplemental nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico in this time of grave humanitarian crisis. In addition to supporting this added disaster relief funding, just days after Maria’s landfall, I joined my colleagues in urging the Administration to immediately deploy all available federal assets to Puerto Rico to reestablish telecommunications services and critical infrastructure on the island and recently met with DOD officials to discuss their response in Puerto Rico. It is encouraging to know that servicemembers from JB MDL are part of the ongoing DOD mission to aid Puerto Rico.   Today’s bill will provide meaningful short term relief to the suffering people of Puerto Rico, but more should and will be done to assist our fellow Americans in their time of need.","status",NA,NA,293,65,30,18,0,0,1,4

Andy O'Neill last night for his actions that saved the life of a father of two in June.  Andy, a 28-year police veteran, won the 2017 Workwear MVP award from ServiceWear Apparel, after being one of 50 nominees for the award from across the country.   On Father's Day, he wasn't scheduled to work, but instead he let another father with a newborn son have the day off to be home with his family. On the job that day, Andy's prompt and effective response to a victim of cardiac arrest saved the life of a local father of two daughters.   Below are my remarks upon presenting Andy with the award:  ""The Talmud says 'whoever saves one life, saves the entire world.'   Every life is precious, unique and irreplaceable.   So it is especially fitting that Sgt. Andy O’Neill has won the 2017 National MVP award for his skill and decisions in saving a man’s life.   It took a team, but that team, that day had an extraordinary leader. And the man whose heart had stopped is here tonight.   Sgt. O’Neill wasn’t supposed to be on the job that day, having selflessly given up his Father’s Day for another dad with a new son.   I wish we could package that kind of goodness.   Thank you Andy – and every police officer – for making our community safer.   For being the single most important deterrent to crime in all of its ugly manifestations.   For doing the dangerous job of apprehending and bringing criminals to justice.   For your critical role in emergencies and natural disasters.   And special thanks to your families for the sacrifice you made.""","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepChrisSmith/photos/a.847727085297880.1073741834.371621772908416/1723712011032712/?type=3",NA,207,35,20,14,0,0,0,1

The State Department estimates that 700-1,000 children per year are abducted out of the U.S. by one parent, against the wishes of the other parent or without permission from a court.   Although the Hague Convention set up a legal avenue for bringing about the safe return of children unlawfully abducted into another country, it lacked sufficient enforcement. Some countries don't abide by the agreement, or their courts may take years to settle cases of abduction -- years of a child's life gone.   Survivor Leo Zagaris, who was abducted to Greece by his father when he was 10, testified on Friday that he could have been home in weeks if the courts moved more quickly. He was gone for two years.   I introduced the Sean and David Goldman International Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act, which was signed into law in 2014. It gave the State Department tools to enforce the international agreement against child abduction and hold countries accountable.   Alissa Zagaris, mother of Leo Zagaris, testified that strict penalties, like criminal charges, when properly applied, can be an effective deterrent against child abduction. ""Taking parents take because they feel they can get away with it,” she said.

The recovery still continues today.   Over the weekend, I visited some areas in Monmouth and Ocean Counties that were among those hardest-hit by the storm, including a dune area slated for improvement and the site of a house destroyed in the storm that is still being rebuilt.   Faith leaders, whose churches provided aid in the wake of the storm, shared their powerful stories of service and rebuilding after the disaster. I also met with local officials, led by Mayor Stephen Reid, at Point Pleasant Beach.   My bill, the Federal Disaster Assistance Nonprofit Fairness Act, would allow houses of worship -- which suffered damage from the storm but helped greatly in the recovery effort after Sandy -- equal access to federal disaster assistance. Many area churches, synagogues, and other religious organizations were not eligible for such aid in the wake of Sandy, due to their religious status.  The bill passed through the House in 2013 with bipartisan support but stalled in the Senate. I have reintroduced it in the House as HR 2405, and it has bipartisan support.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepChrisSmith/photos/a.847727085297880.1073741834.371621772908416/1734897786580801/?type=3",NA,73,60,10,2,0,0,3,1

This sobering exhibit features powerful testimonies and archival items of local genocide survivors from the Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide, and the 1994 Rwandan genocide.   It is part of the crucial work by the Center for Holocaust, Human Rights & Genocide Education at Brookdale to educate future generations about genocide – the “crime of crimes” which still occurs today due to the silence of many. The promise of the genocide convention – “never again” -- remains unfulfilled. The convention’s goals were to prevent and punish genocide.  We have failed, and we need to do more.  It is my hope that exhibits like this one will educate and hopefully sensitize more and more people, including our young people, to realize that we must all speak out to ensure that “never again” becomes reality.

Almost half – 47% ‒ of the taxpayers in my district itemize, claiming an average of $31,981 in deductions.   The elimination – even modification – of the state and local tax deduction (SALT) will significantly increase taxes for many. That’s unacceptable, and reason enough to oppose the legislation. Making matters worse are other provisions in the legislation that nullify or significantly scale back numerous well-crafted deductions including the medical deduction – utilized by 40,000 taxpayers in my district, largely the elderly and disabled, with an average deduction of $9,254 – as well as deductions for student loans, education, property damage, and mortgages, among others.","status",NA,NA,634,375,97,52,1,0,3,22
