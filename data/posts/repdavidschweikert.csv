Since alerting the public in early March about suspicious calls from people posing as Office of the Inspector General (OIG) investigators, the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the OIG have received additional reports and information about the phone scheme from citizens across the country.  According to reports, the calls include a recorded message from an “officer with the Inspector General of Social Security.”  The recording states the person’s Social Security account, Social Security number (SSN), and/or benefits are suspended, and the person should call a non-SSA number to resolve the issue.  The Acting Inspector General advises against calling any number provided by a suspicious source, as the unknown source might pressure you to provide your personal information, or to make a payment or purchase for fictitious reasons.  https://oig.ssa.gov/newsroom/news-releases/march30-advisory","link","https://oig.ssa.gov/newsroom/news-releases/march30-advisory","oig.ssa.gov",10,15,37,0,0,0,0,3
