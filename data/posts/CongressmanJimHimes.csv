Don't open the email. - Don't recognize a link? Don't click on it. - Anyone asks for your credit card, social security number or other information? Don't share it.

At the same time, the House Majority also voted to strip funding from Planned Parenthood, a move that makes the health and well-being of women subordinate to baseless ideology.  Repealing the Affordable Care Act with no replacement creates chaos and frightening uncertainty in the lives of those who rely on it and leaves our nurses, doctors, hospitals and insurance industry facing an unknown future. It will explode the national debt, adding $9 trillion over 10 years, throwing any semblance of fiscal responsibility out the window. As the poor, the sick and the vulnerable are left to fend for themselves, we are failing to live up to the ideals upon which our country was founded.  Those who voted to gut these programs today see only large government and, in their eyes, government is always the enemy. It is to be crippled, defeated and discredited. This is a dangerous worldview. In truth, the Affordable Care Act and health service providers like Planned Parenthood are about people. Your neighbors.  Your family.  I’ve received an outpouring of support from across my district from people whose lives have been changed for the better by the Affordable Care Act. I heard from people who were able to find insurance for the first time in their lives because they had a pre-existing medical condition; keep their child on their insurance until they were 26; get life-saving surgery they couldn’t have afforded without the ACA; and live out a dream to start a new business because they weren’t tied to their old company’s insurance.

Donald Trump has not shown the temperament, integrity or wisdom necessary to run a small town.  But, because of the constitutional process by which we choose our President, he will legally assume that office on Friday.  I respect the decision of those who choose not to attend his Inauguration. Donald Trump has said and done nothing to earn the company and witness of my friend John Lewis.  But I choose differently. Fifty five years ago, a young and idealistic President opened his inaugural address with the observation that an inauguration is ""not a victory of party, but a celebration of freedom."" Presidents Carter, Bush and Obama, Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders and I will be there Friday not to celebrate an intemperate and cynical new President, but to witness a peaceful transfer of power nearly unique in human history. We will also be there as visible evidence that power is shared in our nation, and that President Trump will be checked and balanced by hundreds of people on that inaugural stage.   I have been as vocal a critic of President-elect Trump as anyone. If, as President, he persists in his desire to deny healthcare to millions of Americans, to dismantle the protections that keep Americans healthy and safe; if he continues to favor the wealthiest and luckiest at the expense of the unconnected and disenfranchised, I will oppose him. If he continues to attack the press, denigrate the courts, and ignore our constitutional guarantees in ways that fundamentally erode our democracy – if freedom and liberty are at stake, which they may very well be – I will not stop fighting.   As President John F. Kennedy said on that cold day 55 years ago, ""only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger.

In 1842, Mars and other black Connecticut residents petitioned the Connecticut Legislature to remove the word “white” from the voter eligibility clauses in the State’s Constitution, thereby granting black men the right to vote.  The General Assembly rejected their request.  Black men were not granted the right to vote until the 15th Amendment was added the United States Constitution in 1870. In 2017, the fight for voting rights continues as states pass laws that make access to voting more difficult for African Americans and poor citizens. The fight for equal rights continues as we face problems that unfairly target communities of color, from over policing to diminished funding for schools.

Because frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine, that had nice businesses, they just can’t borrow money … because the banks just won’t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.""  Hearing the President so committed to cutting Dodd-Frank because it hurt his friends’ interests, I expected the language in his Executive Order to be a scathing critique of the status quo. As an author of Dodd-Frank, I prepared myself for the worst.  Instead, the Order was a restatement of principles that are already encompassed in the text of the Wall Street Reform Act. If the President were to read the legislation, I think he would be pleasantly surprised to find that in 2010 we in Congress did the work he is calling for now.  After his first weeks in office, however, I know enough about this President to interpret his order as a direction to the nation’s top financial regulators to gut Dodd-Frank and return to the pre-crisis status quo in violation of his campaign promise to help the middle class. I would caution the Secretary of the Treasury and other officials that a return to 2008 will not accomplish the stated goals and hope that any decisions will be made with the nation’s best interest, and not the best interest of Mr. Trump’s friends – the very people being regulated by Dodd Frank –  in mind.

But this is only the beginning.   It is very unlikely that Flynn acted alone in his outreach to the Russians and it is essential that we get a full accounting of all of the Administration’s ties and communications with Russia before and after the Inauguration. Flynn’s resignation, while important, represents just one more piece in the growing pile of evidence and concerns about the new Administration’s ties to Russia. All of the evidence needs to be unearthed, collected and investigated to reveal the true extent of those ties.  The idea that the National Security Adviser put himself in a position to be potentially blackmailed by the Russians is monumentally disturbing. As a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I know there are vast amounts of classified information that our adversaries want to get their hands on. When that information is put at risk, Congress must conduct a thorough investigation to find out exactly who was involved, what they knew, when they knew it, and what we can do in the future to ensure it never happens again and that there is accountability at the highest levels.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/donald-trump-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-ab-top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0","nytimes.com",332,76,64,7,1,5,1,29

The bill would give fewer people access to health care coverage, and make that coverage more expensive for those who need it most.  The plan would be harmful to poorer Americans because of reduced Medicaid access and a replacement of subsidies with age-based tax credits, while benefiting wealthy Americans through new tax incentives.  The Majority needs to come forward with real plans to improve the ACA that will address rising costs and help middle class families.  This is certainly not that plan, but an ideological bill that will leave millions of Americans twisting in the wind, and I cannot support it.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/upshot/gop-health-bill-would-cut-funding-for-poor-and-taxes-on-rich.html?smid=fb-nytupshot&smtyp=cur&_r=0","nytimes.com",53,14,15,0,0,1,10,28

The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office today revealed that the Republican health care plan would strip health care away from 24 million Americans over the next decade and especially harm low-income people and seniors. Promises that their plan would cover more Americans have now been proven empty. President Trump and Speaker Ryan can now continue to pursue this deeply flawed and unpopular fever dream or they can take the reasonable path forward and work with Democrats to fix shortcomings in the #AffordableCareAct, something they could and should have done years ago.   The #CBO also projected $337 billion in savings over the next 10 years as a result of the bill. As Chair of the New Democrat Coalition, I am as serious as anyone about deficit reduction, but I know than we can find better ways to save money than victimizing Americans by throwing them off their health insurance. It's cruel and will cost lives. Furthermore, the fact that Donald Trump has requested an additional $54 billion in military spending next year alone and still seems on a path to stick American taxpayers with the cost of his border wall shows that he has no real commitment to debt or deficit reduction.","link","http://www.vox.com/2017/3/13/14912520/cbo-ahca-gop-plan","vox.com",128,37,29,3,0,1,10,50

The White House cited Director Comey's handling of the investigation into Secretary Clinton's emails as the reason for the firing, but many will be rightly skeptical of that explanation.     Whatever the merits of Director Comey's decisions, the investigated has just fired the investigator. That should never have occurred prior to the full and complete insulation of the FBI's investigation through the appointment of an independent prosecutor and other measures.

It was therefore and enormous setback when President Trump fired Director Comey in order to stymy that investigation.  The announcement that former FBI Director Robert Mueller will be appointed as special counsel to oversee the investigation in the Justice Department was very welcome news. Director Mueller brings with him two vital factors: a reputation as a man of the highest integrity, honesty and fairness and the widespread respect of the entire FBI.

At the very least, President Trump’s actions should instill a sense of profound worry in the American people about a leader with no sense of propriety or an understanding of the need for independence of law enforcement within the executive branch, an independence that has been respected by Presidents for generations. The testimony, in conjunction with Comey’s firing, also raises the question of whether President Trump was improperly trying to end the investigation into ties between Russia and his campaign affiliates and administration.  Director Comey’s detailed recounting of his multiple meetings with President Trump, and his unusual documentation of those meetings, should have us all asking a fundamental question about whether we can trust this President to uphold and enforce the laws of the United States. It’s clear to me that Director Comey has been asking himself this very question.   Along with the rest of the country, I eagerly anticipate Director Comey’s testimony tomorrow and await the opportunity for our investigation in the House Intelligence Committee to gain access to all relevant documents including his post-meeting memos.

The loss of any life to violence is tragic, but none more so than our children.

It forever shrinks #Medicaid, includes grave cuts to #PlannedParenthood, enables higher deductibles, and lets states opt out of requiring that insurance companies cover essential health benefits, like hospital visits, maternity care, and mental health services.

Domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking are fundamentally corrosive and destructive, and for too long our country did not do enough to deter these crimes. VAWA helped coordinate the resources of local, state and federal agencies to prevent and address domestic violence, while providing victims with critical services. According to the Department of Justice, domestic violence has dropped by more than half since the law was enacted.  Although Congress was divided in 1994, as it is today, Democrats and Republicans came together to pass VAWA because it was the right thing to do. We have the same opportunity today to cut through the bipartisan mire and pass groundbreaking, bipartisan legislation to help Americans. Whether it’s creating a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, simplifying and strengthening our tax code or delivering permanent status to hundreds of thousands of “Dreamers,” this Congress must find a way to work together and produce the meaningful, lasting legislation the American rightfully expect from their elected officials. We must do it because it is good for our country, good for our economy and, most importantly, the right thing to do.   As leader of the forward-looking New Democrat Coalition, I’m excited by the prospect of passing bipartisan, far-reaching legislation that can have as lasting and dramatic an impact on American life as VAWA. I’m hopeful that my more pragmatic colleagues from both sides of the aisle can find a way to put aside our partisan differences and take advantage of this chance to effect lasting change.","status",NA,NA,41,1,7,6,0,0,1,0

Three and a half million American citizens are left in blackout conditions, while temperatures in the high 80s elevate the danger. Images on television don’t accurately represent the true destruction the island has suffered, and only the lucky few with access to generators and satellite-based internet connections are able to communicate with the outside.  This tragedy is not happening halfway around the world, but to a US territory filled with fellow citizens to whom we owe the greatest responsibility. Millions of Americans of Puerto Rican heritage living in the United States, including more than a quarter million in Connecticut, are incredibly concerned for the safety of friends and family members. If we do not act swiftly, the devastation we have already witnessed could start to cost many lives, especially among the elderly and infirm without access to power or water.  Congress should waive the 25% matching requirement for FEMA aid and encourage coordination between the military, hospital ships and relief agencies.  The President should immediately turn his focus to Puerto Rico and use the vast power of his office to direct immediate aid to the island. We must deploy whatever assets we have to restore power as quickly as possible. It must be our top national priority.  The time for evaluating and improving our disaster response can come later, along with the inevitable finger pointing and politicking. We must, as a nation, find a way to help Puerto Rico regain its feet and right its economy in the long term. But today, this hour, right now, we need to save lives.

As always, I am immensely grateful to the first responders who mitigated the loss of life and rushed into harm’s way.  Once again, Congress will retreat into grief and silence. After the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando last year, I excoriated Congress for its continued inaction in the face of endless bloodshed – not only mass shootings, but the ceaseless gun violence that butchers tens of thousands of Americans each year. I refused to stand in silence doing nothing while my fellow countrymen were being slaughtered.  Yet here we are, more than a year later. Almost 5 years after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School took the lives of 26 innocents, including 20 children.  And Congress. Has. Done. Nothing.

By declaring the JCPOA to be against the United States’ national interest, and refusing to acknowledge Iranian compliance with the agreement by October 15th, the President could undo years of delicate negotiations and greatly increase the likelihood of a nuclear Iran. This would be a dangerous and shortsighted decision.   The JCPOA is working. You don’t have to take my word for it – the President’s Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, said the agreement is in the United States’ national security interest and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, said the agreement has “delayed the development of a nuclear capability by Iran.” We also have means of independent verification through international inspectors and both our intelligence apparatus and those of our allies. There is simply no reasonable doubt that Iran is further away from a nuclear weapon now than if this deal had not gone into effect.  Additionally, as we face down the threat of a nuclear North Korea, we must have access to every diplomatic option in order to ensure the best outcome. If we withdraw from the Iran deal, we disincentivize North Korea from peaceful resolution.  Our adherence to binding agreements is the bedrock of our international standing. With that eroded, our ability to bring Kim Jong Un to the bargaining table is lessened, and armed conflict becomes more likely.    I sincerely hope that the President, who has put so much stock in surrounding himself with great military strategists, will heed their advice and stay the course on the JCPOA for a safer world.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-plans-to-declare-that-iran-nuclear-deal-is-not-in-the-national-interest/2017/10/05/825c916e-a9e3-11e7-b3aa-c0e2e1d41e38_story.html?utm_term=.faf27b3b7288","washingtonpost.com",55,44,19,1,0,7,2,65

The bipartisan agreement announced by Senate HELP Committee Leadership to reverse President Trump’s decision to defund cost-sharing reductions is a good place to start. Without action, the cost burden from ending these subsides would fall on the rest of the health insurance market, increasing premiums and raising the deficit by $194 billion over the next 10 years.

True, comprehensive tax reform that helps the middle class and simplifies the tax code to help American businesses compete globally and hire more American workers is desperately needed. However, we should not greatly increase our deficits and debt for irresponsible tax cuts just because legislators are desperate to pass a bill. We have continued to call for a bipartisan, long-term, balanced approach that demonstrates fiscal responsibility, but this misses the mark.   No one can claim surprise, because we’ve lived for years with this blatant hypocrisy. When it comes to unchecked military spending, tax cuts for the wealthy or subsidies for narrow industry interests, there’s always money to be found or, more accurately, borrowed. But when it’s healthcare, infrastructure investment or education and training programs, the purse strings are drawn tight. We need a combination of smart expenditure on investment and sensible tax policy that promotes growth without giving away the farm.  This budget provides neither. It isn’t even close.   That said, I, and many of my colleagues in the New Democrat Coalition, stand ready to reach across the aisle on actual bipartisan, permanent tax reform that simplifies the code and makes it fairer.  We are also willing to work together to make the hard choices necessary to craft a fiscally responsible budget. But, today, I will not endorse this folly.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/house-budget-blueprint-tax-cut.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0","nytimes.com",79,30,10,2,0,4,2,34

A place of peace and community turned into a nightmare.  Once again, the brave first responders who rushed toward danger deserve our thanks, as the victims and their families deserve our compassion and mourning.   I pledged, after the brutal killing at Pulse in Orlando, to end my silence in the face of the gun violence onslaught. When seemingly every type of open venue – schools, churches, festivals, movie theaters, clubs, everywhere we go for community, friendship or time with our families – has been targeted by this terror, Congress’s silence is more deafening that ever. We must act. We must try something for the sake of all the innocent lives lost and the lives we could still save.      Last week, I introduced a bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal that would, in part, make it harder for individuals subject to temporary protection orders because of domestic violence to buy or possess firearms. I don’t know if it would have made a difference in yesterday’s tragedy, but it might prevent the next one.  Or the one after that.  Or the one after that.  Or the one after that. And just because smart, incremental change can’t prevent every death, doesn’t mean we should throw up our hands in despair. We should work to prevent the dangers we can anticipate, and react to the mistakes of the past to stop as much bloodshed as we can. That is Congress’s job. That is our duty. And we are failing. #nomoresilence","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/us/texas-shooting-church.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-ab-top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0","nytimes.com",76,24,13,3,1,0,17,1

As we head into the holiday shopping season, let’s think of how we may be able to give back to others.   About two weeks ago, my staffer, Alexandra Heller, traveled to Walter Reed Hospital with  Operation Gift Cards. The organization provides gift cards to patients and their families to help them meet basic needs while they are at Walter Reed. Thank you, Operation Gift Cards, Fairfield Fire Department, Stamford Halloween Yacht Club, and Greenwich Military Covenant of Care for participating and donating.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanJimHimes/photos/a.133507633619.110028.85767418619/10155904200288620/?type=3",NA,26,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The law required a prospective handgun buyer to wait five business days while the authorities check on his or her background. The bill is named for James Brady, who served as press secretary for President Ronald Reagan, and was shot in the head by John Hinckley, Jr., during an assassination attempt on President Reagan’s life.   Since taking effect in 1994, the law has blocked more than 3 million gun sales to prohibited purchasers including felons, domestic abusers, and other dangerous individuals. However there are still loops to be closed. People can still buy guns at gun shows in some states without a background check. The ease of access to guns leads to  315 people shot every day – 93 of those people die.    It is a shame that in the most developed nation in the world, people die from a cause that could be prevented if we had the collective stomach to  stand up to the gun lobby and pass common sense gun reform. We owe our citizens this and it is unacceptable that we would choose the right to own a weapon over someone’s right to live. The fight continues.  http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/brady-bill-signed-into-law","link","http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/brady-bill-signed-into-law","history.com",77,6,9,2,0,2,0,0
