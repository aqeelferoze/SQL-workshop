She’s a proud graduate of Bloom High School and will be attending Columbia College Chicago to cinematography.   In addition to her internship, Jasmin works part-time at Columbia College. In her spare time, she loves to volunteer in her community, including the Jones Memorial Community Center in Chicago Heights, Illinois.   In high school, Jasmin held leadership positions in her Drama Department, Senior Class and on the Student Council. She was elected “Mayor of Bloom High School,” which allowed her to serve as a liaison between her peers and Bloom’s superintendent.   After earning her bachelor’s degree, Jasmin plans on cutting a new and inclusive path in the world of film and television. “Working alongside Congresswomen Kelly’s staff has truly been an amazing opportunity for me as an artist,” she said. “It has given me an understanding of the fine art of helping others. The staff members that I’ve worked with have taught me professionalism in all aspects. I was never just an intern in the office; I was treated as an equal. This summer has given me a look at how hard the Congresswoman works to help the communities she represents, which I respect to the highest degree.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/reprobinkelly/photos/a.151485401697545.1073741828.150380975141321/774152366097509/?type=3",NA,57,5,16,19,0,0,0,0
