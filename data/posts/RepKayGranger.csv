In a telephone call with members of the Texas Delegation, Governor Abbott expressed his commitment to continuing to work with the Texas Congressional Delegation and Congressional Leadership to ensure that Texas has the resources needed to recover and rebuild.  The measure includes $11 billion to pay anticipated claims for flood insurance for Texans who are victims of Hurricane Harvey, and an estimated $4 billion for the FEMA disaster relief fund for Texas. The new FEMA funding for Texas will provide direct housing assistance, home repairs, debris removal and public assistance grants to eligible communities to begin repairs of roads, utility work, schools and public buildings.  The flood insurance program is expected to run out of money within weeks – meaning Texas claims would not be paid – and FEMA funding will be exhausted soon due to the faster than expected drawdown to address Hurricane Maria claims.  In addition to the $15 billion, Texas cities will also have access to a $4.9 billion pool for grants for Community Disaster Loans.  These loans help communities with revenue losses due to disasters, so the communities can pay for police and fire protection and other critical local needs during their recovery.  “Our top priority is to make sure money doesn’t run out in the next few weeks for Texas homeowners eager to rebuild their homes, as well as communities counting on FEMA funding for temporary housing, debris removal and infrastructure repairs for roads and schools,” said Representatives John Culberson of Houston, John Carter of Round Rock, and Kay Granger of Fort Worth, chairmen of key Appropriations Committee panels in Congress. “These emergency needs require action right now or a lot of Texans will be hurt. We are keeping our eyes focused on the long term recovery needs for Texas, which could exceed $100 billion and we will continue to work closely with Governor Abbott and our community leaders to secure that funding in the weeks ahead.”  https://kaygranger.house.gov/press-release/texas-delegation-secures-15-billion-disaster-funds-emergency-funding-bill","link","https://kaygranger.house.gov/press-release/texas-delegation-secures-15-billion-disaster-funds-emergency-funding-bill","kaygranger.house.gov",44,16,3,5,0,0,0,1

This legislation is one of the most important pro-Second Amendment measures to have passed the House in recent memory.  The pro-gun bill that passed the House, which I was proud to cosponsor, would allow law-abiding citizens to carry concealed only if they are not federally prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm. Citizens must also carry a valid government-issued photo ID, and be lawfully licensed or otherwise entitled to carry a concealed handgun. Each person would have to follow the laws of the state, county and municipality in which they are carrying concealed.  An overwhelming majority of Americans support concealed carry reciprocity – 73 percent of adults, according to a recent New York Times survey. It’s also backed by the attorneys general of 24 states, including Texas’ Attorney General, Ken Paxton.  Currently, the patchwork of reciprocity laws and agreements between states is confusing and has caused law-abiding citizens to unwittingly break the law and suffer arrest and detention. Even the most careful and knowledgeable concealed carry permit holders find it difficult to navigate the current maze of state and local concealed carry laws.  The Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that “the inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right,” which is “the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.” This fundamental right does not stop at a state’s borders and law-abiding citizens should be able to exercise this right when crossing state lines.  Contrary to what some critics say, if the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act becomes law states would retain their authority to enact time and place restrictions on where people can lawfully carry in the state. In addition, the bill would not make it any easier to buy a gun. It has nothing to do with the purchase of guns. It would not alter access to guns and it would not change the federal law requiring background checks.  This legislation will help protect Texans’ Second Amendment rights, and I was pleased to support it.","status",NA,NA,125,108,20,11,0,0,2,41

These tax cuts will ensure Texans keep more of their hard earned money.  In addition, this legislation not only protects current American jobs but also encourages companies who have moved overseas to come home and bring jobs back to Texas.     The bill nearly doubles the standard tax deduction and reduces loopholes, while preserving important tax breaks such as the teacher tax deduction for classroom expenses. With this bill, the typical family of four earning the median family income of $73,000 will receive a tax cut of $2,059. The bill also expands the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000 for single filers and married couples to help parents with the cost of raising children. It also allows Texans to write off up to $10,000 of their property taxes.  This legislation delivers real relief to businesses by lowering the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, down from 35 percent. In fact, it reduces taxes on small businesses to the lowest they’ve been in 40 years. Businesses will be able to immediately write off the full cost of new equipment to improve operations and enhance the skills of their workers.  There has been a lot of mischaracterization of what this bill does, but the American people will know the truth when they start to see more money in their paychecks as early as February of next year.  Congress has finally delivered on the promise of tax reform, and I am proud to have supported this historic tax bill.”","status",NA,NA,256,214,30,38,10,2,7,133
