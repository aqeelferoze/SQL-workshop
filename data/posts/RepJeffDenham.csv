Katherine Clark in reintroducing the Pet and Women Safety (PAWS) Act - a bicameral, bipartisan bill to assist domestic violence survivors and their pets. Multiple studies have shown that domestic abusers often seek to manipulate or intimidate their victims by threatening or harming their pets, yet only 3% of domestic violence shelters across the country accept pets. The result is that victims of domestic violence are held captive emotionally while their beloved pets are used as pawns to prolong an abusive relationship. We must make it possible for women to break free knowing that their pets will be able to move with them wherever they go. I applaud those shelters and programs that have already worked to accommodate pets, and I will continue pushing with my colleagues for a nationwide standard.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJeffDenham/photos/a.135725576493650.27770.133714040028137/1301045073295022/?type=3",NA,45,15,12,8,0,1,1,0

The lowering of marginal tax rates means Americans will receive more money in their paychecks immediately, and at minimum, the first $12,000 to $24,000 of their paychecks will be tax-free. This is a win for the Valley and for everyone who will see an increase in their paychecks in 2018. But the biggest issue in the Valley has always been jobs. This bill will expand exports on the many things we grow in our community, which will allow our local agricultural businesses to be more globally competitive and hire more of our neighbors.
