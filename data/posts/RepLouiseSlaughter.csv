I have been outspoken in my opposition to the president’s executive orders on women’s reproductive rights, a border wall estimated to cost $15 to $25 billion, and the immigration restrictions impacting refugees. Likewise, I’ve expressed support when justified – namely, the withdrawal from a 12-country trade deal I believe would hurt the people I represent. When asked, 70% of you indicated that you have serious concerns about the current administration and 20% said that you are positive and hopeful for the future given the president’s leadership. This is a troubling ratio, and one that I believe he must address.

What’s worse, the president’s senior advisers for policy and homeland security, as well as the heads of the domestic policy, national economic, and national trade councils are all men.

Eric said that before the ACA, he was often faced with patients who had no health insurance and who he knew would be bankrupted by the cost of their care once bills from the hospital finally arrived. With the ACA, Eric saw improvements like fewer uninsured patients, better quality plans, and progression toward integrated and accountable health care systems.

Despite a lot of talk, it seems fiscal discipline is not a priority for Congressional Republicans.     Additionally, in order to bring these measures to the floor, House Republicans completely ignored the Congressional Budget Act and their own budget rules.    Cost Ignored: $20 Million   According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), H.R. 1009, which undermines the independence and authority of federal agencies, will cost taxpayers $20 million dollars.  Yet the Rules Committee put on a legislative blindfold and ignored the cost.     Cost Ignored: $30 Million   The second bill this week, H.R. 998, puts corporate profits before the health and safety of the American public and will cost taxpayers $30 million dollars according to the CBO. Again, the Republican-controlled Rules Committee waived a magic money wand to ignore the cost.     Below is a list of the many budget rules that House Republicans chose to completely ignore in order to pass their partisan legislation.    -Section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act, which prohibits consideration of legislation providing new budget authority in excess of a 302(a) allocation of such authority;   -Section 303 of the Congressional Budget Act, which prohibits consideration of legislation providing new budget authority or a change in revenues for a fiscal year until the budget resolution for that year has been agreed to;  -Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, which prohibits consideration of legislation that would cause revenues to be less than the level of total revenues for the first fiscal year or for the total of that first fiscal year and the ensuing fiscal years for which allocations are provided;  -Clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII, which requires the inclusion of a committee cost estimate.  - Clause 10 of rule XXI, which prohibits the consideration of a bill if it has the net effect of increasing mandatory spending over the five-year or ten-year period.  Congressional Republicans like to talk a lot about fiscal discipline but when it comes to paying for their partisan agenda they have no problem exempting themselves from the Congressional Budget Act and their own budget rules.

Next Thursday, May 4, is the last chance for young artists across Western New York to submit their work to the 35th annual Congressional Arts Competition. As co-chair of the Congressional Arts Caucus and lifelong advocate of the arts, I always enjoy seeing the work submitted by talented young artists from Monroe County. Last year’s winning piece, “Hemispheres,” has proudly hung in the halls of Congress for a year and now it’s time for a new piece to take its place. Submissions are even judged by a panel of local experts from the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester's Creative Workshop!

The United States currently ranks 138th of 172 nations in voter turnout, mostly because our Election Day falls smack in the middle of the workweek. We decided to vote on Tuesday in 1845 when we were an agrarian society. Times have changed. The number one reason Americans give for not voting is that they are too busy or just can’t get time off work. France, Germany, Thailand, and Japan are just some of the countries that have moved to holding their elections on the weekend, contributing to significantly higher turnout rates. That’s why I wrote the Weekend Voting Act, which would move Election Day to the first Saturday and Sunday after the first Friday in November.

This morning, we talked about everything from infrastructure investments to health care, and the steps we need to take to protect New York’s best interests under the current administration. Although we serve in different capitals, the governor and our congressional delegation have an obligation and an opportunity to partner together and move our state forward. Our delegation has a long history of getting things done for New York – even in the most challenging political environments – and today’s discussion was a continuation of those efforts.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepLouiseSlaughter/photos/a.10150095295662701.276799.82424647700/10155064551267701/?type=3",NA,55,7,2,4,0,0,0,0

The United Nations Security Council approved it unanimously and all of the experts tell us today it remains our best path forward to continuing to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.

The president’s decision to withhold certification of this deal will only hand Iran a victory and make China’s cooperation in dealing with the North Korea far less likely. It should be deeply concerning not only to Congress but to our international allies that the president has moved to decertify this deal even over objections from his own Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

At a time when the cost of education is soaring nationwide, this bill will eliminate the student loan interest tax deduction that helps make getting a college degree more affordable. These cuts raise $65 billion off the backs of our students and young graduates just to give the wealthy a tax cut they don’t need. Even a deduction teachers rely on when using their own money to equip their classrooms would be eliminated. The repeal of the state and local tax deduction would also be devastating for our schools. An analysis by the National Education Association found that eliminating SALT would put nearly 24,628 education jobs at risk in New York alone and cut $250 billion in education funding nationwide over the next ten years. I stand with our local schools, teachers, and students who understand that this bill robs resources instead of investing in our future.","link","http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2017/11/16/gop-tax-plan-colleges-schools-rochester-salt/870790001/","democratandchronicle.com",47,14,21,0,0,1,5,26

Ken is descended from not one but two of the most important names in American history: he is also the great-great grandson of Booker T. Washington. Amazing! The life and legacy of Frederick Douglass is so important to our nation. That’s why I’m so proud that he is one of Rochester’s own and was one the few men to attend the Seneca Falls Convention. Just like his ancestors, Ken is helping lead the way to educate young people about our nation’s history and the importance of equality for all.
