Earlier last month, I joined Congressman Mike Turner (OH-10) and Congresswoman Niki Tsongas (MA-3) to introduce TREAT Act.  This bill aims to expand access to substance abuse treatment in prisons. In addition, I will re-introduce The Breaking Addiction Act, to allow States to apply for waivers and increase the number of drug abuse patients that can be served through Medicaid. We all play a role in combating drug abuse and reversing the effects of these deadly substances in our communities.

H.R. 1 is a partisan bill, which will raise taxes on millions of low and middle income families and increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion to give tax cuts to their corporate and wealthy individual donors.  I voted no because this bill would devastate millions of working families for generations. I could not vote for a bill that makes tax cuts permanent for corporations, while only giving temporary relief for some, not all, American families.  My Republican colleagues should be ashamed for ramming through such a partisan bill. From the very beginning, this entire process has been a sham. There were no public hearings.  There was no open debate. When Congress tackled our tax code 31 years ago, it was done in an open, bipartisan manner, not behind closed doors. It is time for Congress to return to regular order and get back to work on bipartisan solutions that benefit hardworking middle class families, not just the wealthiest few. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/16/the-house-is-voting-on-its-tax-bill-thursday-heres-what-is-in-it/?utm_term=.2594a017992f","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/16/the-house-is-voting-on-its-tax-bill-thursday-heres-what-is-in-it/?utm_term=.2594a017992f","washingtonpost.com",65,39,57,1,0,1,13,61

This Continuing Resolution provides only temporary relief for the nearly nine million children depending on the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and health care providers working tirelessly at our Community Health Centers.  House Republicans wasted another opportunity to work with Democrats in a bipartisan way on behalf of millions of children and their families.  I would have supported a bill that addressed the needs of the hardworking Americans that sent us to Congress; a bill that provided stable reauthorization and funding for CHIP and Community Health Centers, funding to combat the opioid epidemic, stabilized the health insurance marketplace, protected DREAMers, and addressed the pension crisis.  Today, House Republicans also put forth a supplemental disaster relief funding package that does nothing to guarantee help for our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This is a bill the Senate is not expected to consider until 2018. People without homes or electricity in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Texas, Florida, and California cannot wait. Rather than spending valuable time passing a tax cut that predominately benefits the wealthiest Americans, we should have been working to protect sick children and disaster victims. We should be voting on things that will affect people’s lives now.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/after-passing-tax-overhaul-gop-returns-to-infighting-as-shutdown-deadline-looms/2017/12/21/dfad1890-e659-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html?utm_term=.731811653f2d","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/after-passing-tax-overhaul-gop-returns-to-infighting-as-shutdown-deadline-looms/2017/12/21/dfad1890-e659-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html?utm_term=.731811653f2d","washingtonpost.com",34,16,11,4,1,1,1,1

It is time for the NPHC to take the lead and exert their power both individually and collectively in the governance arena.
