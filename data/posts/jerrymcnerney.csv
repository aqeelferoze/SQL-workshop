It has increased access to health care in this country by eliminating pre-existing condition exclusions, setting caps on out-of-pocket costs and ensuring families no longer face the threat of bankruptcy due to illness or medical emergencies. The ACA also lowers prescription drug costs for seniors and prevents insurance companies from charging women more for health coverage.  I oppose efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  The law is not perfect, but repealing the ACA will shock our health care system, causing millions of people to lose their coverage and costing thousands of lost jobs in my district alone.  Instead of wasting time and resources to repeal a law that benefits millions of people, we should work together to make improvements and build on the progress we’ve made.  https://mcnerney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-mcnerney-issues-statement-opposing-efforts-to-repeal-the-affordable","link","https://mcnerney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-mcnerney-issues-statement-opposing-efforts-to-repeal-the-affordable","mcnerney.house.gov",161,29,32,23,0,0,1,6

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices creates immense opportunities for our society, including new jobs and efficiencies in all aspects of our everyday lives. However, the security of these devices has not kept up with the rapid pace of innovation and deployment. Security vulnerabilities in IoT devices are likely to pose threats to our national security and endanger our nation’s economy. My legislation helps to address these concerns by requiring that security standards be established for IoT devices and that these devices be certified to meet those standards.","status",NA,NA,50,7,3,2,0,0,0,0

Despite a loud cry from the American people that they want to be able to choose how their information is used, this law leaves consumers without the power to choose how their internet service provider (ISP) uses and shares their information. It also leaves consumers more vulnerable to cyber attacks because ISPs will no longer be required to take reasonable steps to secure consumers’ personal information. Given the growing cyber threats that our nation faces, it is critical that we do more, not less, to secure consumers’ data. I will continue to fight for strong online privacy and security protections for consumers.

In January, U.S. Intelligence agencies concluded with high confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at undermining the U.S. presidential election, and there is growing evidence that Trump’s campaign aides had frequent contact with Russian officials before, during, and after the election.   Many of my colleagues and I have called for a special prosecutor or an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate any ties between President Trump and Russia. An investigation is essential to upholding the integrity of our democracy and our national security.

President Trump and his advisors are pushing policies that are threatening the safety and well-being of every American, and of future generations around the world.

This bill guts the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) Prevention and Public Health Fund––crucial funding for preventing and treating chronic diseases. Our district relies heavily on these resources to keep our children healthy, but Republicans are slashing these vital funds in yet another attempt to sabotage the ACA. Unfortunately, they are using the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) reauthorization, which has always been a bipartisan issue, to take core public health services away from children in need. It is critical that we reauthorize CHIP and community health centers, but we cannot do so by cutting essential funding and hurting our children.","video","https://www.facebook.com/jerrymcnerney/videos/1905483866152632/",NA,153,33,18,10,0,1,8,8

I told the story of a trip Mary and I took to the Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve. It’s a former coal field in my district with a graveyard on top of the hill. One day, Mary and I decided to hike up to that graveyard, where we saw the stones of those former miners and their families who dedicated their lives to making this a great country. As we were walking back down, thinking about the sacrifice those miners made, we looked out across the Delta and saw a magnificent sight: huge windmills turning slowly in the breeze. They were creating energy, but we also knew that they were creating new jobs and new opportunities. I’ll never forget that moment as we looked out on a beautiful view from the past to the future.
