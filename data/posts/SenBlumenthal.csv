For millions of Americans, it has been the difference between financial security or bankruptcy. It has been the difference between seeing a doctor at the first signs of disease or waiting until it has spread too far for treatment. It has been the difference – for many – between life and death.    One woman wrote to me that her brother developed cancer when he was just 23. He is one of the 25,000 young people in Connecticut who have been able to stay on their parents’ plan, and thanks to that provision, he received the care he needed without going bankrupt.    I heard from a father whose daughter has Crohn’s disease. He asked me to tell politicians hoping to repeal the law that health insurance is “not a luxury, but a necessity” for his family.    I spoke with a woman who told me that before the ACA, her medications cost $250,000. Thanks to the health reform law, she has affordable health care, no lifetime caps, and knows she won’t be denied coverage because of her pre-existing condition.    As Republicans attempt to repeal ACA, I’ve been searching for how I can best capture what this law means to Americans. It isn’t through a statistic. It isn’t through rhetoric. It’s through you. It’s through these stories you have shared with me about how the law has helped your families. I challenge my colleagues who want to repeal this law to listen to listen to your constituents, and do not deny them health care.","status",NA,NA,327,78,56,25,1,3,9,2

At his confirmation hearing, Senator Sessions said simply that he would follow the law. But the Attorney General of the United States must be more than a follower. He must be a leader committed to fighting for civil rights and liberties and the active pursuit of justice.  Senator Sessions has failed to convince me that he will be a champion of constitutional rights: voting rights, women’s health care and privacy rights, and anti-discrimination protections. Rather, he has demonstrated hostility and antipathy – even downright opposition – to these bedrock Constitutional principles. He has prided himself on his vociferous opposition to comprehensive immigration reform – legislation that passed the Senate with 68 bipartisan votes. He staunchly opposed a criminal justice reform bill that has attracted a group of 25 cosponsors, Democrats and Republicans. He even split with the majority of his own party to vote against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Indeed, his career demonstrates a prevailing hostility to the very rights and liberties that the nation’s chief law enforcement officer must always promote and defend.

I'm joining my wife, Cynthia, three of our four children, thousands from Connecticut and many more from around the country, to stand and march together for causes and values critical to our nation's future. They are truly American values—like civil rights and liberties, equal justice under law, women's ‎health care, good jobs and economic opportunity for all. They are all threatened. In the tradition of Martin Luther King, whose birthday we just celebrated and whose own march ignited and inspired America, we move forward together in solidarity. Bridging differences of race, religion, gender, national origin, sexual identity, culture, and political affiliation—we raise our voices together in the Capitol's shadow. We know our diversity makes us stronger.

She evaded questions about dedicating resources to learning and bringing accountability to schools – but refused to commit to keeping guns out of our classrooms. And the fact that she didn’t even know that the statutory protection regarding discrimination against children with disabilities is a matter of federal law shows you something about her commitment to equal opportunity in education across the country. Her statements at the hearing are backed up by her dismal record in Michigan, where she advocated for an expansion of failing for-profit charter schools that under performed while siphoning money from already underfunded public school systems. Our students deserve better, and as lawmakers, we should demand better. That’s why I’ll be voting against Betsy DeVos.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenBlumenthal/videos/1395131183850567/",NA,3235,500,459,382,1,5,5,33

Such refugees have already undergone extensive vetting and have a close connection with a U.S. government-approved organization which can vouch for them. They are, in short, exactly the kind of individuals who are protected by the Supreme Court’s order earlier this week, which strikes down the ban for all refugees with a ‘credible claim’ to a legitimate relationship with individuals or entities here.   The Administration is turning away Americans’ family members in direct and clear violation of the Supreme Court’s order. To take just one example, the State Department has said it will not provide visas to the fiancés of U.S. citizens if they would be blocked by the Executive Order, even though the Supreme Court said explicitly that fiancés are protected.  Once again, the Trump Administration is preparing to roll out a travel ban with no consultation and minimal forethought and respect for the law.

Millions of Americans would be forced to live with the completely inadequate, second-class coverage proposed by this bill – a plan that would further sabotage the healthcare exchanges and fracture the markets. Basic, preventative healthcare coverage, including maternity care and mental healthcare, would be jeopardized by this bill. Planned Parenthood, a health provider that brings millions of women and men both care and peace of mind, would be cruelly defunded for political purposes.

Conner has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an illness that slowly erodes motor functions. As it progresses, he will lose the ability to run, walk, or hug his parents goodnight. Unless a cure is found, it will one day take his life. But you’d never know it from the courage and strength he brings to each day, much like his incredible, hardworking family.   This summer, just before the last Republican scheme to gut the Affordable Care Act failed, Conner’s parents installed stair lifts in their home. You can imagine the infectious smile on Conner’s face as he tried it out – not fully grasping the reason for its necessity, but enjoying his newfound freedom to be a kid.   Conner’s mother wrote that their experience underscored just how vital Medicaid is to their family. As Conner gets older, he will need more and more help to maintain his quality of life. He will need a loving and compassionate healthcare system that will protect him when he is at his most vulnerable. That’s his only hope for a fair chance at life.  Graham/Cassidy, to put it mildly, deprives him of that chance.   I wonder if my Republican colleagues could look Conner or his parents in the eye and explain why protections for kids with preexisting conditions should be eviscerated – or why the funds they’ve proposed to replace Medicaid, the program that could one day make a life or death difference for him – should run out in 10 years. I wonder if they realize the havoc this bill would wreak on families facing similar worries in their own states.   This moment asks us to consider what kind of country we really are. I know we are better than a system that turns its back on kids like Conner and forces families to make an impossible choice between their children’s health and their finances.

This massive giveaway to special interests and the wealthiest is fundamentally unfair and fiscally irresponsible. Republicans’ hastily assembled would-be overhaul shifts the tax burden directly onto the backs of the middle class.   This proposal overwhelmingly favors the wealthiest Americans, while condemning the middle class to generations of debt repayment. It repeals the state and local tax deduction, devastating Connecticut families who save thousands each year and communities that benefit from the support it provides for local services. It eliminates the student loan interest deduction, throwing graduates already drowning in debt further under the bus. It even eliminates the adoption tax credit – targeting new families during a monumental transition. And it rewards companies for shifting their operations overseas, where their active income will no longer be taxed.  Even the credits Republicans claim benefit working families are paltry – the expanded child tax credit would be cancelled out for many by the elimination of personal exemptions. True tax reform would help all Americans get ahead.

Our commonsense bill will bolster public safety protections that could mean the difference between life and death. By incentivizing states and holding federal agencies accountable for building robust background check reporting systems, we can prevent gun sales to people who are a danger to themselves or others – including convicted domestic abusers. In so doing, we will begin to close the gaping loophole that allowed mass murderers in Sutherland Springs, Charleston, and Blacksburg to obtain the firearms used to commit their crimes.   While more must be done to defeat the scourge of gun violence, the Fix NICS Act represents a crucial step forward. I am grateful for the bipartisan coalition that has united behind this much-needed reform, and hopeful that the Senate will pass it and confront this crisis with action.","status",NA,NA,282,76,23,22,10,1,0,7
