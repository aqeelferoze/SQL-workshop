I look forward to meeting with General Kelly tomorrow to discuss next steps.

In that memo, I urged Trump to go after the real enemy‚Äîradical Islamist terrorists‚Äîand explained how we could improve screening to keep terrorists out.

We must remain clear-eyed about the threats we face. Islamist terror has been franchised to followers not only in strongholds like Iraq and Syria, but in all corners of the world, and they are using everything from sophisticated explosives to their own vehicles to kill innocent people. We must intensify our efforts to deny these terrorists safe havens abroad, while more aggressively countering jihadist radicalization efforts here in the United States.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/michaeltmccaul/photos/a.452030959859.250495.6355254859/10155163423294860/?type=3",NA,13,10,8,0,1,2,1,3

While the U.S. would prefer a political rather than a military solution to this conflict, the fact remains that you cannot negotiate with tyrants. Passiveness in Syria is what has exacerbated this situation and allowed for adversaries such as Russia and Iran to exert their influence at the expense of U.S. national security, all the while allowing ISIS to flourish.

For years, my constituents have asked me to work to repeal and replace Obamacare, and I promised them I would.  Today, I kept that promise to my constituents and to the American people.   I ultimately voted in support of the American Healthcare Act (AHCA) because it begins to crumble the foundation Obamacare stands on by ending the individual mandate and cutting taxes that have financially burdened hardworking Americans for years.  My vote for the AHCA is the first step towards building a stronger foundation for our nation‚Äôs healthcare system.  We need a market-based, patient-centered approach designed to provide affordable and accessible healthcare for all Americans. It must empower the American people to make their own choices instead of allowing unelected bureaucrats in Washington to make it for them.   As the founder of the Childhood Cancer Caucus, I am proud to note that the AHCA provides safeguards for people with pre-existing conditions.  The bill will provide states with the flexibility to lower health insurance premium prices through a waiver that will only be given to states with high-risk pools and other protections in place.  For states seeking a waiver, this bill also provides an additional $8 billion ‚Äì bringing the total amount of funds to $138 billion ‚Äì to allow people with pre-existing conditions who haven‚Äôt maintained continuous coverage to acquire affordable care.   I look forward to continuing to work with the President and my colleagues in Congress to make good on our promise to provide affordable, accessible, and quality health care to all Americans.","status",NA,NA,275,1075,93,20,3,4,45,800
