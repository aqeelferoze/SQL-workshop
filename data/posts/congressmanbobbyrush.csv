Rush (DL-IL01) issued the following statement during an Energy Subcommittee Hearing on “Modernizing Energy and Electricity Delivery Systems: Challenges and Opportunities to Promote Infrastructure Improvement and Expansion,” where he serves as Ranking Member. The congressman noted that the federal government must embark on a path of upgrading the nation’s energy infrastructure that it is done “in a way that is responsible, environmentally-conscious, and takes into account the rights and interests of impacted communities.”  Reading from a letter from the National Urban League, Rep. Rush questioned the first panel on the level of employment, business and entrepreneurial opportunities for African Americans and other minorities. ““My office received a letter from the National Urban League, which in part noted the importance of job training and workforce development programs as an essential component of any comprehensive infrastructure proposal,” he said. “Specifically, the letter discussed the necessity for including technical training, pre-apprenticeships, internships and job placement opportunities for African Americans and other minority communities as a way to ensure that all Americans are able to fully benefit in the tremendous opportunities before us. “  Legislators heard testimony from Ganesh Bell, chief digital officer of GE Power; Dr. Michael Howard, president and CEO of Electric Power Research Institute; Lonnie Stephenson, international president of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; Steven G. Hauser, CEO of GridWise Alliance; Chad Harrison, Councilman-at-large of Standing Rock Sioux Tribe; Rex Ferry, owner of Valley Electrical Consolidated; Kim Kann, private landowner from Lancaster County, PA; Terry O’Sullivan, general president of Laborers International Union of North America; and Joey Mahmoud, project director of Dakota Access Pipeline. “I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this important hearing today on the challenges and opportunities associated with improving our nation’s energy infrastructure,” Rush’  “Mr. Chairman, this is a timely hearing and it is my hope that we can follow up on the bipartisan agreement that was initiated last session as part of the comprehensive energy bill that ultimately fell through.   “As part of those discussions, Mr. Chairman, there are two provisions in particular that I hope we can bring to fruition this time around, specifically, the pipeline safety replacement program that would provide assistance to low income communities that I have been promoting.   “Additionally, I hope that we can come together and agree to invest in modernizing the nation’s aging electrical grid infrastructure, as Ranking Member Pallone has been advocating for.   “Mr. Chairman, it is also important that as we embark on this path of upgrading our nation’s energy infrastructure that we do so in a way that is responsible, environmentally-conscious, and takes into account the rights and interests of impacted communities.   “Even as we speak, Mr. Chairman, we are seeing the impact of shoddily built infrastructure in the tragedy playing out in California, where almost 200 thousand residents have been evacuated due to leaks in an emergency spillway at the Oroville Dam.   “Sadly, Mr. Chairman, this entire episode could have been avoided if builders and regulators had taken heed to the warnings of environmental groups who had forewarned of the risk of catastrophic flooding more than a decade ago, but who were unfortunately ignored.   “Indeed Mr. Chairman, it is important to remember that while some may consider commonsense safety and environmental regulations to be overly burdensome or tedious, these protections may one day be the difference in saving one’s property, livelihood, or even life.   “Another important aspect of today’s hearing will hopefully provide instruction in attempting to strike the right balance between modernizing and upgrading the nation’s energy infrastructure, like we so desperately need, while also taking into account the rights of landowners, Native Americans, and other communities that might be adversely impacted by these types of projects.   “Mr. Chairman, nowhere is this struggle more pronounced than in the battle over the Dakota Access Pipeline, as we will hear from our second panel of witnesses.   “As policymakers, we all understand the need for additional infrastructure to ensure that critical fuels and resources are carried to the places where they are needed in order to meet our nation’s energy demands.   “However, as Representatives of the people we must also ensure that the rights and interests of Native Americans, property-owners, and less affluent communities are also protected.   “Mr. Chairman, Congress should help provide thoughtful and responsible guidance for instituting a fair and balanced process for moving forward with large-scale energy projects that respect the rights of all communities and does not place expedience or maximum profit above the rights of landowners or the communities these projects traverse.   “So Mr. Chairman, I welcome all of today’s witnesses and I look forward to a rigorous debate on these important and sometimes difficult issues…”  -30-","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmanbobbyrush/photos/a.401417916536790.103175.230753786936538/1588043051207598/?type=3",NA,10,1,6,0,0,0,0,0

Rush","2017-02-22","2017-02-22 22:32:53","CHICAGO –In an effort to bring more accountability to police departments across the country today U.S. Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-IL01) has introduced H.R. 1213 “Laquan McDonald Camera Act of 2017” which requires, as a condition on the receipt of federal funds, that law enforcement agencies o have in effect a policy regarding the use of body-worn and dashboard cameras.  The legislation is named for a 17-year-old youth whose October 2014 killing by a Chicago police officer stunned the city and opened a Pandora’s Box of questions about the training and policies of the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Dashboard cameras on the night of the incident were disabled or not working properly. The bill seeks to penalize any law enforcement agency not in compliance by stripping them of 10 percent of federal funding unless certification is provided to the U.S. Attorney General that policies are in place and being enforced.  “This legislation seeks to restore some of the public’s trust in law enforcement at time when trust is at an all-time low. There has been a wave of questionable police shootings that resulted in the deaths of unarmed citizens — or people who appeared to be of no threat at the time of the encounter,” said Rush. “Cases, such as Laquan McDonald, Mike Brown, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile are brutal illustrations on why we need a clear documentation of facts when citizen-encounters with police turn deadly.  “What’s the point of having body-cams or dashboard cameras if a cop fails to turn them on or the volume is off,” Rush said. “Having clear, enforceable policies protects both citizens and law enforcement officers when these incidents escalate.”  Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division released a scathing investigative report on the Chicago Police Department. It found reasonable cause to believe that CPD engages in a pattern or practice of using force, including deadly force, in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S.  Constitution. The Department found that CPD officers’ practices unnecessarily endanger themselves and result in unnecessary and avoidable uses of force. The pattern or practice results from systemic deficiencies in training and accountability, including the failure to train officers in de-escalation and the failure to conduct meaningful investigations of uses of force.  To be in compliance with the “Laquan McDonald Camera Act,” a State shall require each law enforcement agency of that State and of a unit of a local government of that State to have in effect a policy requiring and prescribing the conditions for the use of body-worn cameras and dashboard cameras by law enforcement officers of that agency, and to establish procedures providing for the effective enforcement of that policy.-30-","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmanbobbyrush/photos/a.401417916536790.103175.230753786936538/1597090913636145/?type=3",NA,16,9,5,0,0,0,0,0

Rush","2017-02-24","2017-02-24 22:26:54","I want to address the misinformation being spread by some individuals affiliated with a new organization that says its designed to challenge the Trump administration and its policies. On yesterday, I was notified by staff that a small group people were gathering in front of the office, with some carrying signs about the EPA, Bannon and my voting record. I instructed them to be cordial as they arrived as it is within every American's right to exercise free speech and non violent peaceful protest.  As the group assembled, staff reported that some people identified themselves as members of ""Indivisible,"" and because some staff members were familiar and/or supporters of this organization, they were enthused they were now visible in the District. I was told the people had constituent forms and wanted to turn them. I instructed staff to let the constituents know that I would be happy to meet with them and personally receive the forms--and I was on my way after I was able to obtain someone to sit with my wife. It is no secret I am on leave from the House and have been for some time, since I am my wife's primary caregiver--and  I make no apologies to anyone for this.   As a person whose entire life was built on protest, advocacy, free speech and tackling the programs and policies of those in power, I welcomed the opportunity to hear their concerns as well as share what I am doing to protect our interests against the Trump agenda.  After a staff member met with the a man named Jeff who identified himself as the  leader of ""Indivisible"" in the 1st Congressional District, he worked with her to inform the people assembled to get in a single file line so people could individually deliver their form to inside the office.   [Please note, this is not the first time, Jeff has met with my office. He had an extensive conversation with my Senior Constituent Services Assistant and said that he was new to Illinois and had sought work as an ""actor."" He had tried to move in Hyde Park but decided to move into West Beverly instead.]   However, on this day, Jeff, who said he was the leader of Indivisible in the 1st CD, and others wanted to know ""what time"" I was arriving, of which that was unknown, since I was working to get someone to be with Carolyn. When the staff member went to instruct the other colleagues inside of the District office of the process, someone from the Indivisible group began loudly banging on the glass door (which is always locked for security reasons) which therefore triggered my chief-of-staff to follow federal protocol and contact Capitol Police. Staff was then instructed by federal officials to not allow anyone into the building because of security concerns.  In the meantime, as I am waiting on a trusted individual to relieve me so I can hop on the expressway and arrive as quickly as I can to the office to meet with my constituents, I was alerted that two intruders (pictured below) had reportedly gone in the alley behind the office building, climbed the stairwell and somehow entered my office through an unmarked backdoor. Two female staff members were standing there, afraid, not knowing whose these men were---one of whom had his hands in his pockets. Neither said anything, I am told, until a courageous staffer asked them ""What are you doing in here? How did you get in here? Who are you,"" to which I am told one of the young men (as seen on the right) indicated he was ""looking for a bathroom."" He was allowed in the bathroom as the two employees locked themselves in the office and called federal authorities--as they should have. Another staff went to the bathroom, opened the door and told the man he was trespassing and he would have to leave. I'm told he and the other intruder left peacefully.  In the meantime, most of the constituents and demonstrators assembled had continued their protest by posting their constituent forms on the windows of the District Office. I'm told they then left the premises--and, again,  talking to staff, who'd, gone outside to ask them to wait for my arrival, but many indicated they needed to get to work. I arrived around 11 am and only three of the people were left---Jeff, and the two men, who was quickly identified by staff as the intruders who had broke into my second floor office through an alleyway.   After some pleasantries--and my taking a moment to talk to people who were driving by and wanted to know if everything was okay haven seen the group of demonstrators earlier--I invited the three me into my office and had a very long talk with them.   1. I listened to their concerns. All of them. Chief among them was my absenteeism; second was they wanted me to vote in support of or against various pieces of recent legislation. I listened and did not interrupt. Jeff did most of the talking. When they were finished I responded.  2. My response, in short was to the legislation---I had already co-sponsored every bill they claimed I had not did anything on. And, as far as one piece of legislation about the attacks on the EPA, they did not seem to know that I was the one who had been leading the charge to protect the EPA for the past 8 years.  3. One of the intruders, who later identified himself only  as a ""Hyde Park constituent by zip code 60615, and did not want to give his name, wanted to know what I thought about Steve Bannon on the NSC. I told them I did not think it was a good idea---but I also explained that a president has the legal authority to hire who he wants and our focus shouldn't be on ONE individual but ALL of them as a matter of policy and ideology.   4. I then addressed Jeff's direct questions about my voting record, which I admit hasn't been good since Carolyn took ill. I explained for some time why that was. I was sincere, candid and open. I told them if it came down to choosing my job or my wife I would always choose my wife. I told them, it is my moral obligation and my spiritual obligation. I explained to them that I made the wrong choice in 1999 when my son Huey was shot. At the time, we wer told by doctors he would most likely pull thru. I believe in my God and I believed what the doctors said. I had an urgent vote---and I made the decision to leave my son in critical condition, in intensive care, to fly to Washington, D.C. to make that vote. And it wasn't two minutes after casting that vote that I got the call that my son had taken a turn for the worse. As you all know...he died. This has been something that is struck my heart and spirit for many days. I blamed myself. Even though that was foolishness, I want you to understand how I felt. I told Jeff, show stared at me like I wasn't saying anything, that I would not make that mistake with Carolyn.  5. After all of that, my candidness, my openness and even showing that I agreed with 95 percent of everything they were concerned with in federal government, Jeff still looked at me and said he wanted me to resign. He said I should go be with my wife. The other fellow spoke up and asked me if I had an idea when I might do that (meaning resign). I think I was struck by the coldness of this statement---and the lack of compassion, though they said they understood---but I answered anyway. I basically said it was my and my family's decision to make.   6. The meeting concluded with pleasantries and well wishes---and Jeff telling me he and other members of Indivisible would be in attendance at the Immigration Forum later that evening.  The guys apologized for taping all of the constituent forms on the doors and windows. They said they'd take them down and since my staff had already done most of it--Jeff and the two guys went outside and started removing all of the tape from the windows and doors. I thanked them and told them to come back anytime---and to bring the others. They told me they supported me and it seemed we had come to an understand. We could disagree on some things without being disagreeable.   7. As they removed the tape from the District Office windows, I then had a brief interview with a Tribune reporter who was embedded with them but had to wait in the lobby until my meeting with my constituents were over. You can find the Tribune report online. He mentions that I did not share with them Indivisible's concerns about my voting record--nor did this reporter ask me a question about it. (This is also recorded by my staff--along with the meeting with Jeff and the two men who invaded my office.)  8. I was fully aware that Jeff, his two friends, and his followers would be at the town hall meeting that night--I welcomed them as I looked forward to a spirited discussion about Trump's immigration plans. What I was not prepared for was that  it appeared Jeff and his two followers had not been communicated with regarding the meeting. It seems they were told I ""showed up after they left"" as if I sat in a car peeping around the corner waiting for them to drive away. It is this misinformation that stings. I have faced death in ways that is well documented and I have no fear of talking to the people I represent in Congress, whether they voted for me or not.  But it seemed to me they didn't really want to hear about what I was going to do to fight Trump---some of them had one agenda---get rid of Bobby Rush. And, maybe they thought that if they yelled at me long enough and hard enough that I'd pick up my hat and go home. (You can view that Q&A on my YouTube channel).  9. I serve a Mighty God and a mighty people---many of whom live in my congressional District. I have been a public servant since I was 16 years old. I've made mistakes. I've led the charge. But all the time I've been honest and willing to take the hits along with the praise.   I am sharing these reflections because it is disheartening to me that people who claim to ""be on my side"" would misrepresent an important discussion to people who are sincerely worried about what the Trump administration will do. They demand representation--and I am doing so. My office is engaged and I am active. I just cannot travel to Washington, as much as I'd like, because of my commitment to my wife. I love her dearly. And I love the people.   I look forward to working with this group and any other that is engaged in non-violent advocacy to better the lives of others. Sneaking in an alleyway and entering doors and startling staffers who are only doing what's been instructed of them is not productive to the cause--and could have caused hurt and danger to those involved.    I plan to hold Trump's feet to the fire, as you hold my feet to the fire. I expect no less. I do not expect anyone to be quiet because of this social media posts or because of what I've shared above. You must advocate. You must be strong. You must fight for a better America --for all of us.   But understand, I will not be bullied or bowed.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmanbobbyrush/photos/a.401417916536790.103175.230753786936538/1599352020076701/?type=3",NA,40,38,16,1,0,7,0,2

Rush (D-IL) wasted no time in inviting President Donald Trump to Chicago as the president made his way to the lectern for his first Joint Session speech before Congress on Tuesday night.  The legislator said the nation’s chief executive agreed to visit the city which has been under a national spotlight after Trump threatened to “send in the feds” to curb violence.  Rep. Rush’s invitation came moments before Trump gave his first speech before a Joint Session of Congress where the Republican detailed a series of administrative objectives that would harm America’s most vulnerable citizens and set the country on a dangerous path. The president also assailed Chicago’s shooting rate by erroneously stating the current had already surpassed last year’s numbers.    “Trump’s speech was nothing more than campaign promises on steroids—and what he said about Chicago is wrong and a bunch of rhetoric,” Rep. Rush said. “Four-thousand people haven’t been shot in the first two months of this year; but even if one person in our city is the victim of this reckless gun violence we need solutions, not more propaganda. I invited him to Chicago so he can talk to leaders, citizens and people who are working to reduce violence—but also to understand the other side of this story, and that’s poverty, joblessness and a lack of access to mental health and social services.  “Trump’s attacks on the Affordable Care Act will render 20 million Americans without access to health care. His attacks on immigrants will only escalate the already growing level of bigotry sweeping the nation. His war on deregulation is really a smokescreen to turn his back on public safety. We should not remove safeguards that oversee protections for the environment, food and drugs, technology and the like,” Rep. Rush said.  The Democrat also noted the address was “more propaganda and less process,” adding, “He speaks in broad generalities and gives very few specifics,” Rep. Rush continued. “He’s good at telling us the what but never the how. He talked about violence but never talked about the easy access to guns. He talked about the killings but didn’t mention straw purchases.  Rep. Rush said one solution is the passage of H.R.810 the “Hadiya Pendleton and Nyasia Pryear-Yard Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act of 2017,” which he introduced in February. The bill seeks to increase public safety by punishing and deterring firearms trafficking. Specifically, it prohibits, with respect to two or more firearms, the transfer to or receipt by a prohibited person or a person who plans a subsequent transfer that results in unlawful use, possession, or disposition of such firearms; providing false statements in connection with the purchase, receipt, or acquisition of such firearms; and directing, promoting, or facilitating such prohibited conduct.  Rep. Rush also spoke to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and asked him to not only re-open the Emmett Till murder case, in light of new information, but also, reverse his decision to possibly table a U.S. Justice Department report on reforms needed in the Chicago Police Department (CPD).   In an effort to bring more accountability to police departments across the country Rep. Rush introduced H.R. 1213, the “Laquan McDonald Camera Act of 2017” which requires, as a condition on the receipt of federal funds, that law enforcement agencies to have in effect a policy regarding the use of body-worn and dashboard cameras.  The legislation is named for a 17-year-old youth whose October 2014 killing by a Chicago police officer stunned the city launched a federal investigation of CPD’s training and policies. Dashboard cameras on the night of the incident were disabled or not working properly. The bill seeks to penalize any law enforcement agency not in compliance by stripping them of 10 percent of federal funding unless certification is provided to the Attorney General that policies are in place and are being enforced. ###  Stephanie A.

Rush (IL) introduced  H.R. 1272 the “Cold Case Record Collections Act of  2017” to help bring justice and closure to unsolved cases stemming from the Civil Rights era.  This act allows for citizens to request certain documents from civil rights cold cases to be declassified. Currently, the classification of these documents prevents private citizens from investigating decades old cases that are still unsolved, and are unlikely to be solved exclusively by federal agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ).   “There are far too many unsolved crimes from the Civil Rights Movement that remain a mystery yet there is critical information found in federal case files,” Rep. Rush said. “Families and people in general deserve to know what has happened to bring closure and justice to those involved.”  Approximately 113 civil rights cold cases remain unsolved. Up until now, almost none of the cold cases solved were done exclusively by federal agencies. Cases that were solved required the help of outside investigators. Additionally, these investigators required access to documents from agencies such as the FBI and DOJ in order to solve their cases. The Cold Case Record Collections Act of 2017 provides a more efficient method of declassifying and releasing such documents to the public. This will, in turn, enable outside investigators to be able to solve cold cases more often as they will have access to more documents.  The Cold Case Record Collections Act of 2017 establishes the following:  • The “Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection” at the National Archives. • An independent agency known as the Cold Case Records Review Board. • Guidelines for the Cold Case Records Review Board to follow. • Rules and requirements for appointments to the Cold Case Records Review Board. • Procedures for the approval of declassification and release of documents reviewed by the • Cold Case Records Review Board  Currently, the Emmett Till Act encourages the DOJ to investigate these civil rights cold cases. “Though this is a good step towards finding justice, it is not enough,” Rush said. “Outside investigators are needed to help solve these cases. Many cases exist where the perpetrators are dead and thus are no longer open to prosecution. The Cold Case Record Collections Act of 2017 allows for documents concerning such cases to be released as well. This can provide the much needed closure for families of the victims.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmanbobbyrush/photos/a.401417916536790.103175.230753786936538/1605114056167164/?type=3",NA,24,3,5,0,0,0,0,0

Rush (D-IL) lambasted Republicans who seek to demolish the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and render millions of Americans without access to affordable health care.  The legislator accused his colleagues of playing childish games with the lives of the elderly, the disabled, children and working families.  “We’ve heard rumors of drastic changes to the ACA and from what I’ve heard they will scare the hell out of anybody who desperately needs health insurance coverage,” Rep. Rush said. “The Republicans are playing peak-a-boo with seniors, the disabled, women and children—and are acting like vampires waiting for the sun to go down so they can make their move on those they perceive weaker than them. We’re here to protect the public’s interests and not wind up as cheerleaders for private profits.”  A recent analysis issued by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that 18 million Americans would lose their health insurance in just the first year following repeal, even if the law' s market reforms are kept in place. The CBO and JCT predict that 32 million fewer people would have health insurance by 2026. The Urban Institute has reached similar conclusions: if the ACA is even partially repealed, the number of uninsured Americans would increase by approximately 30 million in 2019, a 103 percent increase.  In a letter to U.S. Representative Greg Walden, chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rep. Rush joined his fellow Democrats on the Committee in saying that he was “deeply concerned by [the Chairman’s] decision to move forward with the markup in the absence of a CBO score of the bill. The decisions we make on health care will have real and drastic consequences on our constituents, their communities, and state and local economies.  “My constituents have asked Congress to focus on raising wages, creating good-paying jobs and ensuring everyone has access to capital and equal opportunity,” Rep. Rush said. “Instead, Republicans have declared all-out war on the public’s health by putting insurance companies back in charge, raising premiums, ripping guaranteed benefits away and eliminating other essential protections.” -30-","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmanbobbyrush/photos/a.401417916536790.103175.230753786936538/1611029962242240/?type=3",NA,22,10,7,2,0,0,1,2

Rush (D-IL) is expected to send a formal letter to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions asking him to rescind his memorandum to Justice Department officials which orders a review of consent decrees with local law enforcement agencies, including Chicago. The move indicates citizens protections against police brutality, misconduct, civil rights violations and fatal shootings may be in jeopardy.  On Tuesday evening, Rep. Rush offered impassioned remarks on the House floor denouncing Sessions’ effort as he evoked the names of Chicago police shooting victims Rekia Boyd and Laquan McDonald, along with others killed by law enforcement in disturbing cases around the country.  His floor statement also commemorated the 49th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who was murdered April 4, 1968 while supporting striking sanitation workers in Memphis, TN.  Rep. Rush said, “I … demand (that) Attorney General Sessions retreat from his position (and) that he stop this memorandum from circulating in the department; and that he see the light of day that many innocent American citizens are being killed because of the wayward actions of those police officers who think that they are above the law. They can't just continue to kill wantonly and think that they are above the American law and the American Constitution.”  The full text of Congressman Rush’s remarks, as noted in the Congressional Record, follows:   “…Mr. Speaker, today marks the 49th anniversary of one of the darkest days in the history of this Nation: the day that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., America's drum major for justice, was assassinated.  “Dr. King was murdered while standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968. He was there to advocate for the rights of Black sanitation workers who were fighting for their dignity: for equal pay, for equal treatment, and for racial justice in the American workplace.  “In one of the dimmest hours in our history, a voice of reason, a voice of mercy, a voice of compassion, a voice for justice, a voice of the beloved community was silenced. Yet, Mr. Speaker, his work to hold the United States to its constitutional promises that are rooted in the very fabric of our Declaration of Independence remains largely incomplete.   “As you know, Mr. Speaker, America remains a divided nation, even more so now. We are tremendously disconnected from the ideals set forth by Dr. King's monumental ``I Have a Dream'' speech. Today, we still live in two Americas: one white and privileged, another filled with people of color, the poor, the disabled, and those lost in the margins, where people of color--Black and Brown--continue to be judged by the color of their skin rather than the content of their character.  “In the year 2017, Mr. Speaker, we find the names of countless men and women who have lost their lives at the hands of too many law enforcement officials and too many police departments all across this country. Those individuals, Mr. Speaker, are now etched in the social justice history of this Nation because they were first judged by the color of their skin and not by the content of their character.  “The list is far-reaching, Mr. Speaker. I am speaking of Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray, Laquan McDonald, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Rekia Boyd, Tanisha Anderson, Yvette Smith, Shereese Francis, and, lastly, 4-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones and so many, many others. I could go on and on and on, but the names of the men, women, and children victimized by errant and wayward police departments all across this Nation would keep us here for days, even months, if we were to recite them all.  “These stalwart young citizens are joined also by the many martyrs who lost their lives in the struggle for American justice, just like Dr. King: Viola Liuzzo; Emmett Till; Jimmie Lee Jackson; Medgar Evers; Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner; the four little girls in Birmingham, Alabama; Fred Hampton; and many, many others who gave their lives during the fifties and sixties.  “In my hometown of Chicago, Mr. Speaker, the killing of Laquan McDonald rocked our city and the Nation by pulling the scab off a festering wound of police relations and the Black community. McDonald's death by 16 shots from a single police weapon fired by a police officer led to multiple investigations of previous police-involved shootings and also sparked the investigation by the United States Department of Justice under then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois.   “That investigation concluded that the Chicago Police Department officers engage ``in a pattern or practice of using force, including deadly force,'' that is unreasonable. This report also found the Chicago Police Department has failed to hold officers accountable when they use force contrary to Department policy or otherwise commit misconduct.  “To put it bluntly, Mr. Speaker, the Department of Justice found and reported that the Chicago Police Department engages in force in violation of the United States Constitution.  “Mr. Speaker, I am here today because I am just beside myself. I am angry. I am so fed up, Mr. Speaker, because I learned recently that Attorney General Jefferson Sessions has issued a memorandum ordering officials at the Justice Department to review police reform consent agreements all across the country, including the agreement that is being negotiated with the City of Chicago.   “Mr. Speaker, our Nation has fallen so very, very far. Dr. King's dream has not been realized in this Nation. The day before his assassination--this Attorney General has retreated so very, very far from the high ideals of American justice.  It is proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that police agencies--not all police officers, not all agencies, not all departments--but there are too many police departments, too many law enforcement officials, too many police officers who have wantonly killed innocent young men of color in this Nation, and it did not just begin in this year. It has been going on for decades.   “We are now at a point where some departments have been placed under a consent decree. The U.S. Attorney is now trying to retreat from that pattern.  “I am here, Mr. Speaker, to ask--to demand--that Attorney General Sessions retreat from his position, that he stop this memorandum from circulating in the department, and that he see the light of day that many innocent American citizens are being killed because of the wayward actions of those police officers who think that they are above the law. They can't just continue to kill wantonly and think that they are above the American law and the American Constitution.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmanbobbyrush/photos/a.401417916536790.103175.230753786936538/1651265674885335/?type=3",NA,30,3,14,1,0,0,0,0

Bashar al-Assad 's chemical weapons attack on his own people places him outside the circle of civilized human behavior.  Assad also continues to attack his own people with conventional weapons.  Meanwhile, Russia props up the Assad regime and enables its brutal war crimes to continue.  The President’s action and any response demands that we immediately do our duty.  Congress must live up to its Constitutional responsibility to debate an Authorization of the Use of Military Force against a sovereign nation.  As heartbreaking as Assad’s chemical weapons attacks on his own people was, the crisis in Syria will not be resolved by one night of airstrikes. The killing will not stop without a comprehensive political solution to end the violence. The American people are owed a comprehensive strategy with clear objectives to keep our brave men and women in uniform safe and avoid collateral damage to innocent civilians in Syria.   I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible on this matter of grave concern to our national security.  best regards,  NANCY PELOSI Democratic Leader","status",NA,NA,22,5,9,2,0,0,0,0

Rush","2017-04-19","2017-04-19 14:35:48","E&C Dems Request GAO Review Dam Safety Standards Following Oroville Dam Failure -“The Oroville Dam failure did not come without warning”   Washington, D.C. – Energy and Commerce Committee Democrats sent a letter to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) today to request a review of federal safety standards in evaluating dams during the hydroelectric re-licensing process conducted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).  The letter comes on the heels of the recent failure at the Oroville Dam in California, which raised questions about the deficiencies in FERC’s safety review process and concerns over the potential for loss of life and severe property damage.    The request was made by all six California Democrats on the committee: Anna Eshoo (D-CA), Doris Matsui (D-CA), Jerry McNerney (D-CA), Tony Cárdenas (D-CA), Raul Ruiz (D-CA), and Scott Peters (D-CA), as well as full committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ), Energy Subcommittee Ranking Member Bobby Rush (D-IL) and Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Ranking Member Diana DeGette (D-CO).   “The Oroville Dam failure did not come without warning,” the nine E&C Committee Democrats wrote in their letter to GAO.   The members pointed to the fact that in 2005 the Sierra Club, the Friends of the River and the South Yuba Citizens League filed formal motions with FERC arguing that the agency should require the facility’s licensees to install a concrete-lined emergency spillway as part of the relicensing of the dam.   FERC denied this motion, asserting that the emergency spillway was adequate to handle up to 350,000 cubic feet of water per second (cfs).  A July 2006 memo from John Onderdonk, then a senior civil engineer for FERC, stated that the emergency spillway ‘would perform as designed’ and that sediment resulting from erosion would be insignificant.   “As climate change alters weather patterns, the risk of similar failures rises significantly,” the members continued in their letter to GAO.  “The twin-pronged threat of aging dams and climate change presents a real crisis for dam safety in the United States.  The Oroville incident suggests that FERC’s process for reviewing and assessing dam safety facilities during the relicensing process may have serious deficiencies.”    To help better understand FERC’s Dam Safety Inspections program, E&C Democrats asked GAO to conduct a review of the program including questions on:  • What policies and procedures govern FERC’s safety assessment of dams and related dam facilities during the relicensing process?  What compliance, monitoring, and assurance provisions ensure safe and complete assessments are conducted? • What models, computer simulations and other analytical tools are used by FERC to evaluate anticipated dam performance, establish ranges of safe operation for a dam and its associated facilities, and assess potential hazards in case of dam failure?   • To what extent does FERC take into account changing weather patterns, changes in hydrologic patterns, or altered morphology of the river, streams, and reservoir associated with the dam and hydropower facility due to erosion, sedimentation, weatherization, seismic activity, or other natural phenomenon during the re-licensing process? • Where FERC staff engineers find evidence of a safety failure, what consequences does the dam owner face, if any?   • How does FERC evaluate alternative assessments of dam and facility performance that may be submitted by different interested parties during re-licensing? • What are the respective roles and responsibilities of the licensee, the state, and FERC in the evaluation of the structural integrity and anticipated performance of a dam and its related facilities during the licensing and re-licensing process?    Earlier this year the spillways of the Oroville Dam began to fail, leading to the evacuation of 188,000 people living near the dam.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmanbobbyrush/photos/a.401417916536790.103175.230753786936538/1672591439419425/?type=3",NA,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
