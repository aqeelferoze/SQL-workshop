He spoke about how to pray. He spoke about his own journey in prayer. For twenty minutes he spoke—with humor, with passion, with sincerity—and lifted every single person in that room up. Republicans and Democrats, Muslims and Jews, Americans and foreign visitors, it doesn’t matter—for twenty brief yet enduring minutes we were all united in awe of his message.

I had concerns with the bill including the fact that it did not address the true, underlying drivers of cost in our healthcare system.   Our current healthcare system is overly costly, cumbersome, and not producing the outcomes Wisconsinites need at a price Wisconsinites can afford; and the ACA has exacerbated this problem for many. Any new healthcare law would impact millions of our fellow citizens and we need to do the job right.

As we move forward, we must be honest about our objectives in Afghanistan and the resources required to achieve victory in the longest war in our history.  As we examine the new strategy in greater detail, I look forward to Congress exercising its constitutionally-mandated oversight responsibilities and helping to define the ends, ways, and means of our strategy in South Asia.  Regardless, we will not be able to meet these objectives while failing to end the devastating impact of defense cuts. In order to tackle the substantial challenges we face in Afghanistan and across the globe, we need to invest in rebuilding our military power and giving our service members the tools they need to be successful.","status",NA,NA,64,35,2,2,3,0,0,6

Mike Gallagher","2017-11-11","2017-11-11 17:57:49","This morning I delivered the following speech to the Fox Valley Veterans Council in honor of #VeteransDay, and the 100th anniversary of America's entry into WWI:  ""Today we gather to pay tribute to our nation’s veterans, both the living and the dead, who have fought our wars and won our peace.  They comprise less than 9% of our population, and less than 1% of our nation since 9/11. Yet you need only look around you, at all the veterans here today—Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, Coasties—to be reminded of how closely our veterans are connected to our community.   2017 marks a special anniversary in the history of our nation. One hundred years ago, America entered the Great War. While we sadly no longer have any World War I veterans with us, we honor their sacrifices in particular. More than four million Americans served in the First World War. 116, 516 were killed and 200,000 wounded, a casualty rate far greater than in World War II.   Wisconsin was in many ways a reluctant participant in the Great War. We had a large German American population and the antiwar Socialists and Progressive Republicans were ascendant. Indeed, our state’s most prominent politician, Senator Bob La Follette, was doggedly committed to a policy of strict neutrality.    As the war raged in Europe and spread into the Middle East, President Woodrow Wilson spoke of making the world safe for democracy, a noble cause for which, Wilson argued, “America is privileged to spend her blood.” This war, we were told, would end all wars.   Our own fighting Bob LaFollette burst into tears on the Senate floor while arguing against America’s entry into the war [1].  La Follette and his colleagues lost the argument but to their credit, many politicians who vehemently opposed the war labored to ensure that once we were in, we’d fight to win. As Wisconsin’s 7th District Republican Congressman John Esch, who voted against the war, said, “now that we are at war it is the duty of every loyal citizen to stand by his government and its flag without faltering or delay.”   Wisconsin stepped up and did its part. One week after the declaration of war, Wisconsin became the first state to form a council of defense, which quickly established chapters in every county. Families saved food and coal to feed and fuel the Army and our allies. The Red Cross of Brown County sold Liberty bonds with the slogan “your share is fair.” In September 1917, the Wisconsin legislature mandated that every student in junior high and high school learn and sing patriotic songs. Women rushed to factories and fields, filling the labor force shortage caused by men deploying to combat [2].   Over 118,000 young Wisconsinites went to war as 72 cities around the state contributed soldiers to what would become the 32nd Division [3].  They sailed for France in January 1918, and entered combat in May. For the next five and a half months, they were in combat almost continuously until the armistice on November 11, 1918.   The 32nd, some 24,000 men strong, suffered 15,000 casualties, including 2,600 combat deaths (the third highest casualty rate for an American unit). The division earned its nickname, the “Red Arrow” division, on the battlefields of Europe by piercing every enemy line it encountered.   As Wisconsinites, we should look back on this history with pride. But we should also look for lessons. To me two stand out; one an enduring lie and one an enduring truth.  The enduring lie is the idea that we can end all war. Even in a world made safe (or safer) for democracy—a world where freedom was on the march rather than in retreat from rising forces of authoritarianism—we would still face threats from rogue states, tyrants, and terrorists. And to the extent this lie serves—as it has at various points in our history—as an excuse for inaction, it is dangerous. Because as Machiavelli pointed out: “War cannot be avoided; it can only be postponed to the other's advantage.” Here in the Midwest we might simply say: problems don’t age well. This is as true in our personal lives as it is on the world stage.   Which leads to the enduring truth. In a world that will always be a bit Machiavellian—that is to say dangerous and filled with bad actors who want to end our American experiment—the best chance we have of avoiding war is to prepare for it. Time and again, our history has shown that when we let down our guard, when we neglect our defense, when we try to retreat from the great problems of international politics, those problems get worse until they cannot be ignored. Better for us to be vigilant, shaping events to our advantage. Better for us to be forward-engaged, deterring conflict before it spirals into war. Better for us to be strong, sending a clear signal that there is no better friend, no worse enemy than the United States of America.     And what today’s events should remind us is that the source of America’s strength doesn’t come from the sheer size of its military, or the weapons we carry downrange, but from the character and the spirit of the men and women who fight our country’s wars.   This, in turn is a reflection of the character and spirit of the communities that produce such people. For as the rapid mobilization of the Red Arrow division shows—taking kids from Appleton, Oconto, and Sturgeon Bay and molding them into a feared fighting force—demonstrates, the strength of our military and our veterans comes in large part from the communities from which they emerge.   And so today as we honor our veterans’ sacrifices, I’d ask you also to keep in mind the young servicemen and women from Northeast Wisconsin who are right now deployed in defense of this community and this country. Right now, at this very moment, in remote bases in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, they are risking everything to keep us safe. They are holding the line. They are holding the line abroad in order to give us a chance here at home to solve our problems peacefully as a community. They are holding the line in order to give us a chance to figure out how to come together again out of many communities into one nation.   We can’t let them down. That’s how we honor our veterans, each day, in the small choices we make as individuals and as a community. That’s how we renew our Republic.""   Endnotes:   [1] As historian Walter McDougall writes of La Follette's response “If the world was being made safe for democracy, why didn’t the British practice democracy in Ireland, India, or Egypt? If Wilson was distinguishing between the common people and their oppressive rules, how come more Germans supported the Kaiser than American voters supported Wilson?” On April 6, 1917, the Senate voted 82-6 in favor of War and the House 373-50 the next day. Nine of Wisconsin's eleven Congressmen, plus Senator La Follette, voted against the declaration of war.   [2] Women went from 3 percent of the industrial workforce in 1914 to 20 percent by the end of the war. As historian Richard Pifer wrote about Wisconsin during World War I: “charitable war work, food and fuel conservation, bond and fundraising drives, and farm and factory production all succeeded because average people voluntarily did what they were asked to do. The true mark of patriotism on the home front was not the great heroic act; it was the small sacrifices made every day to win the war.”   [3] Including Company F out of Sturgeon Bay, commanded by Captain Edward S. Reynolds, the son of the manager of Door County Fruit Growers Canning Co. Captain Reynolds along with two other members of Company F would be awarded the Croix de Guerre by the French government for bravery on the battlefield.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepMikeGallagher/photos/a.320736458373821.1073741829.223635794750555/355553761558757/?type=3",NA,39,6,4,0,0,0,0,0

This status quo—an unfair, broken system written by special interests for special interests—is unacceptable.  Our bill begins to move the ball down the field in a better direction, especially for those in our community who are struggling to survive pay-check to pay-check. With this tax reform the average working family in Northeast Wisconsin will be able to keep $2,000 more of their hard-earned pay each year—and they won’t have to spend that money to hire someone else to do their taxes. Lower rates and a simplified code will allow smaller employers in the 8th District to buy new equipment and invest in workers’ wages so that they can be competitive in the global marketplace. Our reforms will also incentivize large employers to return to the U.S. from overseas—bringing with them good paying, middle-class jobs—and reinvest in our local communities.  There is still plenty of work to be done, and no bill is perfect, but ultimately this is about allowing families in Northeast Wisconsin to make choices on how they spend their money, rather than laundering their money through special interests in Washington, D.C.  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to do their part so that the hardworking taxpayers in the 8th District can get the relief they need and deserve.

Our enemy calculated that a swift blow and public pressure would cause us to quickly sue for peace. Instead, aggression was met by the courage and steadfast determination of the American people. We won, but at great cost, including those who perished 76 years ago today. The lesson of 1941 is that we can never allow our adversaries to believe the potential gains from war are worth the inevitable cost. The world looks to the U.S. to defend the peace for which so many fought and died. Let's honor their sacrifice through our actions.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepMikeGallagher/videos/364796723967794/",NA,40,13,5,1,0,0,1,0

At the center of this historic effort is the belief that families—not lobbyists and special interests in Washington D.C.—should make decisions on how they spend their money. By lowering rates across the board, Wisconsinites will keep more of their income, and Wisconsin’s small businesses will have a fair shot at growing their companies so they can compete in the global economy.     This bill is a huge step forward, but we still have additional work to do, particularly when it comes to getting folks back into the workforce. For as long as I represent Northeast Wisconsin, I will continue to fight for policies that empower individuals and families, help our manufacturers compete globally, and allow our economy to grow.","link","https://gallagher.house.gov/media/press-releases/gallagher-s-statement-passage-historic-tax-reform","gallagher.house.gov",99,229,12,23,7,0,6,132
