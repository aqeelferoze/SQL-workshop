H.R. 7 permanently bans the use of federal funds to pay for elective abortions and healthcare plans with elective abortion coverage. H.R. 7 mandates transparency from health care providers to their patients about the existence of elective abortion coverage within their plans.   H.R. 7 gives Americans the assurance that their federal tax dollars are not being used to subsidize elective abortions. Now that we have a pro-life President and majorities in the House and Senate, I hope that we can begin to protect every life and cut off taxpayer funding for abortion providers.

For this reason, Congress should compel Susan Rice to appear before Congress so that she may clarify her alleged role in unmasking President Trump’s name in U.S. intelligence reports and tell us what she did with that specific information. My constituents and I have an increasing number of questions about this situation as new developments unfold, which heightens the urgency to receive direct answers from Ms. Rice.   If it turns out that Ms. Rice – or anyone in our government – inappropriately used this information about President Trump to discredit his leadership and legitimacy, they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. We live in a country of due process, where Americans need to trust that their law-abiding actions and conversations are not subject to government collection or interference. For this reason, Congress must revisit the authority within the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows our government to collect data it can potentially use on Americans for nefarious or political reasons. The United States of America does not tolerate a society where any level or branch of government is above the law, and I will join my colleagues in demanding truthful answers from Ms. Rice.","link","http://www.nationalreview.com/article/446415/susan-rice-unmasking-trump-campaign-members-obama-administration-fbi-cia-nsa","nationalreview.com",25,57,5,0,4,1,0,11

The Congressional Gold Medal is awarded by the United States Congress and is the highest civilian award in the United States, on par with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. However, the Congressional Gold Medal is more rare, as fewer of them have been awarded.  Bob Joyner joined CAP as a cadet in 1942 while still attending high school. When asked why he joined the CAP, he said: “It was the thing to do back in those days and because I loved airplanes so much. It was my way to contribute to the national war effort.” Later, he served honorably in the United States Air Force.  His response tells us a lot about him and those of his generation.

It takes courage, foresight, wisdom, capital, and years of perseverance. Lots of small businesses don’t work out, but that doesn’t make the efforts any less valuable. Every lesson learned and applied helps the American economy prosper.   President Donald J. Trump and this Congress are committed to helping small businesses succeed. So far, we have cut regulations that will save billions of dollars in compliance fees, and will be considering a tax reform package to lower the tax rate for businesses. Our work is making it easier for small businesses to operate, which, in turn, opens the door for significant job creation.

Trump did not succumb to pressures from other G7 nations to endorse the Paris Climate Agreement. In 2016, then-candidate Trump campaigned to prioritize American interests and vowed to cancel the United States’ involvement in the international accord, stating that the “agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use right here in America.” He was exactly right, and I trust he will follow through with his promise.  The Paris Climate Agreement was conceived without consent from the U.S. Senate and is another example of President Obama’s prolific assault on American energy production. The agreement increases onerous, job-killing regulations and commits billions of American taxpayer dollars to the Green Climate Fund. It also obligates the United States to adhere to specific targets to reduce emissions, but lacks true accountability for other nations to uphold their parts of the agreement.  It is time for the United States of America to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. Doing so would roll back many of the previous administration’s burdensome regulations that have stifled job creation and economic productivity and restore American sovereignty. I hope President Donald J. Trump continues this trend with his impending decision on the accord.  For more excellent commentary on the Paris Climate Agreement, read this op-ed.","link","https://www.commentarymagazine.com/politics-ideas/goodbye-paris-accord-climate/","commentarymagazine.com",90,115,19,16,0,0,3,97

Gala dedicated her Personal Development to the study and practice of intermediated and advanced Turkish. She is now able to have more elaborate conversations with Native Turkish friends. For her Physical Fitness, Gala wanted to obtain the orange belt in Taekwondo. She practiced at least 3 hours a week and she was able to go from the white belt to the orange belt.

Four of these monuments are in our home state of Arizona.   Most people do not realize that west of the Mississippi, there is very little private property ownership; most of the land is instead owned by the federal and state government. The Obama Administration compounded this problem by expanding the scope of the 1906 Antiquities Act, which led to massive land grabs and wrested millions of dollars in economic activity from western states. The 1906 Antiquities Act has also become the catalyst for radical environmentalist groups seeking to prevent Americans from having access to the nation’s natural resources.

Article I of the United States Constitution grants Congress exclusive power to write federal laws. This structure allows the American people to hold their elected representatives accountable for the policy decisions they make. Over the years, however, Congress has increasingly ceded power to the executive branch by allowing agencies run by unelected bureaucrats to implement regulations that have the force and effect of law.   We made an excellent start to rolling back the regulatory state in the 115th Congress, but it absolutely should not end our efforts. My main priority while in Congress is to restore the constitutional parameters of the federal government, including ending overregulation. With that in mind, each Friday, I will highlight a freedom-killing regulation that is currently in effect.

Trump's announcement regarding contraceptive/abortifacient services is a great decision for religious freedom, the U.S. Constitution, and the American people. The Obama administration subjected Americans to the horrors of Obamacare, and intentionally disregarded our fundamental right to religious freedom – most notably with the contraceptive mandate. No American should be forced to participate in an activity or purchase a commodity that violates his or her conscience, nor should any man, woman, or child feel threatened in the exercise of religious expression or commitment by their government.  Thankfully, the U.S. Supreme Court, in its 2014 decision, already affirmed that the Obama administration had abused its Constitutional authority. Now the Trump administration has followed through with its promise and ensured that there are more safeguards for religious freedom in this country. I am grateful for President Donald J. Trump and his administration for these protections, and I will work in Congress to ensure that the religious freedom is cherished, defended, and enshrined to the full extent of our legislative abilities.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepAndyBiggs/photos/a.775068926006914.1073741827.774716719375468/928669317313540/?type=3",NA,345,214,40,51,3,2,2,156

Joining me on the floor were Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, Congressman Matt Gaetz, Congressman Trent Franks, Louie Gohmert, Rep. Scott Perry, Congressman Ted Yoho, and Congressman Jody Hice.  As I recall the events of the past two years, it becomes clearer than ever that Robert Mueller should resign. If he does not resign, then he should be fired. We believe he has conflicts of interest that do not allow him to proceed with his investigation in an unbiased, independent manner. Further, he has broadened the scope of his investigation far beyond his charge to examine Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election. In the process, he is helping to destroy the integrity, perception, and credibility of the American justice system.  This is the scandal of our time. It affects our national security and the views of the American people for justice and on elections. I renew my call for Robert Mueller’s resignation; short of that, his termination of employment.","link","https://biggs.house.gov/media/press-releases/house-republican-members-demand-renewed-investigations-conflicts-interest-those","biggs.house.gov",219,152,41,28,8,3,0,59

It provides relief from burdensome taxes for most Americans – individuals, families, and businesses. I am optimistic that when we complete the legislative process, we will see tax cuts for all Americans.  We understand that Americans know best how to spend their hard-earned money. We know that when Americans receive more money in their paychecks, they will use that extra income to stimulate the economy. We recognize the need to reduce tax rates for business owners to encourage economic activity and job growth. H.R. 1 will provide this relief to families and businesses, while simplifying a tax code that has grown insatiably for over thirty years.  By passing H.R. 1, we send a message to Arizonans and to the world that the United States is most successful when individuals and families take charge of their own economic destinies. We still have to work to shape this legislation, but I am hopeful in the resolve of my colleagues to ensure its final passage. I look forward to reducing the tax burden for every taxpayer. The result will be economic prosperity for us, our children, and our grandchildren.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepAndyBiggs/photos/a.775068926006914.1073741827.774716719375468/948735961973542/?type=3",NA,97,86,6,9,1,0,2,44

Kate's killer had been previously deported five times and had been released on the streets while he awaited a sixth deportation.  Earlier this summer, the House of Representatives passed ""Kate's Law"" and ""Grant's Law,"" which would increase the penalties for illegal aliens in our country and keep criminally violent illegal aliens off of the streets as they await deportation. This legislation - and other immigration enforcement bills - sit idly in the Senate. Kate's death was tragic, but the inaction by the Senate to help prevent other crimes from illegal aliens is inexcusable.

Yet, as per usual, another bill - Fix NICS - was attached to the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. This bill is problematic. It shouldn't have been attached to this legislation for a number of reasons.  I tried to split the two bills, but the Rules Committee would not consider my amendment. I voted against the rule for the bill today because I disagreed with the combination of the two bills. I then voted for the bill itself because Concealed Carry Reciprocity was too important to be defeated on the floor.  It's a shame that we couldn't enjoy a complete 2nd Amendment victory today.

Due to this interference, all internet consumers would see price increases, and the success of smaller Internet Service Providers (ISPs) would be stifled. Now, internet freedom has been restored.

In 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) developed rules to expand the scope of the HMDA, which was enacted in the 1970s to prevent discriminatory lending practices. It is not clear that adding more reporting requirements will have any measurable effect on preventing further instances of discriminatory lending. Instead, this requirement would double the paperwork that lenders fill out each time they offer a loan. This places an enormous, new regulatory burden on small and mid-size lenders.  “I believe that Congress should determine appropriate banking regulations – not unelected bureaucrats at the CFPB. I trust that CFPB Acting Director Mick Mulvaney is committed to this principle, and I know he is already working to restore Article I authority to the legislative branch. However, it is incumbent on Congress to codify these necessary regulatory rollbacks into law. Earlier this year, the House passed the “Financial CHOICE Act” (H.R. 10), which includes a provision to delay implementation of this regulation until January 1, 2019. While this is a positive first step, I don’t believe this delay goes far enough. My bill will completely eliminate the HDMA rule to help, not hinder, lenders lend.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepAndyBiggs/photos/a.788557517991388.1073741829.774716719375468/963468587166946/?type=3",NA,39,35,2,3,1,1,2,11

Here they are for your perusal:   Amendment I Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.  Amendment II A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.  Amendment III No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.  Amendment IV The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.  Amendment V No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.  Amendment VI In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.  Amendment VII In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.  Amendment VIII Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.

Once again, Congress is too afraid to make the tough decisions to balance our budget.   The House sent its appropriations bills to the Senate exactly fourteen weeks ago today.

We are able to serve the district because of the sacrifices they (and their families) made to this country.   As we approach a new year, I am more committed than ever to assisting our heroes with their veterans services and working with my colleagues to reform the Veterans Administration.   We've opened up satellite office hours at the Southeast Veterans Affairs Health Care Clinic to give veterans another opportunity to talk to our staff members about their issues. I look forward to this continuing in the new year.  There is still much work to do to instill confidence in this system, and we must keep our promises. We cannot fail our veterans. We will not fail them.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepAndyBiggs/photos/a.775068926006914.1073741827.774716719375468/779149895598817/?type=3",NA,89,14,0,6,0,0,0,3
