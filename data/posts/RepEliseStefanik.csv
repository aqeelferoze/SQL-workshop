This resolution formally adopts the legislative rules for the next session of Congress. Critically, this resolution removed the amendment relating to the Office of Congressional Ethics and passed by a vote of 234-193.  Additionally, with my support, the House passed H.R. 27 – the Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act, and H.R. 28 – the Biological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety Act with strong bipartisan support.  Today I voted in support of H.R. 21 – the Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2017. This important legislation provides accountability and transparency to the American people. “Midnight Rules” are regulations, often high-cost or politically-driven, that are rushed into place in the last days and months of a presidential administration. This legislation provides Congress with the tools and flexibility to disapprove of poorly conceived rules that were put in place in the lame duck session of the Obama Administration, and paves the way for comprehensive regulatory reform. This legislation passed by a vote of 238-184.  Additionally, with my support, the House today passed six pieces of legislation with strong bipartisan support, including H.J.Res. 3 – a resolution approving the location of a memorial to commemorate and honor the members of the Armed Forces who served on active duty in support of Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert Shield; H.R. 71 – the Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act; H.R. 73 – the Presidential Library Donation Reform Act; H.R. 70 – the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2017; H.R. 72 – the GAO Access and Oversight Act; and H.R. 69 – the Thoroughly Investigating Retaliation Against Whistleblowers Act.

When I visit businesses across the North Country, one of the top concerns I hear about is the negative effects burdensome regulations from Washington have on their ability to grow and create jobs. The REINS Act pushes back against overregulation by federal bureaucrats and gives power back to the people by requiring that Congress vote on any major rule or regulation coming from the executive branch. This is a commonsense step for transparent and accountable government that will help grow our economy and create jobs for North Country families. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 237-187.  Additionally, today I voted in support of H. Res. 11, a bipartisan resolution objecting to United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 as an obstacle to Israeli-Palestinian peace. Recently, in its’ waning days, the Obama Administration failed to uphold longstanding U.S. policy to oppose and veto any one-sided and anti-Israel resolutions at the UN Security Council. The U.S. has no greater ally in the region than Israel, and this UN resolution is biased against Israel, does not call upon the Palestinian Authority to fulfill their obligations to negotiations, and contributes to the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement against Israel. This resolution calls for UN Security Council Resolution 2334 to be repealed or fundamentally altered so that it is no longer anti-Israel and it allows final status issues for a two-state solution to be resolved through direct bilateral negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. This resolution passed by a bipartisan vote of 342-80.","status",NA,NA,56,47,6,1,0,0,0,12

In my first term alone, I participated in over 500 district events in addition to hosting hundreds of constituent meetings in my Washington office while in legislative session. We've also held nine telephone town halls where I am able to listen to and speak with tens of thousands of constituents to hear their concerns.   Having these respectful dialogues is important to me, and I believe they are the most effective way for me to take your voice and priorities to Congress.  And as I've done since I first became your Representative, over the coming months I will continue inviting groups of constituents and taking meetings in our Glens Falls, Plattsburgh, Watertown, and Washington, DC offices to listen and hear your concerns.  So far hundreds of groups have effectively advocated for their issues in this constructive format. And this week, my office will continue to be proactive in reaching out to numerous groups who have contacted us. Hearing their concerns and listening to their ideas is very important to me, even if we disagree.  I believe in free speech and our ability to gather together and make our voices heard; however, it’s unfortunate and counterproductive that a small number of activists believe the best way to address the very serious issues facing our country is to hijack and ambush community events for the sole purpose of political theater.  Many members of various protest groups have repeatedly harassed my hardworking staff and have personally targeted specific staff members. This type of intentionally disruptive behavior is unacceptable and unhelpful to civil public discourse. If it gets out of hand, we will continue to contact local law enforcement and U.S. Capitol Police.   These disruptions have challenged my staff’s ability to continue serving you - our constituents - on important casework regarding federal agencies. Because of these disruptions and calls from individuals outside of our district, we are planning to invest in additional resources to address the thousands of calls we receive each week - many of which are hourly callers. It is imperative that my staff is able to continue to focus on federal casework on behalf of the constituents of New York’s 21st District, and that my constituents understand that despite the efforts from these organized  disruptors, we will always continue our work to best serve you.  As has been our office policy from the beginning, if you'd like to request a meeting in my office, and are a constituent of the 21st Congressional District, please do so here:   https://stefanik.house.gov/contact/request-appearance.

I plan on posting weekly updates of the number of calls and letters my office has responded to on your behalf and for your transparency.

It also establishes transparency of the review process and requires OIRA to make available all information provided by the agency, the result of the review, and changes agencies made to a regulation while under review period.

This legislation would allow small businesses to join together through association health plans (AHPs) to provide their employees greater access to affordable healthcare—giving them the same advantages larger businesses have when purchasing healthcare for their employees. This will help expand access as well as lower costs for families and businesses – a win-win for the North Country. I was proud to vote in favor of this legislation which passed the House by a vote of 236-175.   Additionally, I voted in support of H.R. 372 - the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017. This bipartisan legislation ensures that health insurance companies are subject to the same anti-trust and unfair business practice laws that all businesses must comply with. This bill will subject insurers to laws that prohibit practices such as price fixing, bid rigging and others that harm consumers. This bill passed the House by a vote of 416-7.   Additionally, with my support, the House passed H.R. 1238 – the Securing our Agriculture and Food Act, by a bipartisan vote of 406-6.  This bill would create a program within the Department of Homeland Security to improve our food, agriculture and veterinary defenses from acts of terrorism.","status",NA,NA,72,94,7,4,1,2,1,0

As the Chair of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, this was an important opportunity for our delegation to conduct oversight of the policy, strategy, and resource issues associated with Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq/Syria and Operation Resolute Support in Afghanistan.   The Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee has an important oversight role for counter-terrorism programs and initiatives and counter proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Additionally, this subcommittee oversees U.S. Special Operations Forces, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, information technology and programs, force protection policy and oversight, and related intelligence support. It makes sure that our nation is protected against terrorist attacks and unconventional threats.  Among our briefings and meetings, our delegation met with the Commander of all U.S. Special Operations Forces in Iraq and Syria for full updates on current and future operations to counter ISIS, including partnering engagements and operations with the units from the Iraqi Army and the Syrian Democratic Forces.  This trip was also a special opportunity to visit with our brave men and women in uniform deployed in this region. I had the opportunity to visit many constituents from our district, including servicemen and women from Greenwich, Plattsburgh, Star Lake, Schuylerville, Turin, Saranac Lake, Saratoga, Wilton, Cambridge, South Glens Falls, Lake George and Massena.

That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor H.R. 2683, the Protecting Veterans Credit Act. Congress previously created the Veterans Choice Program to address the unacceptable delays veterans faced when attempting to access care at the Veterans Administration. The Protecting Veterans Credit Act will prohibit medical debt received through the Veterans Choice Program from being reported to credit agencies and further streamlines payment processing through the Veterans Choice Program. It is critical that we continue to do all we can for our veterans, and this bill will help our veterans purchase homes, apply for loans, and better transition to civilian life.","link","https://stefanik.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/stefanik-cosponsors-protecting-veterans-credit-act","stefanik.house.gov",61,22,5,2,0,1,0,1

As we know in the North Country, protecting our environment goes hand in hand with strengthening our economy. We understand climate change is a serious threat that must be addressed by our entire global community, and the United States should continue to lead.  United States innovation and business leadership have been key drivers to lowering our carbon emissions over the last 20 years, and we should continue to have an influential seat at the table as the rest of the world addresses these issues. Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement is misguided, and harms the ongoing effort to fight climate change while also isolating us from our allies.

This bill passed on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis.","status",NA,NA,25,14,3,0,0,0,0,4

Military spouses serve too, and this piece of legislation eliminates the daunting task of documenting multiple tax jurisdictions, which at times causes some spouses to forego the complication of working all together.

In the days following 9/11, Americans came together in a way that proved to our enemies that the American spirit is insurmountable.   America came back from these attacks stronger than ever. Today and every day we keep the memories of the victims in our hearts, and recommit ourselves to the values of freedom and unity.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepEliseStefanik/photos/a.789386871127503.1073741828.788498101216380/1491190327613817/?type=3",NA,77,8,5,5,0,0,8,1

I believe that any tax reform plan should make the code flatter, fairer and simpler for families and businesses in our district, should allow middle class families to keep more of their paychecks, and should lower taxes on our small businesses so that they can compete around the globe.  I applaud President Trump and my colleagues in Congress for making this a top priority and for unveiling this framework today, and I look forward to representing the North Country during the tax reform process.

This bill prohibits Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments to individuals with outstanding felony warrants or parole violations. Under current law, a wanted felon is still eligible to receive government issued checks despite evading prosecution. North Country taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to fund fugitives evading justice, and this legislation is estimated to save the government more than $2.1 billion. This bill passed by a vote of 244-171.  Additionally, I voted in favor of H.R. 3823 - the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017. This legislation provides temporary tax relief to the victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria by allowing victims to deduct more of the cost of property damage and to grant easier access to retirement savings. It also encourages charitable giving by suspending the limitation on the deduction for charitable contributions. This legislation also reauthorizes the Federal Aviation Administration for six months. This bill passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 264-155.  Finally, with my support, the House passed S. 1866 - the Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria Education Relief Act of 2017, to help provide relief to students affected by the recent devastation in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico.

This is verifiable by reading a journal that my mother kept when I was a child and to the question of what do you want to do when you grow up, the answer was “join the Air Force” for most of those years.
