It is my hope that President Donald Trump will transform his behavior of insult and division, surround himself with knowledgeable thought leaders, and move our country in a positive direction.  He should resist any effort to eliminate health care for 30 million Americans and fundamentally change the Medicare and Medicaid programs that provide health care to our citizens.

Jeff Sessions has once again shown he is not fit to serve as our nation’s top law enforcement officer.  It is essential that there be trust between the U.S. Attorney General and the American people.  By testifying under oath that he did not have communications with the Russians during his Senate confirmation hearing, Jeff Sessions has breached this trust and raises questions of apparent perjury that must be investigated.  In light of this report and last month’s call for Michael Flynn’s resignation after he concealed conversations with the Russians, there is no question that we need an independent, bipartisan, transparent commission to investigate this Administration’s connections and communications with Russia.  At minimum, the Attorney General must recuse himself from any oversight of an investigation of senior Trump officials’ ties to the Russian government.","status",NA,NA,132,33,23,7,0,0,0,7

They have hidden the bill in a room in the United States Capitol and are only allowing certain Republican members of Congress access to it.  This isn’t democracy – it’s a direct reversal of the promise Republicans made to the American people to run an open and transparent government.    I am deeply concerned that Republicans are allowing this bill that is being kept secret from Democratic members of Congress and the American people to advance through the legislative process without any congressional hearings or public input.  This Republican stonewalling is nothing more than a sneak attack to take away health care from millions of Americans.  The American people deserve to know the details of any health care plan being proposed and should  be afforded the the opportunity to make their views known to their elected representatives.    Yesterday I was joined by my Democratic colleagues on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, in sending a letter to Chairman Greg Walden (R-OR) to demand that the text of the ACA repeal bill be posted for the public to view for at least 30 days before a markup is held.  It’s sad and disappointing, but unfortunately not at all surprising, that Republican members of Congress are hiding such a consequential bill from their colleagues and the American people.  Our country deserves better than this manufactured sideshow.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmangkbutterfield/photos/a.367090353327035.79285.274687979233940/1291462434223151/?type=3",NA,58,23,55,5,0,5,3,36

And once again, President Trump- though, light on details- clearly demonstrates regressive priorities that will have an extreme impact on working families.  If Congress adopts President Trump’s proposed budget, agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institutes of Health, and the State Department face large cuts. Smaller agencies such as the National Endowment for the Arts and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting stand to be eliminated under President Trump’s plan. The President’s proposal also calls for the elimination of key economic development agencies including the Minority Business Development Agency and the Economic Development Administration.  This budget fails to address our economic problems by slashing funding that supports our long-standing commitment to increase economic opportunities through investments in education, infrastructure, affordable housing, and job training. Many of these programs sustain older Americans and so many in eastern North Carolina.  I am outraged by the President’s call to drastically cut funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This will be devastating to programs that support public housing in low-income communities and, quite frankly, keep a roof over people’s heads. Under the President’s proposal, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) will be cut entirely, significantly impacting small, rural communities like the ones in my congressional district. More than 88,000 households in North Carolina benefit from LIHEAP, and the very threat of this program’s elimination could push these families beyond the tipping point. The CDBG program has been a successful means of helping communities secure federal funding for local neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development activities.  I cannot and will not support measures that take a wrecking ball to programs that have long supported low and moderate-income Americans.  President Trump calls his proposal the ‘America First’ budget, but this plan puts many Americans last.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmangkbutterfield/photos/a.367090353327035.79285.274687979233940/1305936332775761/?type=3",NA,29,11,18,0,0,1,4,15

The Republican health care plan could hurt you- even if you get insurance through your employer.  Under the Affordable Care Act, health care plans could not impose annual or lifetime limits on reimbursements for expenses incurred from 10 essential benefits such as emergency services, rehabilitative services, inpatient care, outpatient care, maternity and newborn care, mental health and addiction treatment, lab tests, preventive care, prescriptions, and pediatric services, including oral and vision care.   The GOP plan would eliminate this mandate, allowing states to waive requirements for insurance companies. This could force millions of people with pre-existing conditions to face higher out-of-pocket costs and struggle to find affordable plans that cover the services and treatments they need.","link","http://time.com/money/4820506/the-senate-health-care-bill-could-hurt-you-even-if-you-get-insurance-through-work-report-says/","time.com",61,27,78,1,1,4,9,60

Last year under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid offered health coverage to over 1 million rural North Carolinians and has become a critical financial lifeline for rural hospitals. Sadly, the Republican bill would significantly cut the Medicaid program as we know it. Additionally, families in rural areas have greatly benefitted from the ACA’s premium tax credits and cost-sharing protections.  These benefits stand to be eliminated under the GOP healthcare bill, leaving many rural Americans unable to afford their high insurance premiums. The Republican plan would also eliminate protections that enable people with pre-existing conditions to get the same coverage and services as healthy people, forcing many rural and older Americans to pay much higher out-of-pocket costs.   With the Senate expected to vote on this bill next week, we must continue to fight this harmful legislation every step of the way.","link","https://shar.es/1BsISw","shar.es",32,21,17,0,2,1,8,21

This is purely a political move by the president, who, in the past, promised to treat these young people with compassion. Now, he is threatening the futures of nearly 800,000 young people who risk being subjected to deportation. Since its creation, DACA has allowed young people to receive temporary and renewable work permits, allowing them to serve as nurses, educators, engineers, and leaders in our communities. They contribute to our communities and provide a positive economic impact in our state. The president should think twice before betraying these young people who have passed background checks and were granted permission to live and work legally in America.

Julius Chambers was a civil rights icon in North Carolina and across the country. I first heard the name “Julius Chambers” in 1965, on my first day of history class at North Carolina Central University. The professor looked at me and said, “Mr. Butterfield, you are sitting in the seat that Julius Chambers once sat!” I didn’t know the significance of this statement until I met Julius, became his friend, and started following his career. Julius was a founding member of Ferguson, Stein & Chambers, the first integrated law firm in North Carolina. In courtrooms across America, Julius Chambers and his legal team litigated hundreds of cases to guarantee opportunity for African American citizens. In 1993, Julius became Chancellor at North Carolina Central University, his college alma mater.

The Republican tax plan that passed the House today eliminates personal deductions for medical expenses creating further hardship for people facing chronic illness; eliminates deductions for state and local income taxes resulting in higher taxes for people who cannot afford it; and eliminates deductions for interest paid on student loans making a quality education less accessible.  Tax reform should be bipartisan and provide protections for critical programs that working families and small businesses rely on, while ensuring that our country’s top earners and corporations pay their fair share of taxes.  That’s what the American people deserve.  I remain ready and willing to work across party lines to achieve responsible tax reform.  I urge the United States Senate to reject the House bill and work to achieve real results for the American people.","link","http://www.wral.com/gop-muscling-tax-bill-through-house-hits-senator-roadblock/17118150/","wral.com",37,60,67,2,2,1,19,101

House Republicans today voted to raise taxes on 86 million families in order to hand 83 percent of the tax benefits to the wealthiest one percent of Americans.  The Republican tax scam carries out yet another attack on health care, taking health insurance coverage from over 408,000 North Carolinians while adding another $1.5 trillion to our nation’s deficit.  At a time when the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Community Health Centers are running out of funding, and the lives of hundreds of thousands of Dreamers remain in peril, Republicans have prioritized tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy and will pay for it by slashing funding from important safety net programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.  This is wrong and does not reflect the best of who we are as a country.   Apparently, voting once on this tax scam wasn’t enough.  In their haste for a quick political win, yesterday Republicans pushed through a flawed bill that violated Senate rules, forcing the House to yet again vote to give huge handouts to the wealthiest Americans and to add more than a trillion dollars to the deficit.
