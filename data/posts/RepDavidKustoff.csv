Seven years ago, when the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, Americans were promised lower premiums, no tax increases, and more cost-effective options in the health care market.    President Obama promised that ‘if you like your health care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health care plan. Period.’   Now, we are seeing that government-mandated health care does not mean greater access to coverage.   Health care premiums have gone up by double digits in 31 states just this year. In Tennessee, premiums have risen an average of 63 percent. In some counties, premiums have risen as much as 116 percent. Additionally, 18 tax hikes were created under Obamacare.    Health care providers are dropping out of the exchange one after the other. One out of every three counties in America has just one insurer to choose from. Tennesseans know this all too well. Right now, 73 out of 95 counties in Tennessee, including Shelby County, have just one insurer on the health care exchange, and some areas, like Knox County, will have zero insurers next year.   As a result, only four percent of Tennesseans have health insurance on the Obamacare exchange.   Obamacare is collapsing, and doing nothing is not an option. This is simply not sustainable.   I believe everyone who wants health insurance should have access to it. This is not possible under Obamacare. We need to return the control of health care decisions to individuals and states.","status",NA,NA,27,89,8,0,0,0,5,11

With premiums rising and insurers dropping out of the exchange at an alarming rate, the failing health care law is in a death spiral. Republicans have promised to repeal this disastrous law and provide relief to the American people. Later today, I will vote to do just that.  The American Health Care Act will repeal the Affordable Care Act while reducing our deficit by $150 billion over the next ten years. AHCA will allow children to remain on their parents’ health insurance plans until they are 26 years old and makes it so no one can be denied coverage due to a preexisting condition. Starting in 2018, states will control Essential Health Benefits (EHB’s), instead of the federal government, allowing EHB’s to be defined locally and helping lower costs and expand choices. Additionally, AHCA will dedicate $15 billion to the Patient and State Stability Fund (PSSF) to provide resources for services covered in EHB’s, which includes maternity, mental health and substance abuse care.","status",NA,NA,40,340,8,1,1,2,7,73

Unfortunately, I do not believe this massive omnibus bill accomplishes either.    There are numerous provisions that I cannot support, such as funding for Planned Parenthood, medical marijuana programs and the bailout of Puerto Rico. I am also disappointed that the bill does not include cottonseed protection, which was thoroughly vetted, strongly supported and entirely paid for.

I promised the people of the Eighth Congressional District that I would work with my colleagues in Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare. With this legislation, we are keeping our word by repealing Obamacare while ensuring those with pre-existing conditions are protected and access to healthcare is expanded.    In Tennessee, every single insurance provider has pulled out of the individual market in 16 counties, affecting more than 1.1 million people.     Health care premiums have gone up by double digits in 31 states just this year with premiums in Tennessee rising an average of 63 percent. In some counties, premiums have risen as much as 116 percent with no ceiling in sight.      This bill will protect and ensure access to care for those with pre-existing conditions, and moreover, it will make health care more attainable with lower premiums.   It is important to remember that The American Health Care Act is a first step in a three-pronged process that will give the power back to the states and the American people where it belongs.","status",NA,NA,123,357,24,9,0,0,13,196

My colleague, Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, wrote a personal and thorough explanation of how AHCA will cover pre-existing conditions and return the decision-making back to individuals and families.   “With Obamacare, our health- insurance system relies on younger, healthier people subsidizing the costs of the older and sicker. As a result, insurance costs consistently increase to cover the costs of people who are considered “high-risk,” namely those who are sick or who have preexisting conditions. High-risk pools and reinsurance programs at the state level address this concern and have been successful in the past. Our plan establishes a program to provide federal resources for states to create high-risk pools, reduce out-of-pocket costs or promote better access to services. States know better than the federal government how to allocate and manage resources to address the needs of their people. Our plan allows states to serve and provide financial support directly to vulnerable populations, including people with preexisting conditions.”","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/my-son-has-a-preexisting-condition-hes-one-of-the-reasons-i-voted-for-the-ahca/2017/05/04/26c234b2-30fd-11e7-9534-00e4656c22aa_story.html?utm_term=.297c245a67f6","washingtonpost.com",42,154,29,0,0,0,7,51

Unfortunately, the “mounting and systemic problems” within the Affordable Care Act have forced them to stop offering this insurance plan.  I applaud Anthony Kimbrough, CEO of TRHH, for maintaining coverage for more than 49,000 Tennesseans through grandfathered plans and for continuing to offer Farm Bureau Health Plans to new members.

With regards to recertification of compliance – If Iran has not violated the nuclear agreement, it is because the JCPOA is deeply flawed, as it was poorly negotiated by the Obama Administration. This agreement does not adequately deter Iran’s missile development or unacceptable aggressive behavior.
