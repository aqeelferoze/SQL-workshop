According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 70 percent of adults who misuse prescription opioids find them in their friends’ and relatives’ medicine cabinets.  You can help fight this epidemic by getting unused prescriptions out of your cabinet and making sure that they are properly disposed of.   As part of the Take Back Initiative, the Drug Enforcement Administration, in conjunction with many local Sheriff’s offices and other community partners, are hosting sites where prescriptions can be dropped off.  Below is a list of the registered sites within the 15th District that are participating this Saturday.

That is the number of veterans currently living in the 15th Congressional District. And there are thousands more who are actively serving our nation in the military today fighting for the principles, freedoms, and liberties we are so lucky to enjoy. And there are countless more whose dedication, service, and sacrifice live on in the memories of those who knew them best.   This project is a collection of their stories. No two stories are alike; they span across the district – from Madison County to Morgan County, and they span across eras – from the First World War to the War on Terror. For most, their time in the military was positive and gratifying, for some, it was more difficult. Regardless, their service impacted each of them, and it impacts all of us. All those who serve deserve the recognition and thanks of our entire nation.   As a Brigadier General in the Ohio Army National Guard, and as your Representative in Congress, I have had the pleasure to meet many service members and veterans over the years. I believe that telling their stories is one of the best and most important ways to honor their sacrifice.
