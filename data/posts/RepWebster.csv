In keeping with comments made during the campaign, he outlined his vision for reviving our economy – including investing in infrastructure and removing regulations that are crushing small businesses and stifling job creation. In just five weeks, working together Congress and President Trump have already cut $2.8 billion by rolling back over-burdensome regulations. The President’s commitment to improving infrastructure offers unique opportunity to build 21st century infrastructure for our district and America.   The President is right, Obamacare is imploding. We must repeal and replace it with a 21st century healthcare system that provides Americans with the care they need, from the doctor they choose, at a price they can afford.    I was thrilled to see Floridian, Denisha Merriweather, as one of his special guests. Her story is a great example of the power of school choice. It has transformed the lives of countless students in Florida and can transform American education. I couldn’t agree more with President Trump’s comments on the power of education. His support for school choice is great news for every parent who is seeking the financial freedom to send their child to the school that meet their needs.","status",NA,NA,187,40,11,8,0,1,0,5

From being the home of our nation’s most famed space missions, to our booming technology and world-class health care facilities, and consistently top-ranked public universities in the nation, Florida has lead the way in medical innovations, space research, and science and technology.  Florida is a state that mirrors the diversity of our nation, where entire communities going back generations meet the immigrants that chose Florida as the launching point for the American dream. Our state is one of opportunity for our young people and our veterans, just as it is a welcoming place for people with a life long and well lived.

This is critical to the access some of our senior population has to Florida nursing homes. Florida is a very efficient state when it comes to providing Medicaid services, however we are among the fastest growing states in the nation. Many seniors depend on Medicaid-funded nursing home beds when their Medicare coverage runs out. I continue to work with leadership and am still hopeful for a solution before the bill comes up for a vote.","link","https://www.villages-news.com/seniors-depend-medicaid-funded-nursing-home-beds-medicare-runs/","villages-news.com",90,148,22,1,0,4,3,9

Trump for signing the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017. This is the first step in ensuring our veterans receive the highest quality and swiftest care from the Veterans administration.   The 2014 VA scandal stands out as one of the most egregious failures of providing our veterans with the care they deserve. Over the last several years, Congress has passed several reform bills with bipartisan support, only to see these bills die in the Senate. The Obama administration’s plan for our veterans was full of broken promises and tragic results.   But now, with strong Republican majorities in both chambers and a staunch pro-veteran President in the White House, we are taking swift action to end the atrocious failures. Our first action is to remove inappropriate regulations that make it impossible to hold accountable those VA employees who do not provide our veterans with the quality of service they have earned. The bill also establishes the Office of Accountability, which forbids the VA Secretary from retaliating against whistleblowers who have filed complaints within the VA general counsel’s office.","status",NA,NA,114,32,7,9,1,0,0,7

I am committed to doing everything I can to protect life – especially when it comes to our most vulnerable, the unborn.   Science increasingly confirms that unborn babies feel pain by at least 20 weeks. Unborn children do indeed feel the pain of dismemberment abortion procedures. Conventional medical practices already take this into consideration.   Disgracefully, the US is one of only seven countries that allows the abortion of a child after 20 weeks, along with regimes that are known human rights abusers such as North Korea.   I mourn the loss of the 55 million children who have been aborted in the U.S. since 1973, who never had the opportunity achieve the potential inherent in every human life. I mourn for their families, who never had the joy of knowing them. I mourn for our nation, which will never benefit from the lives and the love of these children, who would have been our brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, our friends, and our neighbors.   I cast my vote in favor today in the House and I hope the Senate takes swift action. The overwhelming majority of Americans support protecting the lives of unborn children after 20 weeks.

Under the previous administration, our military was drastically downsized and its ability to maintain state-of-the-art weapons systems was diminished. The signing of the NDAA signals a reversal of course for our military; the bill has many important provisions worth highlighting.  The NDAA increases funding for our military with an aim toward reversing the military readiness crisis that has been developing for the past several years. It also provides the largest pay raise for our troops in 8 years and includes an increase in size of all of our Armed Services.  The signing of the FY 2018 NDAA is just a down payment on what must be a multi-year commitment to bringing our military back to an appropriate strength.

This bill specifically extends funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for a period of 5 years through the 2022 Fiscal Year and extends funding for Federally Qualified Health Centers for 2 years through the 2019 Fiscal Year.  H.R. 3922 now rests in the hands of the Senate. I urge my congressional colleagues on the Senate side to move forward with the reauthorization for CHIP, just as we did in the House of Representatives.  CHIP is a federally-funded program that provides health coverage to targeted low-income children and some pregnant women in families that have no health insurance but are above Medicaid income level eligibility. The states are responsible for administering CHIP. Federal CHIP funding expired on September 30, 2017. After the expiration of Fiscal Year 2017 funds, and until the provision of FY2018 funds, states are able to use redistributed funds and unspent allotments to continue to provide healthcare coverage. Earlier this month, the House passed a spending bill (a continuing resolution, also commonly called CR) that included  funding for CHIP.  During my service as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, the state legislature began Florida KidCare. Through Florida KidCare, the state of Florida offers health insurance for children from birth through age 18, based on age and family income. Our health care system should ensure access to health coverage for all Americans, rein in costs, solve insurance challenges of portability and pre-existing illness, and allow our health care professionals to improve health care delivery through innovation.  I am committed to ensuring that our safety net is available to those who are most in need. Taking care of our children is imperative and is the basis of my support for strengthening Medicaid. We should empower our state leaders to make decisions that they believe will best serve the needs of our state.  I also want to share the following article, published by the Washington Post. It provides information and context in response to recent comments by Jimmy Kimmel.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/12/13/fact-checking-jimmy-kimmel-on-chip-funding/?utm_term=.73de6c581deb","washingtonpost.com",56,26,9,4,2,2,0,2
