In 2012, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act was passed into law. This bipartisan reform allowed – but did not require – states to administer drug tests to those applying for unemployment insurance benefits. Unemployment insurance applicants are required by law to be able and available for employment, and drug testing is one of the most effective ways to ensure applicants meet this requirement.   This law was also intended to reassure employers and taxpayers who fund the unemployment insurance program that those claiming the benefits were truly ready to be hired and work.   In the years following the passage of this law, the Department of Labor failed to issue a rule to implement it. But in the final months of the Obama Administration, the Department of Labor issued a final rule that severely limited states’ ability to drug test unemployment insurance applicants. In issuing this rule, the Department of Labor acted outside their authority and went against the clear intent of Congress.  H.J.Res. 42 would provide for disapproval of this rule through the Congressional Review Act. This is needed to remove this overreaching rule and allow for the original intent of the law to be fully implemented. States are in the best position to determine how to efficiently and effectively administer unemployment insurance programs, and should be allowed to drug test applicants if they choose to do so.","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanBuddyCarter/videos/1228191960633040/",NA,38,34,3,0,0,0,0,4

In 2015, 19.2 million taxpayers elected to pay the mandate penalty or claim a hardship exemption. It’s true: 6.5 million individuals paid the penalty while an additional 12.7 claimed a hardship exemption, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In contrast, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reported that 10.4 million individuals enrolled in an Obamacare exchange plan through the first half of 2016.  But that’s not the whole story. The individual mandate is also failing to move younger, healthier Americans to buy health insurance, which is contributing to Obamacare’s “death spiral.” Of those taxpayers sidestepping the individual mandate, 45 percent of them were under the age of 35.

One of the many reasons Obamacare failed is that it focused on forcing Americans into coverage they did not want and could not afford. Our plan instead is designed to empower Americans to access quality, affordable, and patient-centered health care.  It is important to remember the report released scores just one piece of our plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. I have said from the beginning AHCA is just the first of many steps to rescue our health care system. There will be administrative relief as well as additional legislation to complete our plan. The CBO report released absolutely does not capture the whole picture about what is actually going to happen to our health care system and it should not be treated that way.","link","http://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1623","buddycarter.house.gov",51,99,5,2,4,4,2,16

""Let’s set the record straight: First, despite hyperventilating headlines, Internet service providers have never planned to sell your individual browsing history to third parties. That’s simply not how online advertising works. And doing so would violate ISPs’ privacy promises. Second, Congress’s decision last week didn’t remove existing privacy protections; it simply cleared the way for us to work together to reinstate a rational and effective system for protecting consumer privacy.  Both of us warned two years ago that the FCC’s party-line vote to strip the Federal Trade Commission of its jurisdiction over Internet broadband providers was a mistake that would weaken Americans’ online privacy. Up until that decision, the FTC was an effective cop on the privacy beat, using a consistent framework for protecting privacy and data security throughout the entire Internet ecosystem. Indeed, under that framework, the FTC carried out more than 150 enforcement actions, including actions against some of the nation’s largest Internet companies.""

The primary responsibility of the federal government is to provide for the safety and security of the American people. This legislation contains the biggest increase in border security funding in a decade and begins to rebuild our national defense infrastructure.  Most importantly, it broke the long-held demand of Washington Democrats for level increases between defense and non-defense programs.  Overall the spending package contains an additional $25 billion for national security over last year’s spending level.  That includes $76.8 billion for troops deployed in the fight against ISIS and $123.3 billion to rebuild military bases and restore readiness that faltered under the Obama Administration.  Additionally, the bill provides $12.2 billion in law enforcement infrastructure to secure the nation’s border.  The world class defense facilities in South and Coastal Georgia are not only critical for our national security but for the long term economic vitality of our area. This bill provides the largest pay increase in six years for our troops.  It keeps the A-10s flying at Moody, continues the conversion of the 2nd Infantry Combat Brigade Team at Fort Stewart, and continues programs we need for the future of Kings Bay and Hunter Army Airfield.  It also invests in the future of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center and funds much-needed repairs at Coast Guard facilities still recovering from Hurricane Matthew.   Finally, Georgia’s deepwater ports in Savannah and Brunswick also garnered much-needed federal support in the legislation.  The Savannah Harbor Expansion Project is set to receive an additional $42.7 million to continue construction.  The Ports of Savannah and Brunswick will receive a combined $28 million for ongoing maintenance.   Our ports are the economic engines of not just our area and not just our state but of the entire region. This bill keeps them chugging along and continues work on Georgia’s number one economic development initiative: the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project.","link","http://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1902","buddycarter.house.gov",63,56,3,3,0,1,0,11

For the last seven years, I have watched the health care system that I worked in for more than thirty years crumble under its own weight. Thanks to Obamacare, premiums and health care costs have skyrocketed, choice has been eliminated, and the dire situation is only getting worse. At home in Georgia, 96 counties only have one insurer to choose from on the exchange. That isn't a choice at all. With passage of the AHCA today, we are another step closer to delivering relief and a patient-centered health care system with the choice and control needed to empower patients.   This bill guts Obamacare and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to act swiftly to let families and patients across America know that help is on the way. The AHCA will ensure patients are no longer forced to live under Washington's one-size-fits-all health care mandates and taxes and it should be signed into law as soon as possible.  I look forward to continuing our work to resuscitate our health care system. As I have always said, the AHCA is a strong first step, but I'm committed it's not the last. The House has already passed additional legislation to lower health insurance costs and take the first step toward allowing the purchase of insurance across state lines and more action is coming. Today is a big win in the fight to repeal and replace Obamacare and it won't be the last.","link","http://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1903","buddycarter.house.gov",290,267,66,24,4,0,12,165

Phase 2 includes critical workforce conducting life safety operations and essential infrastructure emergency support personnel. These personnel have been supplied with a green critical workforce disaster re-entry permit. A form of personal ID, such as a driver’s license, and a business ID with your name will suffice for re-entry. If you do not already have a critical workforce pass, none will be given out this week.  Damage assessments are currently in progress. While crews work uninterrupted by traffic, every minute Glynn County limits access increases the speed of recovery exponentially. It is still not safe to be out and about in the county.  Law enforcement personnel at various checkpoints will be restricting reentry to those who do not meet the requirements for Phase 2 entry.

My legislation authorizes federal agencies that make a mistake in calculating military service deposits and pensions to pay the incorrectly accrued interest on behalf of veteran employees.  I introduced this legislation because I have heard from veterans faced with this unacceptable problem. After serving our nation, veterans are moving on to work for federal agencies and these agencies are miscalculating their pensions, accruing thousands of dollars in interest without the veteran ever even knowing about it.   Our current system requires these veterans to repay sometimes tens of thousands of dollars in interest due to no fault of their own. My legislation says federal agencies, not our brave veterans, should pay the interest payments when the federal government is responsible for the miscalculation.   This is not how our veterans should be treated when they return home and it should not be allowed to continue.","link","https://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2685","buddycarter.house.gov",42,12,1,0,0,0,0,0
