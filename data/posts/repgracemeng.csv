My heart breaks to see these vicious acts of anti-Semitism, and I believe that Congress must not only denounce these heinous acts, but do everything in its power to prevent them.   Jewish community centers and facilities continue to be vulnerable to hate crimes, which is why I consistently support increased funding for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP), which provides eligible 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations with funding support for target-hardening and other physical security enhancements and activities. I’m proud that a number of institutions in Queens have been able to use this program, and I encourage all eligible organizations, in Queens and around the country, to apply.   No one should have to see the gravesite of a loved one or a community member vandalized, a principle I fought for in my first term.

His first month has been tumultuous at best, from the chaotic implementation of his disgraceful travel ban to the resignation of his National Security Advisor to his self-inflicted war with the media.  Tonight he spoke of tax reform that would mainly help wealthy corporations, not working men and women. His continued push for a border wall would not fix our broken immigration system. He talked about supporting law enforcement and victims of crime but won’t support gun safety legislation. His insistence on a repeal and replace of Obamacare that would expand choice and lower costs is not realistic. Congressional Republicans have not offered any replacement plans that would meet those criteria.             I agree with President Trump that we must do more to find solutions to problems such as infrastructure investment, affordable childcare, paid family leave and helping our veterans.

The plan slashes Medicaid funding for the most vulnerable, including children, individuals with disabilities, seniors, and pregnant women, while providing tax breaks for the wealthy, CEOs, and pharmaceutical companies. There is a reason why this bill was kept secret for so long, because it will have a devastating impact on hardworking families. The CBO numbers speak for themselves: 14 million Americans will lose insurance by next year alone, and another 10 million by 2026. Premiums will increase through 2020.

His budget claims to put “America First,” but I fail to see how slashing funding by $54 billion dollars for our most vulnerable citizens is patriotic. The budget calls for a complete elimination of essential programs such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps low income families, particularly those with children or senior citizens in the home, with energy costs during cold winter and hot summer months. This program provides critical heating and cooling support to over 1 million New York households. Other programs will have their funding restricted, such as the Meals on Wheels program, which provides food to impoverished older and disabled Americans who can’t leave their homes.    Every single American would be negatively impacted in some way by this budget, whether it be through the elimination of community development programs that assist at-risk communities both rural and urban; deep cuts to the National Institutes of Health, which conducts research to find cures for devastating diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease; continued exposure to toxic waste due to slashed funding for the Environmental Protection Agency that cleans up these waste sites; or the termination of before- and after- school programs, particularly in high poverty areas.    My constituents deserve better than this budget. America deserves better than this budget. And I will not stop until I see something workable on the table.","link","http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/16/what-does-trump-budget-eliminate/99223182/","usatoday.com",227,39,47,19,1,1,3,23

S.J. Res 34 would repeal these rules and allow ISPs to sell sensitive data without the consumer’s consent. Americans should have a right to protect their personal information. Repealing the FCC rules is a mistake.","link","http://wapo.st/2mNEzXo","apo.st",288,28,36,11,0,2,3,13

Even though nothing about Donald Trump’s presidency has been typical, I have still been vastly disappointed by his performance. He has yet to accomplish anything significant, and many of his actions have been appalling.   Instead of working with Congress to improve our health care system, create jobs, and fix our crumbling infrastructure, President Trump chose to issue executive orders and push legislation that harm American families. We have seen two racist Muslim bans rightly fail in the courts, a disastrous bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act that would have raised costs and left millions uninsured, and a budget plan that puts America last by squeezing the middle class and slashing investment in our nation’s future. Furthermore, President Trump has not even done the most basic part of his job by appointing individuals to the empty positions in his administration—there are still thousands of positions left to fill.   I strive to listen to and be a voice for my constituents every day. I have worked with House Republicans, and will continue to do so when possible, to advance our shared goals, such as infrastructure investment, affordable childcare, and adequate services for our veterans. If President Trump truly values these priorities, where has he been the past 100 days?   After President Trump’s disastrous legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act imploded, he said, ""nobody knew health care could be so complicated."" Anyone who works in a medical field or who has struggled to find quality and affordable health care could tell you otherwise. But it is not just health care that is complicated, it is governing. To govern successfully, you have to bring legitimate ideas to the table and work across the aisle. You have to listen.","status",NA,NA,95,22,9,6,0,0,6,2

This increase will allow the Center to hire three additional staff members and to continue to serve as the leading voice on the Asian Pacific American experience, as well as host events in cities across the country.   The spending bill provides no funding for President Trump’s border wall with Mexico and does not cut funding to Planned Parenthood or sanctuary cities.   As a New York member of the House Appropriations Committee, it’s important to me that the bill reimburses New York City for the costs associated with protecting President Trump and the First Family. These costs for the security of Trump Tower should be paid for by the federal government. It should not be on the back of New York taxpayers nor should it further strain our needed police resources. I thank the mayor for noting my work on this effort.   In addition, the Omnibus bill permanently extends retired health benefits for miners, provides $2 billion to the National Institutes of Health, and reinstates year-round Pell grants.   Though this bill is not perfect, the American people deserve better than the alternatives of another stopgap funding measure or a government shutdown.

Certainly not rural Americans, who will see critical rural cooperative and manufacturing programs completely eliminated, and deep cuts to economic development partnerships such as the Appalachian Regional Commission. Certainly not Americans who are sick, especially children and those with disabilities, who will see drastic cuts to Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, the latter providing health coverage to 5.6 million children. This is not to mention the $6 billion cuts to federally-funded medical research, an essential investment to finding cures for the most devastating diseases.   Who will benefit from this budget? The wealthiest Americans, who will see generous tax cuts at the expense of middle class families and those who are particularly vulnerable. This budget takes an axe to safety net programs, including stripping away programs such as LIHEAP which provides critical heating and cooling assistance to millions across the country, many among them seniors.   We can spend responsibly, judiciously, and compassionately on both domestic and military spending, but this budget does none of these things.","link","https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-05-23/trump-seeks-3-6-trillion-in-spending-cuts-to-reshape-government","bloomberg.com",29,3,6,0,1,1,4,10

President Trump has proposed cutting NSF’s budget by a whopping 11% at a time in which there are 13 vacant STEM jobs for every available STEM worker in the United States. This is disinvesting in our economy, disinvesting in our kids, disinvesting in innovation, and disinvesting in our future.

TrumpCare would not only leave 22 million Americans uninsured, it would strip away crucial health protections that every American should be able to have and afford, such as coverage for trips to the emergency room, maternity care, prescription drugs, and mental health services. It would also eliminate protections against capping health care coverage at certain lifetime or annual dollar amounts.  Today, I spoke for Alexander, a young New Yorker who was mugged on the street and accrued $28,000 in hospital bills. Without the protections provided by the ACA against lifetime limits for coverage, Alexander would have been left on his own to cover thousands of dollars, all because of an attack he never asked for. No one deserves that.  President Trump called the House version of this bill “mean” and said he wanted to see a bill with “heart.” That is not what is in front of us. There is not a single advocacy group fighting for the passage of this bill because it has no heart and benefits no one who needs it. We will fight with everything we have to prevent its passage. #MyHealthMyFuture","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repgracemeng/photos/a.197092777102152.60336.195734010571362/1107125129432241/?type=3",NA,163,16,6,9,0,0,2,1

In 2009, DOD began the Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) program to recruit foreign-born individuals whose skills are considered vital to our national interest. The Pentagon is reportedly considering canceling enlistment contracts for 1,000 MAVNI recruits which could lead to their deportation. MAVNI recruits have contractually agreed to place their lives on the line to protect every American citizen.  I think the President would agree that it is only right that we honor our contract with them, and that we allow these individuals to continue to live in America once their service has concluded.","link","http://bit.ly/2ufYbCE","bit.ly",161,11,25,14,0,0,0,0

What transpired was not only wholly un-American, against the very core of who we are as a nation and the values we hold dear, but also very likely illegal and a gross violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act. No person can accept contributions of any kind from a foreign national in connection with an election, period.  Donald Trump, Jr. published his email correspondence cited by the New York Times, but what else is being kept in the dark? What other meetings and exchanges do we not know about?

Let’s be clear, DACA protected individuals who were brought to this country as children and who subsequently obeyed the law. Many earned degrees from American high schools and universities, and some even served in our military. These are exactly the type of individuals America should embrace, not turn away.  Robert F. Kennedy once remarked: ‘Our attitude towards immigration reflects our faith in the American ideal.

Neither race nor place of birth should affect their chances.’ As an elected Representative of Queens, New York, and as the daughter of immigrants myself, I know this to be true. America is not so small, or insecure, or diminished that it has no place for the next generation of dreamers and seekers within its borders. It is still, even despite today’s decision, a great nation. And our political leaders should begin conducting themselves as such.  As a Member of Congress, I will do everything in my power over the next six months to fight on behalf Dreamers everywhere, and to ensure that today’s profoundly irresponsible decision is reversed.”","status",NA,NA,235,51,18,32,2,0,18,6

Thirty percent of the households in my district rely on this critical deduction to get back an average of $11,000 per year.   The budget resolution would jeopardize the health care of seniors, children, the disabled, and veterans. It disinvests in our future by slashing funding for education, infrastructure, and medical research. It cuts Medicare by $473 billion, Medicaid by $1 trillion, infrastructure spending by almost $200 billion, and Pell Grants by more than $100 billion, all while increasing the deficit by $1.5 trillion through tax cut proposals to provide a break to the wealthiest on the backs of hardworking American families.

The Trump Administration requested that fiscal year 2018 funding levels to USAID be reduced by more than a third, even though USAID receives less than 1% of the entire federal budget. This slashing of funding poses both humanitarian and national security concerns. Terrorist organizations are most likely to thrive in nations where infrastructure is weak, people do not have opportunities for economic growth, and community morale is low.   Women, girls, and children are disproportionately impacted during humanitarian crises. Women and girls are often prevented from getting an education and participating in the economy, furthering instability, due to poor sanitation surrounding menstruation. And a quarter of the world’s children live in conflict or disaster stricken countries. I asked Administrator Green: 1) how USAID will ensure economic opportunities for women and girls by addressing menstrual hygiene management in its programs; and 2) how USAID will ensure that children are protected from exploitation and violence. He replied that USAID is committed to addressing menstrual hygiene management, that empowering women and girls is a key part of its programming, and that it will continue to address the needs of children through law enforcement, awareness building, and victim services so that children do not fall prey to terrible influences.   It is critical that USAID funding remain robust so that it can address these and many other pressing humanitarian, development, and security issues.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repgracemeng/photos/a.448814571929970.1073741846.195734010571362/1190696207741799/?type=3",NA,26,1,1,1,0,0,2,1

There are so many ways that this bill undercuts hardworking American families while lining the pockets of billionaires and corporate special interests. It dismantles the state and local income tax deduction that is critical for working families, but keeps it in place for big corporations. It imposes restrictions on the mortgage interest deduction that helps homebuyers fulfill the American Dream of homeownership, but phases out the estate tax for billionaires. It eliminates the student loan interest deduction that helps young people get an education to further their careers, but allows big companies to deduct moving costs of sending jobs overseas.

The NIH is not investing enough resources to finding a cure for a virus which chronically affects 2 million people across the country, and which leads to thousands of deaths each year. Hepatitis B is also of particular concern to minority communities who are disproportionately impacted by the virus. Despite these alarming statistics, NIH research funding for hepatitis B has declined by 12.5 percent since 2012.

Through every version, it was patently obvious that corporate special interests and the wealthiest Americans were always intended to be the beneficiaries of this bill, leaving scraps for everyone else. The bill permanently slashes taxes for corporations while RAISING taxes on millions of middle class families across the country. The bill dismantles deductions for state and local taxes for individuals, unfairly punishing families in states like New York who will have to pay thousands more each year. Senate Republicans even rejected a Republican-led amendment that would have increased the child tax credit for low-income parents all because it would have raised the corporate tax rate by less than one percent.
