The American people have made themselves clear. They want responsible, efficient government spending, with smart investments in programs that work.   Instead, the President has proposed a bizarre, ideological budget. His reckless cuts would cut thriving, successful programs to pay for tax cuts for millionaires – instead of the small businesses that really need them. He wants to slash the basic programs that keep Texas drinking water clean, stop diseases from spreading, and care for vulnerable seniors.  Of the areas with the greatest percentage of residents on food stamps, 7 out of 10 voted for President Trump, hoping he would help them achieve a better life. Yet instead of investing in economic opportunities, he is threatening to make even less food available to our poorest families – including his voters.   Fortunately, the President does not control the federal budget. Congress does. I work with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to craft a reasonable, bipartisan budget that serves all Americans, encourages job creation, and protects veterans and seniors.”","link","http://cuellar.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=401221","cuellar.house.gov",50,21,6,0,0,0,7,2

Even current and former law enforcement and military members with Secret and Top Secret security clearances, must go through this laborious and failure-prone process.  The Anti-Border Corruption Reuthorization Act of 2017 would streamline the hiring process for current ‘cleared’ federal employees, law enforcement, or military members to join CBP after their background check, without having to go through a redundant polygraph.
