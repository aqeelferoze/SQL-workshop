He now has the awesome privilege and responsibility of leading the strongest, most resilient nation on Earth.  He isn’t just the president of those who voted for him, he is the President of the United States of America.    Our nation faces many complex economic, security, and technological challenges and the President’s decisions and actions will have a profound impact on people’s lives and our nation’s future.   I am determined to uphold our national values and global alliances.  As I always have, I will try to help build bridges rather than walls, and advance policies that expand opportunity for all Americans, not just the wealthy few.   That was one of the darkest inauguration speeches I have ever heard.  President Trump’s inaugural message briefly touched on unity, but for many Rhode Islanders his past words and deeds are rightfully worrisome.  It is his responsibility to serve all Americans with respect.   It is incumbent upon all of us to be engaged in our country’s future, to confront injustice, and to hold our leaders accountable.  In our democratic system of checks and balances, the greatest check of all is the American people.    America is constantly undergoing periods of renewal and realignment.  What remains constant is the pillars of our democracy and the strength of our people.  We can’t let apathy and cynicism set in.

A thorough vetting system developed since 9/11 is already in place and refugees are among the most heavily scrutinized of all people who enter our country.  This amounts to a new religious test.  It is wrong, ‎unconstitutional, and will do nothing to keep us safe.   In order to defeat ISIL, al Qaeda, and other terrorist groups, we need cooperation from the Muslim world.  President Trump’s irresponsible action hurts our alliances and undermines our security.   The people targeted by this unnecessary action are fleeing the same violent extremists who would seek to disrupt our way of life.  These are people who look to the United States to offer a safe harbor, people who, in many cases, put their lives on the line in support of American military objectives.  Turning our backs on those in need is not the American way.   If President Trump’s plan becomes standard U.S. policy, it will be a blow to all Americans.  Many Republicans repudiated this kind of thing last fall and now they are standing by in complicit silence.  Regardless of one’s political party, it is time to keep faith with the Constitution and reject this religious ban before it spreads.‎‎","status",NA,NA,1431,230,268,89,2,1,20,10

It is a crucial check on the power of both the executive and legislative branches.    Senate Republicans did a great disservice to the nation, and this nominee, when they took the unprecedented and extreme step of blocking President Obama’s moderate Supreme Court nominee for nearly a year.  As a result, many Americans question this nomination.     Judge Gorsuch’s record in the lower court suggests he could impose significant new constraints on civil liberties, women’s rights and workers’ rights, and roll back consumer protections and clean air laws.  I am concerned that Judge Gorsuch has a tendency to favor the interests of big corporations and special interests over every day Americans.  The American people deserve an opportunity to learn more about this nominee and whether he is committed to upholding their rights.  As I stated when Merrick Garland was nominated by President Obama: There is plenty of room for tough questions and respectful debate in this process.  All of President Obama’s Supreme Court nominees cleared a sixty vote threshold and President Trump’s nominee should adhere to the same standard.","status",NA,NA,368,118,46,11,1,1,5,3

We need a bipartisan commitment to helping middle-class families.  But when it comes to education, health care, tax cuts, and so many kitchen table issues, President Trump prioritizes policies that will undermine working families.  About ninety percent of America’s students attend public schools, but President Trump wants to divert taxpayer dollars toward private schools.  On health care, he got both the diagnosis and the prescription wrong: repealing the Affordable Care Act will drive up health care costs for all Americans.  The President paid lip service to clean air and clean water, but he has already begun an assault on our environmental laws and plans to dismantle the EPA.  It took years of hard work and tough choices to strengthen the foundation of our economy and get it back on track.  Over the last eight years, 15 million jobs were created, the stock market roared back, companies once mired in recession rebounded, the deficit fell, energy independence surged, and millions more got access to affordable health care.  President Trump’s economic plan jeopardizes this progress.  His policies are geared toward short-term gains for corporations and the wealthiest and long-term pain for American workers and taxpayers.     President Trump has a serious credibility problem.  He tries to take credit for jobs he didn’t create, and, with respect to the F-35 program, savings that were achieved before he even took office.    In terms of national security, President Trump’s first month in office has been marred by dysfunction.  He has strained relations with key allies.  He also needs to understand that by retreating from the world stage, he is giving other nations the opportunity to increase their influence.     If the President wants to show the American people he is serious about national security, he’ll take back Steve Bannon’s seat from the permanent National Security Council and return it to the non-partisan Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  President Trump didn’t mention Russia in his speech tonight, but Americans cannot afford to turn a blind eye to Russian interference in our democracy.  We need to get to the facts and learn lessons to prevent future misconduct by foreign governments.  But this Administration and its allies are throwing up roadblocks to a fair, impartial investigation.  We need bipartisan action in Congress to ensure no foreign attack on our electoral process goes unchecked.  As with any speech, the devil is in the details.  Now, in the days ahead, President Trump needs to start sharing some of those details.","status",NA,NA,370,97,61,13,3,0,4,14

It turns out Jeff Sessions didn’t provide that in his testimony, but he must do so now.  At a bare minimum, Attorney General Sessions needs to recuse himself and an independent special prosecutor must be put in place to probe the serious and mounting allegations about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives and officials.  After misleading Congress, Attorney General Sessions is incapable of leading the investigation. In fact, he could be a subject of it.  Jeff Sessions knows he should have disclosed these meetings before his confirmation vote. Now he needs to answer legitimate questions about his actions and why he withheld this information.  This also goes beyond the Attorney General. The President needs to come clean and Republicans in Congress need to put the good of our country and the strength of our democracy ahead of partisan interests.

This CBO report offers further evidence that Trumpcare is the wrong prescription for America’s health care system and would result in millions more Americans being uninsured.   This is even worse than most Republicans worried, and I hope it will cause thoughtful members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to thoroughly examine this non-partisan analysis.  The CBO report also acknowledges that out of pocket costs and deductibles will go up. Costs will rise for millions of Americans, and the federal government, comparatively, will save very little, while the cost burden is shifted to states.  Trumpcare is a bad deal for Americans and a steal for the insurance industry.    I urge Republicans to scrap this version of Trumpcare and work with Democrats to improve the Affordable Care Act.","status",NA,NA,191,51,31,0,0,3,10,26

It also raises more questions than answers about Russia’s efforts to manipulate our election and undermine the stability of our democratic institutions.   We know a hostile foreign power wanted to undermine our democracy, hurt Hillary Clinton, and help Donald Trump. But the American people deserve to know how, why, and whether any American citizens were complicit in aiding and abetting them.   The President should start by admitting he was wrong and apologize to President Obama about the claims of “wiretapping.”  Next, he should release his tax returns. Investigators must scrutinize any banking or monetary links between Russian operatives, the Trump Organization, the Trump campaign, and its affiliated outside groups.   Republicans in Congress need to put the good of our country and the strength of our democracy ahead of partisan interests. If Republicans impede fair and open investigations into this matter, then Russia will continue its misconduct. We already know Russia is now replicating it’s playbook against our European allies.

This action could paralyze the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s alleged collusion with Russian officials, and the Trump Organization’s potential ties to Russian interests.   The explanation from the White House is highly implausible and the timing and circumstances surrounding this decision raise serious questions about the President’s motives.  President Trump knew about the supposed grounds for Director Comey’s termination when he invited Director Comey to join the Administration, and the explanations coming from the Justice Department now just don’t add up.  The only way we can resolve this situation now is with a special prosecutor.  The investigation must be overseen by someone the President cannot fire at will.   The Trump Administration has demonstrated a pattern of ignoring precedent and moving forward in a way that is most beneficial to their political self-interest.  It is worth noting that many officials involved in this investigation have either been removed from their posts or have been forced to recuse themselves due to personal involvement.  This process needs to be moved out of the political realm and into the hands of an independent special prosecutor.","status",NA,NA,769,167,144,7,2,15,5,73

Last year, over 7 million students nationwide, including 30,000 Rhode Island students, benefited from over $28 billion in Pell Grants.  This school year, Rhode Island students benefited from approximately $107 million in Pell Grants, which are named after Rhode Island’s own former U.S. Senator Claiborne Pell.  Unfortunately, we’ve seen an erosion in the efficacy of the grants as college costs have risen and outstripped the funding the grants provide.  In 1976, the maximum Pell Grant covered roughly 72 percent of the cost of tuition, fees, and room and board at a four-year college, today it covers less than 30 percent of those costs.  Even worse, President Trump’s budget would effectively decrease funding for Pell Grants by nearly $4 billion, failing both students and society as a whole.   Today, I joined Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, students, and educators at CCRI’s Knight Campus to discuss the Pell Grant Preservation & Expansion Act, legislation we introduced with our colleagues to increase the maximum award for low-income students, ensure that awards keep pace with inflation, and make other improvements to expand and permanently safeguard the Pell Grant program.  We heard directly from students and education experts about challenges and solutions regarding the student financial aid process.

As a result, Putin is likely to continue meddling in democratic elections across the globe and here at home and that is unacceptable.   “There appear to be conflicting readouts of the meeting, but based on post-meeting statements by both Secretary Tillerson and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, on the issue of Russian interference in our democracy, President Trump capitulated to Vladimir Putin.     “Secretary Tillerson said that President Trump “pressed him [Putin] and then felt like at this point, ‘let’s talk about how to move forward.’”  Putin and Trump may both wish to ‘move forward,’ but the American people and the rest of the free world are all saying ‘wait a minute, let’s figure out what happened here and how to protect ourselves from repeat offenses.’    “President Trump may have accepted Putin’s assurances that Russia did not meddle in the U.S. presidential election, but I can assure you that the American people do not share his confidence in Mr. Putin’s claims.   “The crucial work of U.S. intelligence agencies, law enforcement, the special counsel, and bipartisan Congressional panels will continue until we get to the bottom of what happened and can help prevent continued Russian interference in future democratic elections.   “Despite the fact that U.S. intelligence agencies unanimously concur that Putin oversaw a concerted Russian effort to interfere in our 2016 president election to help Donald Trump defeat Hillary Clinton, President Trump continued to muddy the waters before this meeting by declaring that: “Nobody really knows for sure.”  Putin’s goal is to undermine confidence in the United States and those types of statements from the President help Putin.    “The one positive takeaway from this meeting is the framework for a ceasefire in parts of Syria.  Any time there’s a positive attempt to lower the level of violence there it should be encouraged.  But these cease fires have been brokered in the past and quickly fallen apart.  I was over in Syria a few weeks ago and the issues there are extremely complicated.  This announcement will be a test of how effectively the Russians can influence both the Syrian and Iranian governments to stop the violence and begin to develop longer-term solutions.”","status",NA,NA,367,171,54,17,5,6,7,44

The ROD respects local input and leaves it up to Rhode Island to determine how to best address capacity and environmental concerns within the state.

He should take action and lead.  President Trump was late to respond to this crisis, but it is never too late to do the right thing.  America needs to step up when our fellow Americans are down.   “People are desperate – some have been without power, food, water, and medicine for days -- and our nation is capable of doing more to help.  The American people don’t want to hear insults from the President, they want to see positive results.”   Earlier this week, I called for a stepped-up response to the dire post-hurricane humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  I sent a letter to President Trump expressing deep concern about the situation in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and urging swift action by the federal government. Reed and his colleagues outlined eight specific actions the Trump administration should undertake, including:  ·       Calling on President Trump to issue a full Disaster Declaration for the entire island of Puerto Rico, which has yet to happen.  ·       Calling on President Trump to appoint a Special Assistant for Rebuilding, to coordinate the multi-faceted federal efforts for Puerto Rico across all departments and agencies. ·       Calling on President Trump to request more funding to assist Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program.  ·       Calling on President Trump to utilize all federal resources to restore power, including sending Department of Energy experts; 500 utility employees; 100 fuel trucks; and 200 generators.  ·       Calling on President Trump to send more Department of Defense assets: construction battalions to repair power and transportation infrastructure, command and control aircraft for air traffic control; helicopters for search and rescue; and 1,500 service members to provide disaster and humanitarian assistance. ·       Calling on President Trump to work with Congress to waive the local cost share requirement for FEMA public assistance disaster funding for all categories of FEMA public assistance. ·       Calling on President Trump to send assets and expertise from across the federal government to restore communications, including from Department of Commerce, FCC, Coast Guard, and DOD. ·       Calling on President Trump to ensure that FEMA, Coast Guard, and DOD work together effectively to restore all ports to working condition.","status",NA,NA,1311,410,332,110,8,10,19,83

Law enforcement is still investigating what happened and we’re waiting for more details.  But I think once again this tragic mass-shooting underscores the need to enact more responsible laws with respect to access to automatic weapons.    Too many families have suffered tragic losses as a result of gun deaths and injuries.  Gun violence is a public health burden that demands a national assessment of potential causes and preventative actions by the federal government to address this issue in a fact-driven, comprehensive way.  I supported the assault weapons ban that unfortunately lapsed during the Bush Administration, and since have supported attempts to revive it.  These are military weapons – some of which I used when I was a paratrooper.  They shouldn’t be as easy to access as they can be today.    We need more thorough background checks, and to close loopholes that help bad actors circumvent laws on the books. We can craft commonsense, responsible gun laws without compromising our Constitutional rights.    There is still much we do not know about last night’s attack, but it has again undermined our shared sense of security and irreparably harmed hundreds of American families.  Congress cannot continue to refuse to take action on rational and responsible gun control legislation.","status",NA,NA,480,189,51,25,1,2,68,11

The victims and the American people deserve justice, and the perpetrator must pay dearly for it.  And we are capable of bringing the attacker to justice here in the United States.  Federal courts have been far more efficient at prosecuting terrorism cases than the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay.

The Trump Administration’s plan to dismantle net neutrality will undermine the principles of a free and open internet and there’s every reason to think consumers will ultimately pay the price.    This repeal will benefit a few big companies at the expense of their customers who use the internet every day.  It means Internet Service Providers (ISPs) won’t have to treat all content equally, and that could lead to anti-competitive practices where companies can charge extra fees or slow down services if you don’t pay a premium.  The FCC’s actions come on the heels of its move to loosen rules designed to limit monopoly control of local broadcast properties.  Consumers should be aware that President Trump’s appointee, Chairman Ajit Pai, has introduced these changes.  The American people should speak up now or be prepared for new internet fees and restrictions down the road.  I urge people to tell their elected representatives and the FCC to support net neutrality.”    Rhode Islanders wishing to weigh in on the matter may call my office at 943-3100, or contact the FCC directly at: https://www.fcc.gov/about/contact","link","https://www.fcc.gov/about/contact","fcc.gov",107,103,153,4,4,3,19,177

Instead, Republican leaders rushed this slap-dashed, partisan, trickle-down tax scheme through with a reckless disregard for facts and independent analysis.  I oppose the Trump tax bill because it is unfair and irresponsible.  It is an historic transfer of wealth from students, seniors, and working families to multi-national corporations and wealthy estates.  It weakens America’s financial stability and undermines the integrity of our tax system, baking corporate tax avoidance into the system.  Republicans added so many new loopholes that some wealthy individuals with armies of tax lawyers may escape taxation altogether.  They also got rid of targeted tax deductions that middle-class Rhode Island families have relied upon.  The Trump tax will adversely affect Rhode Islanders in so many ways.  The temporary benefits some families may see won’t cover the long-term damage from this bill or offset the increased costs for things like child care, education, health care, and housing.  Republicans currently control the House, Senate, and White House and are using their leverage to run up the federal debt and cut holes in the social safety net.  They will soon demand cuts to Social Security and Medicare to reduce the deficit they just created.  Rhode Islanders pay into Social Security and Medicare with every paycheck they earn, and I will strongly oppose any effort to take away or lessen their retirement security.  Instead of simplifying the tax code, the Trump tax bill opens more loopholes than it closes.  Instead of prioritizing tax relief for the middle-class and small businesses, it lines the pockets of the powerful at the expense of working families.  There is not a single, respected economist or tax scholar on the left or right who contends that this bill simplifies the tax code and pays for itself.  Not one.  President Trump and Congressional Republicans sold the American people a bad bill of goods.  Now President Trump is trying to claim his short-term political victory is a win for everyday Americans, but they will see all the benefits going to his family and very few going to theirs.  I will continue working to prevent and undo the damage from this bill and enact real, responsible tax reform that boosts take home pay, spurs job growth, closes loopholes, expands opportunity, and strengthens the long-term financial stability and security of our nation.","status",NA,NA,382,133,69,2,6,2,37,82
