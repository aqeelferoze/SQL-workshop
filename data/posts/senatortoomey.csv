I am grateful for the support I received from across our state and humbled by the responsibilities of this office. We have many challenges to address and much work to do to improve the lives of all Americans.   We also have a tremendous opportunity before us. With the elections now in the rearview mirror, I hope Congress and the incoming president can focus on governing and working together on a variety of important issues.  First, Obamacare has been a disaster for many Pennsylvanians and it is only getting worse. Congress must repeal this failing law and replace it with a more sensible system that gives families and individuals affordable choices in coverage and takes Washington bureaucrats out of the doctor’s office.     Second, we need to reform our broken tax code to produce more investment, job creation, and economic prosperity here at home.  For too long the tax code has encouraged just the opposite as we watched businesses move overseas while special interests gamed the system.  Third, we should reduce the regulation coming out Washington including repealing most of Dodd-Frank and other regulations that are needlessly harming individuals and companies.  Fourth, I remain deeply concerned about the security of the American people. Around the world, we see more instability and hostile countries expanding their influence at our expense. The threat from violent Islamist extremists is growing.   At home, people are worried about crime in their communities. I am committed to supporting a more robust security agenda that will keep the American people safe.  With so many issues facing the 115th Congress, I anticipate that it will be a very busy one right out of the gates. So let’s get to work.","status",NA,NA,273,859,28,8,2,1,5,167

The heart of Obamacare — the individual health care market — is failing. Insurers are abandoning the market, premiums are skyrocketing, and people are losing the coverage they were promised they could keep.    Obamacare rests upon a flawed premise: that government must be in control of your health care. To help the limited number of individuals with the costliest preexisting conditions, Obamacare upended the entire system for everyone. This big government approach to health insurance didn’t work.  It resulted in higher premiums and deductibles, fewer choices in plans and doctors, and less hiring and economic growth. Pennsylvanians deserve a health care system that empowers families and individuals to access the care they need, at a price they can afford, from a doctor they choose.  With today’s action in the Senate, they are on their way to getting it.  I have said for many years we should move toward a system that gives Americans more affordable choices in coverage and takes Washington bureaucrats out of the doctor’s office. As Obamacare is repealed and we transition to a better health care system, we cannot pull the rug out from under anyone who is currently covered by Obamacare. This means federal taxpayer subsidies should be maintained for a period of time until an affordable, consumer-driven alternative is permitted.    There are a number of good ideas and timelines for a replacement structure, but all should aim to protect the American people from further damage inflicted by Obamacare. Today, I had a productive conversation about some of the ways we can work together to improve the health care system with Dr. Tom Price, a supremely qualified candidate to serve as the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. I am looking forward to Dr. Price’s confirmation hearing and working with the new administration on giving people choice and affordability in health care once again.","status",NA,NA,674,4757,373,36,9,5,183,2098

I support the administration's decision to increase vetting and temporarily suspend the admission of certain individuals from states that sponsor or provide safe havens to terrorists, or are too weak to prosecute terrorists within their borders.  Terrorists have successfully infiltrated refugee populations entering Europe and gone on to commit heinous acts of barbarity. I have long been concerned about our ability to distinguish between predominantly peaceful and innocent refugees, and the likely rare, but lethal, terrorists in the midst of those refugees coming from terror havens and lawless lands. That is why I, along with a bipartisan majority of the House and Senate, supported the SAFE Act, which called for enhanced vetting.   Unfortunately, the initial executive order was flawed – it was too broad and poorly explained.  This apparently resulted in denied entry into the United States for lawful permanent residents and others who should have been allowed immediate entry.  Fortunately, the administration has clarified that this order does not apply to Green Card holders and that the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security have the ability to grant exceptions which certainly should apply to, among others, foreign nationals who served the U.S. military in various support roles.    I look forward to learning more about how the administration intends to enforce this executive order, to determine whether it indeed strikes the appropriate balance between defending our nation and maintaining our ability to provide a safe haven for persecuted individuals.","status",NA,NA,1085,6108,360,85,6,6,79,2643

Crucially, Judge Gorsuch understands the proper role of a judge. He understands that his job is to apply the law and U.S. Constitution as written, not to pick winners and losers based on personal or partisan policy preferences. Judge Gorsuch’s record shows that he will treat everyone equally—regardless of race, sex, religion, sexual orientation, political views, influence, or wealth. And I believe that like Justice Scalia, Judge Gorsuch will be a principled justice, will be dedicated to the principles of originalism, and will neutrally apply the law, even when doing so leads to a policy outcome he personally opposes.   Judge Gorsuch’s record indicates that he has the character, intellect, and experience to make an excellent addition to the U.S. Supreme Court.   Judge Gorsuch has sterling credentials. He earned his undergraduate degree from Columbia University, his law degree from Harvard, and a PhD in Law from Oxford University. In 2006, the U.S. Senate confirmed Judge Gorsuch to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit without a single Democrat or Republican objecting.   I have long held that when considering judicial nominees, objective qualifications are more important than partisan politics, and Senators should work across the aisle to fill the federal bench with highly qualified jurists.   I have worked on a bipartisan basis with Senator Casey and the Obama White House to fill 16 vacancies on the federal bench in Pennsylvania. And, although I knew I would disagree with many of her decisions, I supported President Obama’s nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court.   I plan to apply the same standard of fairness to the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch. And I hope my fellow Senators will do the same. I hope they will review Judge Gorsuch’s record with an open mind. And I hope they will remember that the test is not whether we agree with every decision Judge Gorsuch has rendered, but whether Judge Gorsuch understands the proper role of a judge and has the character, intellect, and experience to merit confirmation.  I look forward to the Judiciary Committee’s hearing and meeting Judge Gorsuch in person.","status",NA,NA,1161,5779,132,120,15,4,47,1538

President Trump’s executive order does not set forth a religious test. It sets forth a national security test to protect the American people.   The executive order also specifies that any nation can remove itself from the list by sharing information on terrorists with the United States. In this way, today’s executive order is similar to the American SAFE Act, which I and a bipartisan majority of the House and Senate supported last Congress.  Furthermore, I was pleased to see that President Trump has taken into account concerns I raised about the previous order. For example, the new order wisely clarifies that green card holders and those who were granted visas for assisting our military will be able to enter the U.S.   While I am still reviewing the details of today’s executive order and will closely monitor its implementation, it appears to lay out a more detailed, coordinated, and clearer set of rules that will hopefully yield less confusion about who can and cannot enter the country.","status",NA,NA,440,1069,60,33,5,2,14,730
