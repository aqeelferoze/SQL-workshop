Given the extensive problems identified in the mishandling of the fraud determinations, including the 93% error of reviewed cases, oversight and thorough changes are long overdue.  I appreciate the comments by Ms. Stokes about UIA helping Michiganders through a difficult time in their lives and her commitment to making the agency stronger and more effective.

This shuts the door to Muslims fleeing violence and persecution.  “Our nation has served as a beacon for those in desperate situations, and with the President’s Executive Order, that light is much dimmer today. The total ban of Syrian refugees, who are fleeing deplorable conditions and caught between the Assad regime and ISIS, is neither an effective national security strategy, nor reflective of our character as a nation. The Administration’s action fails to acknowledge the rigorous and lengthy process which currently takes between 18-24 months, and involves multiple Federal intelligence, security, and law enforcement agencies. The safeguards include biometric (fingerprint) to confirm identity, multiple layers of biographical and background checks, medical screenings, and in-person interviews. At any time during the process, refugees cannot be resettled to the United States if U.S. security agencies cannot verify details, or if they cannot pass screenings. We can and must both fight terrorism and help those who seek to escape it.

I want to share a particularly compelling story, coming from Kate from Ann Arbor.   Kate writes: “In September 2012, at age 24, I left my full-time job at a local nonprofit with great benefits to pursue a masters degree in social work. Frankly, I wasn't too worried - I had always been in good health. But, thanks to the ACA, I was able to go back on my parents' insurance plan, and I started classes in September. I was feeling tired and run down, with a nagging cough, but at 24 it was easy to chalk that up to balancing school and work. That December, I noticed a bump on my collarbone and several swollen lymph nodes.  Despite being sure that it was nothing, my friend convinced me to make an appointment with my doctor.  “It was stage 3 Hodgkin's lymphoma - a blood cancer. In one appointment, my life turned upside down, and soon I was facing biopsies, blood tests, and treatment planning. In January 2013, I began six months of chemotherapy. That June, my scans showed a great response to treatment - but there was still active cancer, so I went on to a month of radiation therapy. In November, I learned that I was finally in remission.   “What stands out to me most is that while I worried a lot that year, and I still worry today - about recurrence, long-term side effects, and survivorship - what I never had to worry about, thanks to the ACA, was being denied treatment for lack of resources or insurance. I didn't have to worry about the long term implications of my ""pre-existing condition."" No person, cancer patient or otherwise, should ever have to fear that the scariest time in their life could be made even harder by leaders who do not value health care as a basic human right.”  You can share a story of how the #AffordableCareAct has impacted the lives of you and your family here: http://bit.ly/2kk6Sv8","link","http://bit.ly/2kk6Sv8","bit.ly",39,4,2,0,0,0,0,0

One of these benefits is maternal and newborn care. Jenny, from Huntington Woods, shared a story of how the access to these benefits helped her as a new mother.  Jenny writes:  ""I thought breastfeeding would be blissful bonding. I had a very hard time with my first baby. Luckily, I had insurance that covered visits to an exceptional lactation consultant. She put me on a strict schedule of feeding and pumping, made possible by the free breast pump given to me under the Affordable Care Act. I successfully nursed until I was ready to wean, and my second baby latched the moment he was born.

Here's what a bit of what I said earlier this evening when a Republican Member said that Democrats have ""anecdotes"" about the ACA:  Those who have benefited from ACA are not ""anecdotes."" The ACA isn't ""anecdotes."" It’s the lives of millions and millions who have benefited from ACA, many of whom went to be every night previously without ever having any insurance coverage whatsoever.   But to simply say we’re raising the anecdotes, if the millions of people who have benefited from ACA could come here and line up, the line would stretch for hundreds of miles.  There is nothing more sacred or important than one’s health care. Nothing. Nothing. And to minimize it, is to make, I think, a mortal mistake.

Confirming other analyses, the CBO report shows in a clear, shocking way the Republican plan jeopardizes for the American people insurance vital for their health, and often their lives.  Rushing to vote before the full consequences were understood, Republicans can’t hide any longer from the reality of their plan. It unmasks President Trump’s promise to provide insurance for everybody that will be much less expensive.

Following this study, the EPA proposed to revoke all use of chlorpyrifos on farms.

My involvement with community anti-drug coalitions goes back over 20 years now.  I saw then how a strong community presence and an active coalition can have a positive impact on students and their community.

There are little things that we can do every day to help reduce carbon pollution and make a less harmful impact on the environment.

I've never worked for an employer who has offered healthcare coverage, so until the ACA was passed, I never had healthcare coverage. Through the ACA I was able to purchase a silver plan through Total Health Care.  In December of 2015, the apartment building in which I lived had a fire. I was trapped inside of the burning apartment building. I jumped, and was taken by ambulance to Beaumont Hospital with an open fracture of the left ankle, a shattered heel bone, and a broken back. I had three surgeries and months of therapies, all covered by my ACA plan. In October of 2016 I had a 3rd and final surgery on my foot. At this point, I had been out of work for almost a year, and I was covered by a Healthy Michigan plan for the remainder of 2016. I am currently covered under the Medicaid expansion. Without this critical healthcare coverage, I would have been saddled with over $700,000 in medical bills. I would be bankrupt.

To try to save his life, it was necessary to start aggressive treatment immediately.  Alex had just recently graduated from Eastern Michigan University and had not yet secured a job with health benefits. Fortunately, because of the Affordable Care Act, we were able to maintain Alex on the health plan my wife. If it wasn’t for the ACA, Alex could not have stayed on her policy and he could not have afforded to secure his own health coverage.  After a series of treatments, Alex received his “no evidence of cancer” news in October 2015. Since that time, he has needed regular testing to confirm that the cancer has not come back and he has been hospitalized twice for intestinal bowel blockages related to the impact of the chemotherapy treatments.  To date, his medical costs are approaching $400,000 over the last year and a half…and he is only 24 years old. Up to now, except for approximately $175 of co-pays and the approximately $600 per month that my wife must contribute toward her healthcare insurance, all of these charges have been covered by our health insurance.

Because I was carrying a high-deductible, catastrophic coverage only type policy, I had been putting off taking care of an increasingly painful problem with my back that finally landed me in the hospital in October 2011 for emergency surgery. By then, thankfully, I had an established ACA policy through Humana, and while there was still a $5,000 deductible to pay, it was much more do-able than it would have been before the ACA. I would have simply been disabled and unable to continue teaching if I didn’t have that surgery.   Since that time I have transitioned over to Medicare, but my sons and their families are now very vulnerable to any repeal or replace actions the GOP might pursue.

Because of that we have coverage under the health plan they offer to retirees, Tricare Prime. It is an excellent program with low premiums for both of us. However, my daughter lost this coverage when she turned 21. The reason is that Tricare is an ""entitlement program.” It is not ""health insurance"", so she could not be covered until the age of 26 like all other parents can do under the ACA guidelines. She has a pre-existing health condition, as well as being a woman. I signed her up for an ACA plan through the marketplace. The premiums aren't that high (about $300 a month)...that is less than I paid when I had healthcare through my employer for a much lower coverage plan. If the protections afforded by the ACA (no lifetime limits, no exclusion of pre-existing conditions) are removed, she will have to find insurance as a single person. She has no full time job and is attending school for a career she has not decided on yet. We are fortunate that she has no serious conditions such as diabetes or cancer. But what if she did get those? What would we do? My husband and I will be retiring in about 4 years from our jobs. We will then be on Medicare so we have our own concerns with that.

Programs created by the Social Security Act have done just that for these 82 years.   But President Trump has requested $72 billion in cuts to Social Security programs that assist Americans with disabilities and families struggling with poverty. It is now the responsibility of Congress to reject these senseless cuts. I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to keep this classic FDR quote in mind as they draft the Fiscal Year 2018 budget: ""The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have little.""","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSandyLevin/photos/a.227961447230068.76883.223726364320243/2108353135857547/?type=3",NA,97,22,25,9,0,4,1,1

For that reason, the Ryan White CARE Act bears his name.

While the GOP bill gives the very wealthy enormous tax breaks, it actually raises taxes on tens of millions of middle-class families by eliminating the personal exemption and deductions for medical expenses, for full state and local taxes, and for educational needs. Speaker Ryan has said the bill is focused on the middle class, but that is simply not true. It’s really the opposite: it’s a bill built for millionaires. And the process used to consider it has been driven by desperation, rather than deliberation.   The more the American people learn about the Republican tax bill, the more they will reject it, just as every Democrat did today on the Committee on Ways and Means.
