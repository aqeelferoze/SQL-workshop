However, ultimately Republicans plan an aggressive agenda that will attempt to implement their ultra conservative agenda. I will work with the other Delegates to try and address any of our legacy issues should comprehensive tax reform occur or should there be an effort at immigration reform.

I agree that Republicans and the Trump Administration have not demonstrated any willingness or initiative to address the unique challenges of our island. Since the beginning of last year, I have been working diligently with DOD to stress to USCIS the importance of the H-2B program to having an adequate workforce on Guam, and we are working to provide legislative relief in this year’s defense bill. We successfully included this legislation in last year’s bill but it was stripped out by the Republican-led Senate. While the Trump Administration lacks a clear domestic strategy, I have been and continue to work on a broader permanent solution that will address Guam’s unique workforce challenges.  I continue to believe that the buildup will be good for Guam and provide us with opportunities to expand and grow our community—through additional job creation as well as new specialized industries in areas like telecommunications and cyber security. It’s also critical for the continued security of our region, especially in light of growing threats from North Korea. We have invested heavily in supporting this buildup and while there have been challenges along the way, we continue to make progress to ensure that it is good for Guam and our people. Turning back now may jeopardize this progress, which includes significant civilian infrastructure investments and will settle outstanding land use challenges, such as the net-negative commitment which reduces the military footprint on our island.  I hope Governor Calvo is sincere when he says that he wants the buildup to happen, but that the H-2B challenges have forced his hand. I will continue to work with him and our stakeholders to push for an H-2B solution as well as advocate for a military buildup that addresses our community’s concerns and provides opportunities that are good for our people. We have had and will continue to have our challenges, but by working together, we will overcome them.","link","https://bordallo.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/bordallo-statement-governor-calvo-no-longer-supporting-buildup","bordallo.house.gov",9,3,6,0,0,0,0,0

While we have heard threats like this in the past, I take them very seriously and continue to engage with our DOD partners to ensure that Guam and our people remain safe. Similar threats back in 2013 led me to advocate with then-Defense Secretaries Panetta and Hagel to deploy a THAAD battery to Guam, which I worked to permanently station on island. I have also discussed these threats with Secretary Mattis, PACOM Commander Admiral Harris, and other senior leaders in the Pentagon, and they have consistently reassured me that Guam is protected.  However these recent threats make it imperative for President Trump to work with the international community, especially with China and other stakeholders in the region, to de-escalate these tensions. The President’s tweet earlier today is concerning and unhelpful and does not lay out a clear strategy on how he will address the growing threats from North Korea. Kim Jong-Un’s reckless behavior cannot be tolerated, and I strongly urge the President to explore every avenue to peacefully respond to it and avoid further escalating this situation.","link","https://bordallo.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/bordallo-s-statement-north-korea-s-threat-guam","bordallo.house.gov",63,8,15,2,0,0,0,2

Guam is not a bargaining chip. Guam is a U.S. territory with more than 160,000 American citizens living on island, and he is responsible for preventing any acts of aggression towards our community.

DACA has allowed 800,000 young people--including some of our neighbors and friends on Guam--to learn and work in our communities and for many, the United States of America is the only country they have ever known. While President Trump’s reversal of DACA affects our nation, his decision impacts residents on Guam as well.  For example, Christine, a 22 year old DREAMer who arrived on Guam as a child, has benefited from the DACA program and has made Guam her home. Despite the circumstances dealt her way, she latched onto the American dream and is now a vital part of our society working as a Registered Nurse – giving back to our society. Our island community has had a strong history of supporting immigrants and those who come to our country and island for a better life. While there is work to be done to improve our immigration system, rescinding DACA does not strengthen efforts to keep America safe or level the playing field; all it accomplishes is creating a level of uncertainty for these DREAMers who contribute positively to our nation.

I continue to work to keep the DOD accountable to the promises it has made to ensure the build-up would be good for Guam’s civilian community while supporting our nation's military efforts. Last week I wrote to Defense Secretary Mattis requesting that he recommit to the DOD’s ‘Four Pillars’ and the requirements of the 2011 Programmatic Agreement and 2017 biological opinion, as well as provide a detailed response to questions on DOD’s efforts to support our indigenous Chamorro history, culture, and natural resources. I believe that transparency is key, and DOD must be more engaged with our community and provide information to the public as this program moves forward.  Renewed calls by our local community regarding proposed plans for the buildup have not gone unheard, and we must continue to work towards goals that are good for Guam and our region.

However Congress has still not repealed sequestration, and in doing so we deny DoD the budget stability it needs to support the training, maintenance, and modernization needs of our forces.   The bill makes progress to help alleviate Guam’s H-2B visa crisis by providing USCIS with flexibility to approve H-2B visas for Guam construction projects directly related to, or associated with, the military buildup. While this is not the full solution I introduced in the House bill, it is a step in the right direction and overcomes strong opposition by the Senate and the Trump Administration to providing relief for non-DoD construction projects. Our provisions is clear that these H-2B visas should be approved not only for military construction, but also for civilian infrastructure projects outside the gate funded by the federal government, the Government of Guam, or non-governmental entities that are being done, in part, because of increased military personnel and their families on Guam.  As we move forward, I look forward to working with our local leaders and partners to overcome the objections that were expressed by the Senate and Administration and provide for full relief for our health care and other industries. I also support Governor Calvo’s efforts and hope he is successful in getting the Trump Administration to administratively reverse USCIS’s H-2B visa denials.
