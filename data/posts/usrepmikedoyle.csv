The amended Trumpcare bill wouldn’t address any of the other problems with the Republican “American Health Care Act” that we fought against last month. It would still gut Medicaid by over $800 billion, and it would still take health care away from 24 million Americans.

It’s not much different that the American Health Care Act passed by House Republicans last month.   CBO estimates that more than 22 million Americans would lose health care coverage under this bill - but this bill would affect ALL Americans – not just those on Medicaid and in the ACA health insurance exchanges. Millions of others would end up paying more for insurance that covers less.    Once again, we could all be at the mercy of insurance companies and their abusive practices that the Affordable Care Act prohibited – like annual and lifetime benefit caps and discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions.   Once again, Americans could go broke paying for things like mental health care, maternity care, and prescription drugs.   It’s obvious that this bill was drafted with the goal of cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy, not improving health care for most Americans. Senator McConnell ought to throw this bill in the trash and start over – this time with an open and transparent bipartisan process and the goal of improving and strengthening the existing Affordable Care Act.

I have been strong advocate for a free and open Internet and I have long fought to put in place rules to protect consumers and small businesses.  These rules are essential to protecting the Internet and the enormous engine of growth and opportunity it has become.   More than that, the Internet has become the medium through which we communicate with friends, family, and express ourselves as individuals and citizens of this country.  Net Neutrality is more than an economic issue, it is an issue of our freedom to communicate and express ourselves and our rights under the law to do so.  Many have said that this is the First Amendment right of the 21st Century, and I agree.   An Open Internet is essential to fostering innovation, promoting public discourse, protecting small businesses, and preserving consumers’ ability to access online content.  The current Net Neutrality rules protect and preserve the Open Internet as a platform for competition, innovation, and free speech. They allow the growth of new and improved internet services and applications that would never get off the ground without a level playing field. These strong, enforceable rules, which have stood up to court challenge, prohibit the blocking or throttling of online content – and they prevent carriers from establishing fast lanes or paid prioritization.  The American People have spoken out loud and clear in support of Net Neutrality - more than 6.5 million people have filed comments with the FCC so far this year. They support the current Net Neutrality rules, which protect consumers, small businesses, and edge providers looking to provide innovative and competitive new services. They deserve to have their views respected by the federal government. The current Net Neutrality rules preserve a free and open internet, which promotes innovation, competition, greater economic growth, and free speech while protecting consumers and small businesses. I believe the FCC should listen to the millions of Americans who’ve filed comments urging the Commission to preserve its current Open Internet rules.","status",NA,NA,221,17,34,13,0,0,0,0

Under law, the President is required to provide Congress with evidence that Iran is non-compliant. No such evidence has been provided to Congress to-date.    This decision by the President goes against the advice of experts around the world and within his own Cabinet, and is intended only to fulfill an unwise campaign promise; this should not be the way that our foreign affairs are conducted.    By declaring that Iran is no longer in compliance, Congress now has 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions that were suspended under the deal. I hope that Congress will act wisely, and not re-impose sanctions without cause.    Regardless, I am concerned that today’s decision will have grave effects beyond sanctions. Our allies around the world have shown no signs of ending the agreement, making any attempt to ‘tear up the deal’ or impose sanctions meaningless. By walking away from this agreement, President Trump may once again reduce America’s credibility with our allies, embolden Iran, hurt America’s economy, and threaten our national security.

The Commission also dumped a risky new broadcast TV standard on the American people.

Making sure they have a home should be one of the ways we demonstrate our appreciation for their service.   The Trump Administration’s decision to cut a critical $460 million program which helps homeless vets is disgraceful. On December 1, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced its decision to cut $265 million from this program immediately and to divert $195 million more under the 2018 budget. While it claims it will redistribute these funds to VA facilities across the country that deal with homelessness, there's no requirement  that they use the money to help homeless vets. I’d rather see the money stay in the program that’s focused on homeless veterans.   While we have made progress in housing our veterans, there are still 40,000 homeless veterans today who need help. We should build on the progress we’ve made and continue to fulfill our obligation to do right by these honorable Americans.

Under the GOP tax bill, more than 80 percent of the cuts will go to households making more than $5 million a year. That’s no Middle Class tax cut.  But there are many other reasons behind my vote against this misguided bill: •it will actually raise taxes on most Middle Class households after a few short years, with more than half of all taxpayers - 86 million households - paying more; •it won’t raise wages;  •it gives a new tax break to corporations for shipping US jobs overseas;  •it will cause a $25 billion cut in Medicare next year; and •it will cause federal budget deficits to explode, increasing the national debt by more than $1.5 trillion.   Enactment of the Republican tax bill will leave most households worse off in the long run. Their tax cuts will be replaced with tax increases, and Republicans plan to use the increased national debt as justification to cut programs like Medicare and Medicaid that most Americans rely on.   Moreover, rather than providing the greatest tax relief to families who need it the most – who will pump that money right back into the economy – the GOP tax bill provides the lion’s share of its tax cuts to corporations and the households that are the most well off.   This tax bill is a scam perpetrated on the American People by Republicans in Congress and the White House. When the American People discover what this bill really does, they will hold those who are responsible for it accountable.  I will continue to work in Congress to curb these unsustainable giveaways to corporations and the rich – and to redirect federal resources to the millions of families who are struggling to get by. They’re the ones who need and deserve tax relief and adequately funded federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid.","status",NA,NA,568,170,82,61,2,1,2,30
