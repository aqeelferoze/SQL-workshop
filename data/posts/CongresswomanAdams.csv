This move eliminates independent oversight of congressional actions and prevents the office from reviewing anonymous complaints.   This action goes against the transparency that the American people expect and deserve from their elected officials. Congress must hold itself to the highest standards of conduct and should act accordingly to strengthen our own ethical standards.   http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/house-republicans-gut-their-own-oversight-233111","link","http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/house-republicans-gut-their-own-oversight-233111","politico.com",26,10,29,1,0,7,3,26

This bill is a solution to a problem that does not exist and undermines critical protections for students, workers, taxpayers and consumers.  As my colleague, Congressman Hank Johnson, stated in November, 2016 about the Midnight Rules Relief Act it ""...would amend the Congressional Review Act to enable Congress to bundle numerous rules finalized during the final year of a president’s term into a single vote on a joint resolution of disapproval.  Alarmingly, once these rules have been invalidated through this process, the agency may not adopt a subsequent similar rule absent express authorization by Congress.  Notwithstanding the bill’s colorful title, the bill does not simply apply to rules submitted during the lame-duck period following an election.  To set the record straight, this bill applies to every rule submitted to Congress within the final 60 legislative days of a session.

His first decisions as President have been divisive: codifying religious and racial bigotry, threatening American relationships with the international community, and betraying the values of our nation as they’re written in the Constitution.   In just one week as President, he has jeopardized health insurance for tens of millions of Americans, promoted policies that will waste billions of taxpayer dollars, assaulted woman’s healthcare, and attacked immigrants. He has also suspended the refugee program and stranded thousands of people in war zones, instituted a hiring freeze, shown a blatant disregard for our environment, silenced federal agencies, and urged the return of torture tactics.  To make matters worse, instead of healing the political divide felt by our nation, President Trump is more content to fan his ego by perpetuating falsehoods about voter fraud and the crowd size during his inauguration.

Our schools need a real commitment and investment from this administration.   Despite the buildup, this Executive Order doesn’t include details about federal agency funding, grants, or contracts. This action on HBCUs is not sufficient to hold up to promises made by this administration. Our schools need substantial policy changes and increased funding to create a real impact on their campuses-not just a photo op in the Oval office.   As we establish national priorities through the budget, we must protect public education, bolster and expand Pell Grants, and give schools and students the means to be successful.

Now, President Trump is calling for a $54 billion increase in defense spending at the expense of domestic programs that fund public education and protect our environment.   During his address this evening, I hope the American people will learn where the President’s priorities truly lie. Americans want increased investments in public education and infrastructure, government transparency, to keep their affordable healthcare, greater economic opportunities, and comprehensive immigration reform. Will the President’s priorities align?  I look forward to hearing President Trump’s vision for the future of our nation.

This evening’s speech offered nothing new. There was no mention of a replacement plan for the healthcare he would like to revoke from 20 million people or details about how he’ll provide greater economic opportunities for all Americans.   If President Trump is serious about investing in America, I expect his budget proposal to Congress to reflect it. Americans want economic security, quality public education, affordable healthcare, clean air, and comprehensive immigration reform.

TrumpCare will not strengthen our Healthcare system.  Instead, it will raise premiums for seniors and working families by an average of 25-29% during the first two years. TrumpCare also guts essential health benefits, such as preventative, prenatal, and mental health care, and coverage for preexisting conditions like asthma, diabetes, and pregnancy.   The GOP championed an $8 billion dollar fund to establish high risk pools for Americans with preexisting conditions but they failed to explain that the funding will be distributed over five years and across the nation, likely only helping 76,000 Americans. This is not an adequate solution; millions of Americans with preexisting conditions will be priced out of their insurance coverage all together. This is a dangerous bill that, not only makes America sick again, but gives a $600 billion dollar tax break to big corporations and the rich.   Today, my Republican colleagues shamefully put partisan politics before the American people. But the fight for our healthcare is far from over. TrumpCare now moves to the Senate and I urge North Carolinians to contact our Senators and demand a ‘no’ vote.","status",NA,NA,217,64,117,4,1,2,72,110

His statement stands in stark contrast to his original commitment to our HBCUs, and the Executive Order he signed in keeping with that commitment. Any action taken to weaken the HBCU Capital Financing Program would undermine their financial stability, harming both students and alumni alike.   The Capital Financing Program provides needed infrastructure funding for our HBCUs that suffer from a dearth of resources from both the public and private sectors. Rather than singling it out, we need to come together as Democrats and Republicans to enhance the program’s effectiveness, ensuring that HBCUs are able to continue accessing low cost financing for their campuses. I introduced the bipartisan HBCU Capital Financing Improvement Act, with my colleague Representative Bradley Byrne, to boost these institutions' ability to do just that.   The President needs to keep his word and prioritize supporting these important institutions. The economic prospects of hundreds of thousands of Americans depends on it.    http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/05/trump-historically-black-colleges-financing-unconstitutional-238061","link","http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/05/trump-historically-black-colleges-financing-unconstitutional-238061","politico.com",44,20,39,0,0,1,13,67

It’s the most conservative we’ve ever seen and it’s not reflective of our nation’s growing needs.   It discards crucial investments in our community by eliminating TIGER grants, which are critical to fulfilling the 2030 Mecklenburg County Transit System plan, and does away with the Community Development Block Grant, used to fund vital programs that help local governments provide affordable housing and spur economic development.    In Mecklenburg County we have a serious upward mobility issue. This budget would make it harder to overcome by abolishing workforce development programs that close the skills gap, slashing our nation’s commitment to public pre-k with a $9 billion dollar cut, and decimating student financial aid by cutting $143 billion making college less affordable for the nearly 100,000 students in Mecklenburg County.   To make matters worse, this proposal puts our children and seniors at risk by stealing $610 billion from Medicaid, jeopardizing access to healthcare for the nearly 2 million North Carolinians enrolled in the program, and cuts $191 billion from SNAP, leaving CMS students and families to go hungry.  This budget is a statement of priorities and President Trump has made his clear: corporations will benefit while hardworking American families are left to fend for themselves.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/05/23/trump-proposes-dramatic-changes-to-federal-government-slashing-safety-net-programs-that-affect-up-to-a-fifth-of-americans/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-low_budget-1120am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.b2262f71883b","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/05/23/trump-proposes-dramatic-changes-to-federal-government-slashing-safety-net-programs-that-affect-up-to-a-fifth-of-americans/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-low_budget-1120am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.b2262f71883b","washingtonpost.com",15,21,13,0,0,1,7,33

Today, Blue Cross Blue Shield, North Carolina's only insurer in the ACA Marketplace, announced that they will need to increase premiums by an average of 22.9% in 2018.   ""The biggest single reason for the sharp increase in rates is the lack of federal funding for 'cost-sharing reductions' beginning in 2018,"" the company said. ""If the federal funding continued, we would have filed an average increase of just 8.8 percent for 2018.""  The ACA off sets costs for hardworking American families and helps ensure that people are getting the health coverage they need. Trumpcare, or as I call it 'Trump Don't Care' is threatening access to coverage for the half a million North Carolinians who depend on the marketplace for their insurance.   ""In other words, with the right actions coming out of Washington to stabilize the market, the rate increase from Blue Cross NC would have been between 5 percent and 6 percent.

The only explanation for this secretive behavior is that the bill must be so egregious that the Senate GOP feels they can't show it to their constituencies.   http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/338633-mccain-no-american-has-seen-healthcare-bill-but-im-sure-russia-has?rnd=1497987409","link","http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/338633-mccain-no-american-has-seen-healthcare-bill-but-im-sure-russia-has?rnd=1497987409","thehill.com",69,32,59,2,8,17,7,25

But those Essential Health Benefits aren't just on the line for Medicaid enrollees; it's possible that all women in the individual market could lose those protections. The bill allows states broad waiver authority in what services are covered by insurance plans, which experts told MONEY will allow them to redefine the Essential Health Benefits.

A reporter asked her if that assessment was 'too harsh.'  “Well, that’s reality,' responded Adams, 71. “I take medication every day, because I don’t have a thyroid anymore. I have to have that … and people have conditions that are much, much worse than mine. But yes, they do need that medication to survive.”  A minute later, she answered a question nobody had asked.

'If there is no longer a requirement for everyone to purchase coverage, it is critical that any legislation include strong incentives for people to obtain health insurance and keep it year-round. A system that allows people to purchase coverage only when they need it drives up costs for everyone. Immediate funding for the cost-sharing reduction program also is essential to help those individuals most in need with their out-of-pocket costs, so they can access medical services. And dedicated funds must be provided to help pay for the care of those with significant medical conditions.  In order to ensure a stable individual insurance marketplace, any final legislation must include these crucial elements to avoid steep premium increases and diminished choices that would make coverage unaffordable and inaccessible.'  The association appeared to be worried about a so-called “skinny repeal” bill that would do away with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate and mandate that most employers offer insurance to their workers, but would include little else. Republican leaders believe that such a narrow bill may be the only measure that can get through the Senate.""  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/health-care-senate-vote.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=a-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/health-care-senate-vote.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=a-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news","nytimes.com",21,6,18,0,0,0,0,3

Passage of the amendment allocates $40 million to the Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) program within the Department of Defense (DoD), a 54% increase over the President’s FY18 proposed authorized level and $7 million above current levels. Often the target of sequestration and budget cuts, the program received its highest funding level since 2010.  This week, Congresswoman Adams will lead a letter with Reps. Anthony Brown (MD-04) and Hank Johnson (GA-04) to Senate appropriators to ensure that this funding is included in their appropriations package.   Bipartisan HBCU Caucus members Reps. Adams and Brown stated:  “Passage of this amendment means that funding for this important program for our students of color will be at its highest level since 2010.

Congress is the only alternative to come out and say we repudiate the President, and, not only do we repudiate him, this does not speak for the United States; this is morally repugnant to us.”  http://www.newyorker.com/news/ryan-lizza/why-congress-should-censure-trump-for-boosting-white-supremacists","link","http://www.newyorker.com/news/ryan-lizza/why-congress-should-censure-trump-for-boosting-white-supremacists","newyorker.com",199,38,13,35,4,0,2,1

Earlier this month, my colleagues and I asked the administration for an update on their progress regarding HBCUs. In February, the President signed an executive order outlining greater investments and additional resources for HBCUs. It has become painstakingly clear that these promises are not being kept. In this current environment, and with zero progress made on any of their priorities, it would be highly unproductive to ask HBCU Presidents to come back to Washington. I call on the President and Secretary DeVos to postpone this year’s conference until a serious effort has been made to advance issues important to HBCUs and their students.","status",NA,NA,78,19,20,4,0,3,27,13

'We cannot continue to make promises we cannot keep. It's time for substantive action.'  For Adams, who graduated from North Carolina A&T State University in 1968, and then taught art history for 40 years at Bennett College, both of which are HBCUs, the issue is personal.  'I would not be here today if it were not for an HBCU who took a poor black girl from the ghetto of Newark, New Jersey, and molded me and nurtured me,' she said. 'I've dedicated my legislative career to advocating for you and your students. We want to you know that House Democrats hear you.'  That was positive news for the HBCU presidents, all of whom who are struggling with ways to increase their visibility and stress to the public just how important their institutions are, not only to students of color, but the country as a whole.

It's a time to remember those we lost, show our support for those fighting the disease, and recommit to eradicating breast cancer.   Breast cancer research and detection have come a long way and the prognosis has improved for many patients when the disease is detected early. But every two minutes, a woman is diagnosed with the disease and it’s still the most common form of cancer for women of all races and ethnicities.   We must make sure we are getting the preventative care and regular assessments when we can to ensure early detection. In Mecklenburg County, uninsured women can qualify for a free mammogram during the month of October at the C.W. Williams Health Center and the Mecklenburg County Health Department.   While breast cancer continues to plague our communities, with the right investments, research, preventative care, diagnosis, and treatment we can better combat this disease.","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanAdams/videos/1641421732555931/",NA,20,6,1,0,0,0,1,0

The amendments include:  1. Reinstating the tax exempt status of private use bonds, used to build infrastructure and affordable housing;  2. Reinstating the student loan interest tax deduction, making higher education more affordable; 3. Repealing the tax on tuition waivers and student stipends, protecting student’s access to higher education; 4. Instating a provision that makes HBCU Tax Bonds exempt from federal, state, and local taxes, incentivizing investment in HBCU bonds and increasing access to capital at HBCUs; 5. Incentivizing the hiring of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduates from minority serving institutions (MSI), creating pathways to opportunity for underserved communities;  6. Instating the Veterans Small Business Tax Credit, assisting veterans in becoming small business owners;  7. Repealing the tax on discharged student loans, releasing students from crushing student loan debt;  8.

Each year, more than 500 young adults age out of foster care without a permanent home which increases their chance of homelessness, unemployment, and incarceration. Johnson C.

The PROSPER Act presents an opportunity to remedy that by fully and equitably funding these institutions but unfortunately, this bill does nothing to create opportunities for students at MSIs or HBCUs to prosper. Instead, it denies resources to the neediest schools based on a flawed metric,” said Congresswoman Adams. “MSIs serve a unique student population comprised of minority, non-traditional, and first generation college students. Instead of stripping them of much-needed resources, we should be investing in the students they serve to give them the best chance possible to complete their education.”    http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article189427944.html","link","http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article189427944.html","mcclatchydc.com",8,5,4,0,0,1,0,2
