The most recent evidence of the UN’s bias against Israel came on December 23 in the form of Security Council Resolution 2334, which effectively states that the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem and the Western Wall – Judaism’s holiest site – are “occupied territory.” Sadly, the Obama Administration abstained from the December 23 UN vote, and the President subsequently refused to exercise his ability to veto the misguided resolution. Today in the U.S. House, however, we have reasserted the American people’s commitment to our friendship with Israel as we passed H. Res. 11 to call for full repeal of UN Resolution 2334. I regret that the action is needed at all, but am proud to support H. Res. 11 and all those standing with Israel.","status",NA,NA,45,19,8,1,0,0,0,0

President Trump was all-in, and I was all-in, but we simply couldn’t find enough votes in the House to pass it.    I believed—and still believe—that this bill represented America’s best opportunity to: (1) save the individual health care market from the destructive death spiral in which it is trapped with Obamacare, (2) escape one-size-fits-all federal solutions and provide complete flexibility to Georgia and other states to craft a Medicaid safety net program that can make an even more powerful difference for its citizens in crisis, and (3) repeal as many of the economically damaging and innovation-draining Obamacare taxes, penalties, and mandates as possible through the “reconciliation process.”  To read more on this process and sign up for my weekly newsletter, please follow the link below.","link","https://woodall.house.gov/media-center/e-newsletter-archive/washington-watch-32717","oodall.house.gov",21,123,11,2,9,0,1,16

Last night, I presided over the House as we passed two measures to do just that.  H.R. 479, the “North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act,” requires the State Department to submit a report to Congress determining if the North Korean government meets the criteria of a state sponsor of terrorism, and H.Res. 92 formally condemns North Korea’s development of intercontinental ballistic missiles.

However, the White House is on board with its principles of simplicity, fairness, and the elimination of damaging taxes such as the Death Tax and business-crushing Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) – all of which are present in the proposal released today.

The concern surrounding this panel of 15 unelected bureaucrats is that the legislation gave them power to unilaterally slash Medicare funds – and consequently seniors’ access to timely medical care.  This dangerous reality, and ill-conceived approach, has hung over the heads of Medicare beneficiaries for too long, and I was proud to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in voting to eliminate it.","status",NA,NA,84,57,17,11,1,1,2,13

Additionally, in recent days, we in the House passed two more bills to crack down on the Iranian regime’s financing of terrorism (H.R. 1638 and 4324).  The “Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act” (H.R. 1638), and the “Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act” (H.R. 4324) are both targeted measures to enhance the Treasury Department’s reporting requirements to Congress and the American people, thereby limiting Iran’s access to financial resources used to carry out acts of terror.","status",NA,NA,43,47,4,2,0,0,0,12
