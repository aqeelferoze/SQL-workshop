I am lucky enough to have called that man my dad. Dad was very proud of all the work the U.S. Air Force and X-plane program accomplished at Edwards Air Force Base. Yes, it's true it has been fifty years and the absolute air speed record in a manned aircraft is still 4,520 mph, but the resolve of the American people is burning bright and our thirst for new records and new challenges has to be quenched. I am so proud of my father and his achievements, but I am most proud of his willingness to take a risk and try to push and understand that the sky is no limit.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepresentativeSteveKnight/photos/a.555234661246050.1073741828.551782668257916/1069859433116901/?type=3",NA,382,55,51,46,0,13,0,0

Tragically, victims are commonly charged with crimes such as conspiracy, money laundering, drug trafficking, tax and immigration violations, prostitution, and related offenses that follow them throughout the duration of their lives. This bipartisan legislation would allow victims of human trafficking to petition courts to vacate convictions and expunge arrest records for offenses that they were forced to commit as victims of trafficking. The bill does not cover violent crimes or offenses of which minors were victims, and it gives courts discretion to decide whether convictions should be vacated.

I believe that our nation’s families deserve a healthcare system that is affordable and sustainable, not just for the next five years, but for generations to come.  The reality is that the Affordable Care Act is failing across the country by making care more expensive and in many places, severely limiting choices.  It’s not just failing in other states, it will eventually fail in California too. Action is required right now to replace its most damaging aspects before many families have no choices at all.  I am pleased that the House adopted an amendment I authored that would ensure that individuals with pre-existing conditions are protected in every situation for every family, in every state, especially California.  I have strongly advocated for and promised this throughout the entire discussion. This is a good first step, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to offer solutions that will address the problems faced by our current system and allow Americans access to the care they need.","status",NA,NA,262,1287,123,30,4,2,11,795
