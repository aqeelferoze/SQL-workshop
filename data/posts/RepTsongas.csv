Although the GOP Leaders heard the extensive public outcry and reversed course on some of their proposed changes, even discussing these actions signal a dangerous trend for the 115th Congress.

As a result of my legislation, the CFPB found that consumers were in fact receiving different credit scores than lenders.  Building on this investigation, the CFPB announced last week that Equifax and Transunion were guilty of deceiving consumers and violating the protections I fought to include in Dodd-Frank.  The CFPB is requiring the two credit bureaus to give $17.6 million back to consumers who were harmed. These companies misled consumers about the value of the credit scores they sold: In their advertising, TransUnion and Equifax falsely represented that the credit scores they marketed and provided to consumers were the same scores lenders typically use to make credit decisions. In fact, the scores sold by TransUnion and Equifax were not typically used by lenders to make those decisions. This is a win for consumers and will level the playing field for anyone trying to make decisions about the amount of credit they can access and the interest rate they receive on their mortgages, car loans, college loans, etc. I am also a cosponsor of the Fair Access to Credit Scores Act, introduced earlier today, to provide consumers with an annual free credit score that is reliable and used by lenders. http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-transunion-and-equifax-pay-deceiving-consumers-marketing-credit-scores-and-credit-products/","status",NA,NA,149,21,9,10,0,0,0,0

It is a time to show that when women succeed, we all succeed. History shows us that when women assume positions of leadership, they are able to draw more attention to issues that affect women and families as a whole. They blaze paths, serve as role models and inspire the next generation to get involved and stay engaged.  When I was elected in 2007, I was the first woman to join the Massachusetts Congressional delegation in 25 years. Today, I am proud to be joined by Senator Warren and Congresswoman Clark as part of 109 women in Congress. I am also proud to be a member of Women’s Caucus, working to ensure that the issues that impact women are addressed. As we celebrate the victories that women have won, we must also keep making progress.  This month and beyond, I look forward to celebrating the many contributions of women in our society, and to continue working on issues impacting women and families such as equal pay for equal work, paid family leave, access to safe and affordable health care and much more. As we celebrate the achievements and victories of women before us, we must also focus on what we can do to ensure that the next generation of women has those same opportunities, and more.

FACT: The 906-page Affordable Care Act was passed by both houses of Congress, including a 60-vote majority in the Senate, and signed by the President after more than a year of debate, consideration by five separate House and Senate committees, a record 25 straight days on the Senate floor, and the inclusion of hundreds of amendments from both sides of the aisle. But don't take my word for it. Speaking on the Senate floor in September about just the Senate side of the debate, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) noted: ""it's a matter of record that the Senate, to start with, the Senate Finance Committee considered the Affordable Care Act over several weeks and approved the bill October 13 of 2009. At that time, members of the Finance Committee submitted 564 amendments, 135 amendments were considered, 79 roll call votes taken, 41 amendments were adopted. Then the Senate Health, Education, Labor, Pensions Committee approved the Affordable Care Act by 13-10 after a month long debate, 500 amendments were considered, more than 160 Republican amendments were accepted. ""And then it came to the floor of the Senate. And the Affordable Care Act was on the floor for 25 straight days, including weekends. Between Thanksgiving and Christmas of 2009, 506 amendments were filed, 228 of which were Republican, 34 roll call votes were held... But the fact is, the fact is, that this legislation was hard fought, it was a legislative process. I didn't like the end of it but I'm proud of the effort that we made and frankly, the other side of the aisle allowed that debate to take place.""","status",NA,NA,95,13,31,1,0,1,0,0

Today’s Women’s History Month 3D Thursday spotlight is on the women of the Bread & Roses Strike. In 1912, the Massachusetts legislature passed a law reducing the workweek for women and children from 56 hours a week to 54. Women working in the Lawrence mills celebrated this progress – until mill owners cut their wages in proportion to the decreased hours. Already angry about the dangerous and appalling working conditions they were subjected to, the undermining of this new law propelled nearly 30,000 textile workers to walk off their jobs and to the streets to strike. Despite brutal opposition from mill owners and law enforcement in an attempt to dissuade the workers’ efforts, the Bread and Roses Strike was a success. This #3DThursday we honor the women at the front of this movement; women who were willing to risk their jobs and their safety to lead the fight for justice in the workplace. http://www.history.com/news/the-strike-that-shook-america-100-years-ago","link","http://www.history.com/news/the-strike-that-shook-america-100-years-ago","history.com",45,3,3,4,0,0,0,0

Instead of working with Democrats to build upon the ACA’s success – health care coverage for 20 million previously uninsured people, slowed growth of health care costs, and essential reforms that benefit every American – Republicans rushed ahead with a misguided and unfixable bill that was indifferent to the devastating impact it would have on American families. They ignored warnings from the AARP, the American Medical Association and numerous other doctor, nurse, hospital, mental health, and other health care organizations; they disregarded widespread public opposition. As a result, Republican leaders were forced to withdraw their inadequate health care plan from the Floor because it lacked enough support to pass. This even after Republicans spent the past two days making startling, misguided concessions to the farthest right faction of their party, which eliminated coverage of essential health benefits like maternity and newborn care, pediatric services, mental health, preventative care and more. The reality is, “Trumpcare” was indefensible from the outset.  Reforming America’s health care system to bring costs down, make health care more affordable, improve the quality of care, and expand coverage to the uninsured is a complex, monumental task that requires a comprehensive and open-minded approach – something President Obama and Democrats in Congress have long understood, and Republicans seem to be just now discovering for themselves.

They were brought to the United States as children, through no fault of their own and yet the vast majority have grown or are growing into valued, productive members of our communities.  The DACA program, established in June, 2012, allowed some of these individuals who were brought to the United States as children, without legal status, to be considered for relief from deportation.  This program has been essential in bringing these individuals out of the shadows and helping them to contribute to our society in a gainful and legal way. DACA has also been key to better directing immigration resources towards preventing criminals from entering this country. It has been an important program for our national economy, national security and our national values. The Trump Administration’s misguided and cruel decision to eliminate #DACA puts that all in jeopardy and does nothing to fix our country’s broken immigration system. True immigration reform, which we need, will require bipartisan cooperation, not partisan politics and a White House that would punish children for the actions of their parents.

Brian Fitzpatrick. The INTERDICT Act responds to the needs of first responders and recognizes that the 21st century threat of synthetic opioids requires the latest tools to stop them. Providing CBP with more modern equipment and resources will improve their ability to keep these harmful substances out of our country. This bill will be a cutting-edge tool for eliminating synthetic opioids, like fentanyl, from the equation. I thank my House and Senate colleagues for their dedicated partnership, including Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick  Senator Edward J. Markey Senator Marco Rubio U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown Senator Shelley Moore Capito . This was truly a bipartisan effort and I look forward to seeing this important bill signed into law by the President.
