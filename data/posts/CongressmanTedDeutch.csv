We are grateful to Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel and the Broward Sheriff's Office, together with federal, state, and local law enforcement, all of the first responders, the trauma doctors and other health professionals, Red Cross volunteers, government employees, and community members who have come together to support everyone impacted. We will learn more as the investigation continues and will respond as necessary, in the courts and in Congress.   As of 10:00 a.m. Saturday, the airport is open and some flights have resumed. Terminal 2 check-in and ticket counters are open, but baggage claim remains closed. Some flights are being rerouted or canceled, so be sure to check with your airline. Roadways leading to the airport are open.  If you are a friend or family member and are seeking information about an airport passenger that was at the airport during the incident, please call 1-866-435-9355 or 954-831-4000.

It's not just the 20 million Americans newly covered by plans on Healthcare.gov; the law also improved coverage for the 150 million Americans enrolled in plans through their employer, the 55 million disabled Americans and seniors covered by Medicare, and the over 74 million low-income families enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.  What could repeal of the health care law mean? It could mean that your grandmother will pay more for her prescription drugs, or that your niece in graduate school on a limited budget will no longer be able to afford contraceptives, or that your friend's cancer treatment will be interrupted when coverage is pulled because of her pre-existing condition. It could undermine our efforts to stop the onslaught of drug overdose deaths claiming six lives every week in Broward County by allowing insurance companies to arbitrarily refuse to cover mental health and substance abuse services.

I never expected that today, so soon after, we’d be observing another such moment, and for a tragedy so close to home.  We cannot accept a world in which we don’t have time to mourn lives lost in one shooting before another occurs. After the tragedy last summer at Pulse nightclub, after the many stories I’ve heard from constituents affected by gun violence, and now even more than ever after Friday’s shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport, I want no more of these tragedies in my community. I want no more of this unbearable pain in any community. Inaction is no longer an acceptable response.  Sadly, there is now a routine that Congress follows: shocking news of a deadly shooting, followed by conveyance of thoughts and prayers, followed by a moment of silence on the House floor. These moments of silence are a respectful way to reflect on the lives that were taken so tragically. But to truly honor the victims of this and other gun violence, moments of silence must be followed by productive discussions on what meaningful actions should be taken to address the crisis of gun violence.   We must figure out how to get treatment for people with mental illness. We must also keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, and we must prevent potential terrorists from getting their hands on dangerous weapons. If we can’t take these simple, sensible first steps, we will never succeed in preventing shootings like this in the future. Thoughts and prayers will be all we have to give, and that's just not enough.","status",NA,NA,62,11,7,4,0,0,1,0

In a direct attack on this proudly American value, the President’s executive order on refugees starts a period in which the United States closes its doors to the most vulnerable people, including children, seeking safety in our country.   Our top priority is guaranteeing the safety and security of the American people, and I believe we need a thorough and comprehensive vetting process for all people seeking asylum or refuge.   However, the President’s decision - to slam the door on all refugees for four months and Muslim refugees indefinitely, and to cut by more than half the number of refugees seeking safe haven this year - will leave thousands of vulnerable families and children around the world in limbo, leaving them to suffer horrific atrocities and persecution.   This will mean the LGBT individual from Uganda or any country that criminalizes homosexuality, and the thousands of Baha’i, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim refugees persecuted in Iran, would continue to live in fear of persecution without any hope of being welcomed in our country where Lady Liberty’s torch will no longer light a path toward freedom.   This Executive Order will not strengthen our national security, but it will leave thousands of families vulnerable to violence and suffering. Our nation has shut its doors to those fleeing violence before. We should not return to those days.  http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-refugees-20170127-story.html","link","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-refugees-20170127-story.html","latimes.com",91,20,24,2,1,1,16,23

Judge Neil Gorsuch's radical views on federal regulations fly in the face of long-standing Supreme Court precedent and will undermine crucial consumer protections, environmental protections, and labor safety protections. He sided with corporations in the Hobby Lobby decision defining them as people, giving corporations the right to deny women birth control in the name of religious belief. He has publicly attacked everyday Americans for seeking access to our nation’s courts to protect and support their individual rights. His rulings supporting the use of excessive force by law enforcement will be a step-back in our nation’s effort to reform the criminal justice system. And he has consistently sided with corporations and their interests while quashing the ability of employees to protect their rights in the workplace.   If Mitch McConnell wanted to replace the late Justice Scalia with someone with equally or even more extreme views, he’s getting the pick he wanted.

Bob disappeared in Iran on March 9, 2007. This Thursday will mark 10 years since Bob was last seen on Kish Island.  Over the years, I have gotten to know Bob’s wife Christine and his seven children. This incredible family has now gone an agonizing decade without their husband, father, and grandfather. At every opportunity I had to engage directly with President Obama or senior Administration officials, I urged them to press the Iranians on Bob’s case. And I will continue to urge the Trump Administration to do the same.  I have been humbled by the tremendous support my colleagues in the House of Representatives have given to our efforts on Bob’s behalf, and I stand ready to work with anyone committed to bringing Bob home. It is well past time for Iran to fulfill its years of promises to resolve Bob’s case. Each year, I introduce a Congressional resolution on the anniversary of Bob's disappearance. I had hoped we would not have to do it again this year. But this week, I will go to the House floor to again speak about Bob, and I will not stop speaking out for the Levinson family until Bob is back home in South Florida.","link","https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/us/politics/trump-under-pressure-to-resolve-the-disappearance-of-robert-levinson.html?_r=0&referer=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FtuujH8lAC7%3Famp%3D1","mobile.nytimes.com",90,14,12,10,0,0,17,2

""FROM THE WIFE, CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN OF ROBERT LEVINSON, AMERICA'S LONGEST-HELD HOSTAGE IN HISTORY - When is enough enough? It has been 10 years since Robert Levinson, our amazing husband, father and grandfather, was arrested on Kish Island, Iran, and imprisoned. For 10 years the government of Iran has been allowed to dodge and weave every time it was asked to come clean about what happened to Bob and send him home. Where is the outrage of this treatment of an American citizen? For 10 years, over and over and over again, two U.S. Presidents abandoned him, a lifelong public servant. Even Bob's government co-workers and their bosses - they know who they are - ran away when he disappeared, to their lasting shame. Ten years is beyond enough. How much more agony must he withstand? It is time to get Bob Levinson home to his family. And, to Bob, Dad and Grandpa Bob: Stay strong! We know you are alive and trying to come home to us. We love you more than ever. We miss you every hour of the day. We will never, never, ever give up looking for you.""","status",NA,NA,61,5,13,0,0,0,14,0

Ileana broke barriers as the first Hispanic woman elected to Congress and the first female Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. She has been a stalwart champion for human rights around the world, a voice for the oppressed, an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ equality, and one of the most steadfast defenders of Israel.

Her humor and good nature (see photo!) provides a welcome respite from the partisan challenges we face each day. Every Member of Congress should learn something from the way Ileana has conducted herself over the past 28 years. She has crossed the aisle to stand up for what she believes is right.

Adam’s dad called me today to share his deep concerns for his son’s healthcare under the House Republican health bill.  Adam was injured at birth caused by medical malpractice. He is cortically blind, and is a cerebral palsy quadriplegic. Needless to say, the trauma that Adam and his family experienced at birth has only been compounded by crushing medical bills.  Like half of all Americans, Adam's family was covered by an employer-sponsored insurance plan when he was born. But after he was injured, his mom stayed home to care for him and lost her coverage through work. At the time, the individual insurance market was expensive, included annual and lifetime caps, and allowed insurers to deny coverage based on preexisting conditions. After the Affordable Care Act, Adam’s family was able to find a plan in the individual market that provides the coverage he needs.   Adam’s health costs are still a heavy burden, but if the Republican proposal becomes law it will repeal consumer protections that ended annual and lifetime caps on coverage and prevent insurance companies from price gouging Americans based on their health history. Millions of Americans will be completely priced out of coverage.  Adam’s story is like so many others that I’ve heard in the days leading up to today’s vote on the Republican health bill. His family deserves access to coverage even though they are likely to need more care. And every American deserves the same protections when an unfortunate injury, accident, or diagnosis happens to them.   Life is unpredictable. Our health is precious, and our society should guarantee that all Americans are protected against discrimination based on their health status. That’s why I am voting no on this bill, and why I will continue to fight for expanded access to insurance coverage and lower health care costs for all Americans.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanTedDeutch/photos/a.322609467773903.81795.112179098816942/1533946233306881/?type=3",NA,97,31,27,8,0,0,21,5

The American people want better healthcare; they don’t want higher costs, less coverage, and cuts that will jeopardize Medicare and Medicaid.  TrumpCare will allow insurance companies to discriminate against women, charge seniors five times more than younger consumers, hinder our fight against drug overdoses and addiction, and end requirements for essential health benefits like emergency room and mental health care in all health plans. With this vote, Republicans have chosen to put healthcare out of reach for millions.  But beyond the substance, the process has been entirely undemocratic. Republicans locked the American people out of the process, drafting this proposal behind closed doors, holding hearings in the middle of the night, and refusing to wait for an updated report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office so that we know even more about the terrible damage this bill will do.

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and I sent to the President last week. We hope the President's trip is successful in taking steps toward peace.  ""Dear Mr. President:  We are hopeful that your upcoming visit to Israel and Saudi Arabia will be fruitful and help pave the way toward direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians and, with that, hopefully usher in an era of broad acceptance of Israel in the region.  As you and your representatives explore ways to help lay the foundation for a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, it is important to remember that the only path toward a meaningful peace resulting in two states for two peoples, a democratic Jewish state of Israel and a demilitarized Palestinian state, is through direct bilateral negotiations without preconditions. History shows that Israel has been willing to enter into talks and make painful sacrifices for peace if and when it believes there is a sincere and capable partner with whom it can negotiate. Unfortunately, at times when Israel has taken significant steps toward peace, Palestinian leaders have refused to even respond to meaningful proposals.  We hope you urge the Palestinian Authority leadership to take a number of important steps toward lasting peace. First, the Palestinian Authority must cease its glorification of terror and its incitement to violence against Israel. The Palestinian Authority must cease payments to the families of terrorists who are, or were, in Israeli jail or to the families of those who were killed in their efforts to perpetrate terror. These kinds of payments only incentivize terrorism. It must cease to name buildings, schools and town squares after terrorists who have murdered innocent civilians. Ultimately, for a true and lasting peace, the Palestinian leadership must educate the next generation for peace and coexistence, not support for terrorism.  And finally, the Palestinian Authority must cease efforts to isolate and delegitimize Israel and the United Nations and other international bodies, including its efforts to circumvent direct negotiations by seeking unilateral statehood through these bodies.  As Members of Congress deeply committed to the U.S. - Israel relationship, we look forward to continuing our cooperation with Israel on a broad array of issues. We value our shared commitment to human rights and democracy, and we remain hopeful that meaningful peace will result in lasting security and prosperity for both Israel and the Palestinians.  Mr. President, your trip presents an important opportunity to lay the foundation for a return to direct negotiations, with the goal of a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. We stand ready to assist you in this important effort.""","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanTedDeutch/photos/a.693669100667936.1073741829.112179098816942/1551325068235664/?type=3",NA,57,4,3,5,0,0,0,0

If a President’s budget is meant to convey his values and priorities, then President Trump is making quite clear his contempt for working families and the most vulnerable Americans. In the President’s ideal America, the extremely rich receive more from the government, and everyone else receives dramatically less.  This callous budget would severely scale back healthcare for children of low-income families and nutritional assistance programs. Despite promises not to cut Medicaid, the President wants to cut $610 billion from the anti-poverty program, on top of the $839 billion Medicaid cuts that House Republicans cut in the dangerous healthcare bill they recently passed. The President’s budget director claims that this plan will encourage more people to find jobs; yet, he proposes slashing already existing tax incentives for low-income Americans to enter the workforce.  The budget would cut life-saving programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that lead our country’s response to epidemics at home and abroad and our search for vaccines and cures to deadly diseases. The National Cancer Institute alone would lose $1 billion compared to last year’s budget. And crucial funding for scientific and medical grants across the government would be drastically reduced.  Despite the President’s enormous defense budget increases, this budget will not make Americans safer. Ignoring scientific consensus, the President wants to eliminate important climate change programs that engage with the private sector and international partners to reduce emissions and respond to the impacts of climate change, impacts we are already facing in South Florida. And at a time when more Jewish students are reporting incidents of anti-Semitism on college campuses across the country, the President wants to weaken the Department of Education’s Civil Rights division that oversees religious-based crimes in schools.   For Floridians, this budget would be particularly painful. The President offers no funding for FEMA’s flood hazard mapping program, a crucial service for South Floridians living in flood-prone areas. The President’s budget cuts nearly $9 billion from our public education system, including teacher training programs and after school services for lower-income students. And an EPA program that helps monitor threatening levels of nutrients in the Everglades would be wiped out.  And in a cold, brazen, and unprecedented move, the President explicitly calls out a single organization – Planned Parenthood – by name to restrict it from providing essential health programs for millions of women like cancer screenings and maternity check-ups.  Just like so many of his other broken promises, the President’s budget isn’t a foundation for ‘American Greatness’ but rather a recipe for weakness, destitution, and devastation.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/opinion/trump-federal-budget.html","nytimes.com",72,19,35,2,0,0,3,27

This partisan legislation was clearly not written to improve healthcare for the American people – how else could they explain their mean-spirited proposal to rip healthcare away from millions while giving tax breaks to the wealthiest?  This bill is not an improvement on the House Republicans’ terrible bill – it’s the same wolf in a different sheep’s clothing. Let’s not forget that under the House bill, 23 million Americans would lose coverage. The Senate Republican plan puts a heavier cost burden on low-income Americans to pay more for their care by cutting subsidies and gutting Medicaid.  For people living with pre-existing conditions, or with diseases that have exorbitant treatment costs, or with maternity and newborn care needs, or mental health illnesses, the Senate Republicans open it up for states to turn back the clock and legalize discrimination against them.   As South Florida struggles to respond to the growing opioid addiction crisis, Senate Republicans show only callous indifference by including a one-time only payment for opioid services, rather than tens of billions of dollars over a decade that will make the serious investment in treatment that this horrific epidemic requires.   And Senate Republicans continue their attack on women’s healthcare by defunding Planned Parenthood, blocking access to cancer screenings and maternity care for low-income women, and making it more difficult for women receiving federal subsidies to access abortion services.  The clock is finally ticking for the American people to review this bill before the Senate rushes it to a vote in only one week. Republicans chose to hide this bill during the drafting process. Now, as we learn the details, Senate Republicans will hear loud and clear from the American people that this cruel bill will make it harder for them to stay healthy without going broke.","status",NA,NA,68,21,20,0,0,0,11,23

There, I heard some moving personal stories that I want to share with all of you.   In Boca Raton, a woman and her young daughter shared their commitment to  fighting for research that can lead to treatments and cures for childhood cancer. They're right. We devote such a small amount of research money to this battle, and our kids need us to fight for them. I promised her I'd always support childhood cancer research, and I asked her for a photo of her daughter so I can be reminded of their powerful advocacy.    One transgender attendee powerfully expressed the pain felt by the President's decision to ban transgender individuals from serving in our armed forces and on the challenges faced when companies treat you as something less than human. I'm proud to be a vice chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, and we can't stop fighting until the Equality Act is law, prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.   And finally, I heard from someone who immigrated to the US as child. He's undocumented, though America is the only home he knows, and he's currently in graduate school pursuing his third degree. He spoke powerfully about why we need the Dream Act of 2017 to protect people like him and the damage that cruelly revoking DACA would do to over 800,000 Dreamers.    These are just a few examples of why Town Hall meetings are important for elected officials to hold. Hearing first-hand what matters most to you allows me to take your concerns back to Washington when Congress returns next week. Thanks to all who attended my Town Hall meetings, and thanks for making your voices heard!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanTedDeutch/photos/a.322609467773903.81795.112179098816942/1665855343449302/?type=3",NA,120,13,7,11,0,0,0,0

The DACA program is not a free government handout, and it’s not an amnesty program. DACA has allowed the estimated 800,000 people in our country, almost 33,000 in Florida, who were brought to the US at young ages through no fault of their own to come out of the shadows and become contributing members of our society. They are hard-working young people who want nothing more than to have all the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.  I've heard from many DREAMers in South Florida who have shared how much this program has meant to them and the severe and personal damage revoking DACA will have on their lives and their families. Though they were not born here, America is the country they proudly call home.  It's unconscionable that the Trump Administration announced its intention to kick out these hardworking, committed young adults and break up families when these DREAMers have known no other country but the United States. It is inhumane to send these young people to countries they have no connection to, countries where they may not even speak the language.  President Trump said he would treat DREAMers with heart and with compassion, but this act is heartless and disregards their plight. Congress must finally act to protect these DREAMers by passing bipartisan, comprehensive, and compassionate immigration reform. And the President must show some humanity by signing it.","status",NA,NA,205,67,32,9,2,2,15,4

Tens of millions of American families could see higher taxes from this plan.

Restoring the Palestinian Authority’s control in Gaza would be a critical step toward improving the lives of the nearly two million Palestinians living under brutal Hamas leadership and the Israeli civilians living in perpetual fear of rocket fire, terror attacks, and cross border kidnappings. However, Hamas’ failure to commit to disarming and renouncing terrorism and violence precludes it from being a legitimate partner.   From the little we know of the details of the agreement, there is no obligation for Hamas to give up its weapons or disband its terrorist military wing. After decades of killing innocent Israelis and pledging to destroy the Jewish State, we have seen no indication that they intend to change. Just this morning a Hamas leader made clear his goal of uniting ‘against the Zionist enterprise.’  Any future Palestinian government that includes Hamas must agree to fully disarm the terrorist group, renounce violence, recognize Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state, honor existing agreements, and commit to peace and security with Israel. This announced deal does not do that.

Our bill renews the now-expired prohibition on the transfer, importation, or possession of magazines able to hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.  Thirteen years since the large capacity ammunition ban lapsed, Congress has repeatedly failed to act to protect the American people. Gun owners – whether for hunting or self-defense – have no need for magazines that hold more than ten rounds of ammunition, and restricting it will prevent the scale of mass shootings that we’ve seen all too frequently in recent years.

The President is actively working to hurt American families, and add $194 billion to the deficit to make a political point. Millions of Americans depend on these subsidies to get access to care, and millions more hard working middle-class families will see their premiums increase as a direct result of the President’s action.  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, this move will leave one million Americans without health insurance next year, and will lead to an additional 20 percent increase in premiums for most Americans. On top of this, many insurance companies will leave markets entirely, leaving an estimated five percent of current enrollees with no insurance options in their area.  Less than three weeks away from open enrollment under the Affordable Care Act, President Trump has shown that he has no idea what it is like for the millions of Americans with ongoing, expensive health needs and an uncertain future.  As with prior attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in Congress, the President's executive order will jeopardize access to care for cancer patients, children born with congenital diseases, expecting mothers, and ailing seniors.  Congress should act quickly, in a bipartisan manner, to protect the progress we’ve made toward helping more Americans afford healthcare and working to expand access to all Americans. The President's executive order and the Ryan-McConnell efforts in Congress make the work ahead so much more difficult.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/us/politics/trump-obamacare-executive-order-health-insurance.html?_r=0","nytimes.com",39,55,24,3,3,0,11,48

Too many children have lost parents, and too many parents have lost their children. Opioid drug addiction is a heartbreaking disease that cuts through society, affecting people regardless of race, income level, or hometown.  In Florida, an estimated 4,000 people lost their lives last year to opioid overdose. And this crisis is far from over. In the first half of this year an estimated 14 Floridians and 142 Americans nation-wide died each day.  President Trump’s decision to declare a public health emergency will hopefully lead to a wider response by the federal government to this national epidemic. But we must do more. This is a complex problem, and we need to fight it on multiple fronts.  The President’s public health emergency declaration stops short of the recommendations of his opioid commission, which called for declaring a national state of emergency. The federal response to this years-long deeply-rooted crisis demands a robust response. I will continue to fight for additional resources beyond the mere $57,000 remaining in the public health emergency fund unlocked by this declaration. Doing so will require continued bipartisan cooperation and investing in lasting solutions.  It’s also past time for Governor Scott to reconsider his refusal to expand Medicaid, so that 800,000 more low-income Floridians can access care. Too many Floridians have died while Governor Scott has withheld treatment available through Medicaid expansion. Earlier this year, Republican Governor of Ohio John Kasich said, ‘Thank God we expanded Medicaid because that Medicaid money is helping to rehab people.’ Yet, Governor Scott is denying that same assistance to 300,000 eligible Floridians who are already in need of mental health and substance abuse care.   This will be a long battle. It will require more than declarations. But hopefully, this is a first step toward a constructive relationship between the White House and Congress toward a goal that every American, Republicans and Democrats, should share: ending the deadly opioid crisis.","status",NA,NA,53,18,9,2,0,0,3,1

This important visit helped lead to the establishment of a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt, the first Arab nation to enter into such an agreement with Israel.   Last night’s event came only a week after a horrific terror attack on a Sufi mosque in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, in which over 300 worshippers, including children, were killed. We mourn the tragic loss of life and pledge our commitment to help Egypt and our allies fight against those who wish to attack innocent civilians and destabilize nations.  The Sadat anniversary serves as a reminder of the bravery and strong leadership of President Sadat, who took an unpopular but vital step to bring peace to the region. Forty years later, as the region continues to strive for peace, more leaders should learn from President Sadat’s courageous act.  Unfortunately, strong leadership was absent yesterday when the UN voted repeatedly to condemn Israel, while the murderous Assad regime, with Iran’s military support, continues its campaign against its own people that has led to over half a million civilian deaths. The UN should stop passing anti-Israel resolutions and start taking real action toward protecting the Syrian people, ending the bloody war, and halting Iranian aggression that puts Iranian proxies just 20 kilometers from Israel.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanTedDeutch/photos/a.322609467773903.81795.112179098816942/1756518281049674/?type=3",NA,71,6,3,11,0,1,0,0

Despite their promises, there's no great tax simplification or benefit for middle-class Americans. This is a massive, permanent giveaway to the largest corporations, encouraging them to ship more American jobs overseas, while short-changing middle-class families with limited temporary breaks and raising taxes on 86 million American households.  There's no magic math here; adding over $2 trillion to the national debt will force automatic cuts to Medicare and give Republicans cover to attempt to gut Social Security and other vital programs in the future. Republicans would rather satisfy campaign promises using false – and disproven – promises of economic growth than sit down with Democrats and tax experts on a comprehensive, bipartisan proposal.

In the introduction to today’s resolution, Yemen’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Khaled Hussein Mohamed Alyemany, said that the 'Israeli occupation is the source of all instability in the region.'  He could not have made it more obvious that today’s resolution was just another illustration of the unhealthy obsession with Israel at the UN.  Israel is not the source of the horrific Civil War ravaging Alyemany’s own country, Yemen, where decades of internal strife are now being inflamed by regional intervention from Iran and Saudi Arabia.  Israel was not the source of the Arab Spring that led to the overthrow of repressive autocratic regimes across the region and subsequent instability from unrealized promises of revolution.  Israel is not the source of the war in Syria in which the Assad regime, aligned with Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia, has killed more than half a million Syrians and displaced millions more.   Today’s UN General Assembly vote is another example of this important international organization being sadly undermined by its obsessive focus on Israel.  Today’s resolution wrongly suggests that the President’s announcement on Jerusalem somehow, ‘altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem.’   Recognizing that Jerusalem is Israel’s capital does not change the reality on the ground nor does it preclude direct negotiations that can lead to the establishment of a future Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel.  Nothing the U.S. said changes the importance of Jerusalem to the three monotheistic faiths, nor does it prevent the ability to practice one’s faith in the ancient city.  Tomorrow is the holiest day of the week in Islam and thousands of Muslims will continue to pray on the Temple Mount at the al Aqsa Mosque.  On Friday night and Saturday, thousands of Jews will welcome the Sabbath at the Western Wall, the Kotel.  And on Christmas Eve Sunday and on Christmas Monday, Christians will pray at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.  The President's announcement does not change the status quo in the Old City where the Islamic Waqf, under the custodianship of Jordan, manages the Muslim holy sites; the Israeli Rabbinate manages the Jewish holy sites; and Christian Churches manage the Christian holy sites.  That is why Ambassador Haley was right to vote against the resolution and to veto a similar resolution in the UN Security Council.  I hope that we can now move beyond this distraction and urgently return to a process that advances a sustainable two-state solution.  We need to see change at the UN. We need membership standards for the UN Human Rights Council so that human rights abusers cannot use the platform to hide their own human rights violations. And we need to reform the council by removing Standing Agenda Item 7 that is used to repeatedly target Israel instead of addressing real crises.  Ambassador Haley and I have spoken directly about the urgent need to make these changes.   But in order to effect this change we must remain engaged at the UN. I hope America does not shy away from its critical role as a global leader at the UN and beyond. The best way to protect our national security and advance the interest of America and our allies is to be a leader on the world stage rather than retreating within our own borders.","status",NA,NA,79,39,6,5,0,0,0,0

Unfortunately, the stop-gap spending bill passed earlier this month fails provide long term stability to this vital issue by reauthorizing and fully funding CHIP.  We should have acted on this issue before leaving Washington. I've heard from many constituents concerned about the long-term future of CHIP, and I want you to know that I'm determined to continue to work on this important issue when we return in the New Year. I hope Congressional leadership can reach across the aisle to secure long-term funds for this program that has historically enjoyed bipartisan support.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/20/us/2-million-children-risk-losing-health-care-CHIP.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=1","nytimes.com",25,22,16,0,1,0,13,23
