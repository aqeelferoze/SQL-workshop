There is no national security interest more vital to the United States of America than the ability to hold free and fair elections without foreign interference. That is why Congress must set partisanship aside, follow the facts, and work together to devise comprehensive solutions to deter, defend against, and, when necessary, respond to foreign cyberattacks...  What seems clear is that our adversaries have reached a common conclusion: that the reward for attacking America in cyberspace outweighs the risk. For years, cyberattacks on our nation have been met with indecision and inaction. Our nation has had no policy, and thus no strategy, for cyber deterrence. This appearance of weakness has been provocative to our adversaries, who have attacked us again and again, with growing severity. Unless we demonstrate that the costs of attacking the United States outweigh the perceived benefits, these cyber threats will only grow.

For the sake of America’s national security and that of our allies, I hope President Trump will put an end to this speculation and reject such a reckless course. If he does not, I will work with my colleagues to codify sanctions against Russia into law.  In just the last three years under Vladimir Putin, Russia has invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, threatened NATO allies, and intervened militarily in Syria, leaving a trail of death, destruction, and broken promises in his wake.  Russia’s war on Ukraine has killed over 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians. Russia supplied the weapons that shot down a commercial aircraft over Ukraine and killed 298 innocent people.  Russia has conducted a massive military buildup along NATO’s eastern flank, conducted large-scale military exercises, violated the borders, airspace, and territorial waters of its neighbors, and intensified its propaganda efforts to undermine the governments of our allies.  Russia has propped up the murderous Assad regime as it has waged war on the Syrian people and killed more than 400,000 civilians. Russia’s military has targeted Syrian hospitals and first responders with precision weapons. Instead of targeting ISIL, Russia has focused its operations against the moderate Syrian opposition, which has only empowered extremist forces in the country.  And in the most flagrant demonstration of Putin’s disdain and disrespect for our nation, Russia deliberately interfered in our recent election with cyberattacks and a disinformation campaign designed to weaken America and discredit Western values.  Each of our last three presidents had high hopes for building a partnership with the Russian government. Each attempt failed, not for lack of good faith and effort on the U.S. side, but because Putin wants to be our enemy. He needs us as his enemy. He will never be our partner, including in fighting ISIL. He believes that strengthening Russia means weakening America. President Trump should remember this when he speaks to Vladimir Putin. He should remember that the man on the other end of the line is a murderer and a thug who seeks to undermine American national security interests at every turn. For our commander-in-chief to think otherwise would be naïve and dangerous.","status",NA,NA,138191,11817,50563,6255,115,3136,570,1067

It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump’s executive order was not properly vetted. We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security.   Such a hasty process risks harmful results. We should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home. We should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help. And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children.  Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism. At this very moment, American troops are fighting side-by-side with our Iraqi partners to defeat ISIL. But this executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies. Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.","status",NA,NA,288231,21474,100376,16188,180,499,1842,4917

Under this regulation, contractors are required to report any violation of 14 different labor and employment laws and executive orders. However, the rule’s overly broad definition of “violation” includes minor citations and unproven allegations, effectively creating a “guilty until proven innocent” policy. As a result, contractors could lose the ability to work with the federal government based on unfounded charges before they are able to adjudicate such claims.This rule also contradicts laws already in place, such as the Federal Arbitration Act, that currently permits businesses to resolve disputes more fairly and efficiently.  I voted to repeal this burdensome regulation because I want to give Arizona companies the opportunity to grow and create jobs – not lose business while they adjudicate charges internally!","status",NA,NA,358,265,30,4,1,5,11,93

For too long, individuals brave enough to come forward with the truth about mismanagement at the VA have been punished.  Today’s executive order is an important first step in creating a culture of accountability at the VA. The Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act that was enacted in 2014 provided the VA Secretary greater authority to fire high-level employees for wrongdoing. However, only one person to-date has been fired for their role in the wait-time scandal in which dozens of veterans died while waiting on non-existent lists.  That’s why I have cosponsored numerous pieces of legislation which would expand the authority of the VA Secretary to remove bad actors. I hope that under new leadership, the VA can embrace these principles to ensure our nation’s veterans receive the best quality care they have earned and deserve. I look forward to working with the Trump Administration to enact meaningful solutions that improve veterans’ health care, expand veterans choice, strengthen accountability, and protect whistleblowers.","link","https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=press-releases&id=74C1935A-E85A-43B9-926C-2E4B36F64936","mccain.senate.gov",616,201,60,28,16,3,0,5

Hardly any at all. And what has Russia’s reaction been to America’s tepid response to its aggression? More aggression, more interference and more meddling in foreign elections.   Sooner or later, there will be another American election that captures Russian attention and interest. The victim of their cyber warfare may be a Republican or a Democrat, but to Putin it won’t matter, because his targets are not Republicans or Democrats, but Americans and all that we stand for as a people.

Putin did this because he opposes the spread of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law across Europe, which is advanced by the European Union and protected by the NATO alliance.  On April 14, Montenegro’s Special Prosecutor filed indictments against two Russians and 12 other people for their roles in the coup attempt. This past week, a Montenegrin court accepted the indictments.

Earlier this year, the VA assured Congress that it would have about $1.1 billion left to operate the Veterans Choice Program when it was originally set to expire by law on August 7th. As a result, the House and Senate worked to pass and the president signed into law legislation that eliminated the sunset date on the program and allowed the VA to use the remaining funds to operate it without disruption. However, the VA recently realized that the veteran use and utilization rate for the Veterans Choice Program was much higher than anticipated and that the VA would no longer have enough funds to operate the program through the current fiscal year.‎  You testified that removing this sunset date would have allowed the Veterans Choice Program to extend well beyond this fiscal year and at least partially into fiscal year 2018 … Since then, you realized that due to strong demand for the Veterans Choice Program among veteran patients, the expenditure for the program was higher than anticipated – so much so that the VA will no longer have enough funds to operate the Veterans Choice Program through the current fiscal year.   The VA has put Congress in yet another precarious situation of the VA’s own making and requires a bail out to address the fiscal year 2017 shortfall or the VA will remove access to care for veterans under the Veterans Choice Program. There are limited options available to provide authority to the VA and we seek a detailed and thorough explanation as to what the VA needs to sustain the Veterans Choice Program through the remainder of the fiscal year as well as how the VA will keep the Veterans Choice Program up-and-running into fiscal year 2018.","link","https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=8175059E-0AF4-43FB-A61B-1F1EEB493E45","mccain.senate.gov",250,148,45,7,3,22,28,10

As the Post story also makes clear, the Obama administration failed to impose any meaningful costs on Russia for its attack on American democracy last year—a failure, sadly, that has not been rectified yet by the current administration or by the Congress.  The sanctions legislation that the Senate passed recently is the beginning of a more serious response, and it is essential that the Congress delay no further and send this legislation to the President for his signature.

Fortunately, the plan never got off the ground, but this heinous plot should be a warning to every American that we cannot treat Russia’s interference in our 2016 election as an isolated incident.

Sergei Magnitsky was a Russian attorney working on behalf of his clients nearly a decade ago when he uncovered deep-seated corruption, and as any good lawyer would do, he reported his findings to Russian authorities. For doing his job, he was summarily arrested, jailed, tortured and killed. In his name, we wrote legislation to hold accountable those Russian authorities directly and indirectly responsible for his death by freezing their assets, denying them access to American financial institutions and preventing them from traveling to the United States.  The law also enables similar sanctions on those who engage in gross human rights violations in Russia, where unfortunately, the abuses and due process breaches seen in Sergei’s case are widespread. The law serves as a deterrent for would-be perpetrators of abuses in Russia, and demonstrates a meaningful step we can take as American lawmakers who believe in advancing the rule of law and core human freedoms the world over. We were thrilled when our colleagues joined us last year in advancing the same standards at the global level via the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which was included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.  These laws are an American gold standard, and other countries around the world have passed or are pursuing similar legislation. We appreciate that the Trump Administration has so far signaled it will continue to enforce both laws, and we look forward to working with them on robust implementation of this powerful foreign policy tool.","link","https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=7686F385-DC5F-450D-A8F6-114B6B4DD441","mccain.senate.gov",810,243,124,45,6,7,7,21

A Nobel Peace Prize laureate who was wrongly imprisoned by the Chinese government for nearly a decade, Dr. Liu was a champion for human rights throughout his life. From protesting at Tiananmen Square to authoring a human rights manifesto for which he was unjustly jailed, Dr. Liu was relentless in his pursuit of a democratic China. As he suffered from late-term liver cancer in prison, the Chinese government’s delay in treatment was the last barbaric violation of Dr. Liu’s human rights.  Even as it brutalizes its own citizens, China has continually bullied its neighbors and destabilized the Asia-Pacific region by militarizing the South China Sea and propping up the North Korean regime.

The Senate will now adjourn and senators will head home for a long weekend in our respective states, leaving Washington with no timetable for authorizing funding for our troops, no consensus on how to fund the government, no path forward on regular appropriations bills, and no plan to address the debt limit. And while we mull over another revision to the Senate health care bill, we still lack consensus on how to repeal and replace the failed policies of Obamacare, a law that is imploding in the State of Arizona as premiums skyrocket and insurers flee the marketplace. This is not what the American people expect of us, and it’s not what they deserve.  The revised Senate health care bill released today does not include the measures I have been advocating for on behalf of the people of Arizona. That’s why if the Senate takes up this legislation, I intend to file amendments that would address the concerns raised by Arizona Governor Doug Ducey and other leaders across our state about the bill’s impact on Arizona’s Medicaid system. Arizona has been nationally recognized for running one of the most efficient and cost-effective Medicaid programs in the country. This legislation should reward states like Arizona that are responsibly managing their health care services and controlling costs – not penalize them.  Have no doubt: Congress must replace Obamacare, which has hit Arizonans with some of the highest premium increases in the nation and left 14 of Arizona’s 15 counties with only one provider option on the exchanges this year. But if we are not able to reach a consensus, the Senate should return to regular order, hold hearings and receive input from senators of both parties, and produce a bill that finally provides Americans with access to affordable and quality health care.  If the Senate proceeds to the revised health care bill, Senator McCain plans to file amendments that would ensure Arizona is not penalized for voters’ decision in 2000 to expand Medicaid before the Affordable Care Act was enacted; extend the phase-out period of Medicaid expansion to provide states like Arizona the necessary time to adjust their budgets so citizens don’t have the rug pulled out from under them; and change the growth rate for Medicaid so that Arizona is not punished for operating a successful Medicaid program that cuts costs and streamlines services.","link","https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=press-releases&id=FD3E4602-DFAF-4705-BB95-C8791E4BBAAC","mccain.senate.gov",643,2446,152,12,9,13,85,211

This illegal proclamation of a Russian puppet state in eastern Ukraine also adds to Russia’s serial violations of the Minsk agreements. Through its aggressive behavior, Russia has demonstrated it does not seek the peace the Minsk agreements were designed to achieve. Instead, Vladimir Putin is calculating that the more Ukrainians his forces and his proxies kill, the more Ukrainian territory they will be able to seize. And the more Putin forces Ukraine to devote scarce resources to war rather than improving the economy, the more he can destabilize the government in Kiev and prevent Ukraine from realizing its Euro-Atlantic future.  The United States and our European allies must honestly confront the reality that we have failed to fundamentally change Russia’s calculus in Ukraine over the last three years.  If we are serious about ending the bloodletting in eastern Ukraine and restoring Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, we must be willing to think and act anew to compel a change in Russian behavior. It is simply not enough, for example, to say that U.S. and European sanctions imposed after the annexation of Crimea will remain until Russia fulfills its obligations under the Minsk agreements. That approach has been tried, and it has failed. Acting together, the United States and our European allies need to develop a policy and strategy to escalate the diplomatic, economic, and military consequences Russia will suffer until it honors its commitments under the Minsk agreements.

Any American who meets current medical and readiness standards should be allowed to continue serving. There is no reason to force service members who are able to fight, train, and deploy to leave the military—regardless of their gender identity. We should all be guided by the principle that any American who wants to serve our country and is able to meet the standards should have the opportunity to do so—and should be treated as the patriots they are.  The Department of Defense is currently conducting a study on the medical obligations it would incur, the impact on military readiness, and related questions associated with the accession of transgender individuals who are not currently serving in uniform and wish to join the military.

The rupture could leave the Potrero Creek vulnerable to exposure of 15 million gallons of untreated sewage that flow through this pipeline every day. If left unattended, this spill could now flow through the Santa Cruz River, impacting countless communities in its path. I have addressed issues surrounding the management of this pipeline numerous times over the last ten years, most recently by introducing the Nogales Wastewater Fairness Act, which would transfer the unfair financial burden of maintenance and capital upgrades of the IOI pipeline from the City of Nogales to the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC).  The IBWC, which is tasked with the management of international water and boundary treaties, should be responsible for managing the infrastructure it relies on so heavily for international gain. Around 14 million gallons of sewage treated by the Nogales International Sanitation Project come from Mexico, leaving Nogales, Arizona, with an unfair burden of maintenance and upkeep. Breaches in the pipeline, like the one that occurred yesterday, are bound to happen when such responsibility is not appropriately shared.  My staff is on-site in Nogales and working closely with state and local officials to provide assistance as the city moves forward on repairs. I will continue my efforts in Congress, including through legislation, to address this long-standing issue and prevent breaches like this from occurring in the future.","link","https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=7B3E62EF-657C-4C28-833F-9A974D95420B","mccain.senate.gov",959,2822,146,26,3,126,73,187

Many of the amendment’s provisions, which impose comprehensive sanctions on Russia for its cyber intrusions, aggression, and destabilizing activities, were first introduced in January by Chairman McCain and Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD), Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

From the beginning, I have believed that Obamacare should be repealed and replaced with a solution that increases competition, lowers costs, and improves care for the American people. The so-called ‘skinny repeal’ amendment the Senate voted on today would not accomplish those goals. While the amendment would have repealed some of Obamacare’s most burdensome regulations, it offered no replacement to actually reform our health care system and deliver affordable, quality health care to our citizens. The Speaker's statement that the House would be ‘willing’ to go to conference does not ease my concern that this shell of a bill could be taken up and passed at any time.  I’ve stated time and time again that one of the major failures of Obamacare was that it was rammed through Congress by Democrats on a strict-party line basis without a single Republican vote. We should not make the mistakes of the past that has led to Obamacare’s collapse, including in my home state of Arizona where premiums are skyrocketing and health care providers are fleeing the marketplace. We must now return to the correct way of legislating and send the bill back to committee, hold hearings, receive input from both sides of aisle, heed the recommendations of nation’s governors, and produce a bill that finally delivers affordable health care for the American people.

I still remember joining other aviators as we escaped our aircraft; jumping to the burning flight deck below and rolling through burning jet fuel to avoid the heat and flame. While some of us were fortunate to make it out of the fire, many of the ship’s crew came charging in poised to fight back. The awesome courage on display that day, to fight the fires through the night and early into the next morning – nearly 18 hours – saved our ship and saved countless more lives. I’ll never forget the heroes that perished that day. Let us always remember their sacrifice.  By honoring those who perished during catastrophes such as these, we begin to understand the true costs of war. The profession of arms is inherently dangerous. Driving warships across oceans to foreign shores is dangerous. The coordinated ballet of Naval aviation flight operations is dangerous.

This legislation will now be sent to the President’s desk for signature.   Congress created the Veterans Choice Program in the wake of the scandal in care at the Phoenix VA and VA hospitals around the country to ensure that veterans who live far from a VA facility or can’t get a timely appointment have access to care in their own communities,” said Senator McCain. “Since the program’s creation, veterans have scheduled more that 8.7 million appointments for care in the community using the Choice Card. That is 2.6 million more appointments than last year or a 46 percent increase. These represent millions of appointments that would have otherwise been stuck for weeks or months in the VA’s scheduling system. We simply cannot afford to let this program expire and send our veterans back to the status quo of never-ending wait-times for appointments and substandard care. The Senate’s passage of this bill to preserve the Veterans Choice Program is an important step forward in ensuring our veterans continue to get the very best care when they need it and in their own communities.”  Specifically, the legislation would provide funding for the Veterans Choice Program through the rest of the year and into the next fiscal year. In addition, the legislation would authorize 28 major medical facility leases and put in place reforms to strengthen the VA’s ability to recruit, train and retain its workforce. Finally, the legislation would provide Congress necessary time to work with VA Secretary Shulkin on improving and refining the Veterans Choice Program in order to develop a more consolidated and standardized network for community care.","link","https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=A2EE76AC-90F0-43F8-92F3-A7AAEB085B82","mccain.senate.gov",966,364,71,62,1,2,1,17

The concerns expressed in the President’s signing statement are hardly surprising, though misplaced. The Framers of our Constitution made the Congress and the President coequal branches of government. This bill has already proven the wisdom of that choice.  While the American people surely hope for better relations with Russia, what this legislation truly represents is their insistence that Vladimir Putin and his regime must pay a real price for attacking our democracy, violating human rights, occupying Crimea, and destabilizing Ukraine. On this critical issue of national security policy, it was the Congress that acted in the spirit of national unity to carry out the will of the American people. And that is why it is critical that the President comply with the letter and spirit of this legislation and fully implement all of its provisions.

As these discussions move forward, it’s critical for the administration to focus on strengthening and modernizing this free trade agreement, which has significantly benefited the American people.  Over the last two decades under NAFTA, trade with Mexico and Canada has increased exports, created jobs, improved wages, and lowered the cost of goods and services. Today, Mexico is Arizona’s number-one trading partner, and contributed to $15.7 billion in bilateral trade in 2016 that supported 90,000 jobs in the state. Arizona is not alone. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates 14 million jobs in the United States are tied to trade with Mexico and Canada.  As renegotiations get underway, it’s important for the administration to recognize NAFTA’s many contributions and not impose new barriers that could harm our ability to trade with our closest neighbors. Along with the countless individuals in my home state and around the country who have benefited from NAFTA, I urge the administration to pursue an outcome that does not pick winners or losers, but further promotes the free flow of trade with Mexico and Canada that has and will continue to boost our economy.","link","https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=4070742C-D01F-48F6-9AE3-F8E65E2232FD","mccain.senate.gov",1449,1205,163,93,46,7,7,33

While we welcome this elevation, there is much more to be done to prepare our nation and our military to meet our cybersecurity challenges. We must develop a clear policy and strategy for deterring and responding to cyber threats. We must also develop an integrated, whole-of-government approach to protect and defend the United States from cyberattacks. The Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act includes provisions to improve some of these deficiencies.  I also appreciate the administration’s commitment today to ensuring that a future separation of the so-called “dual hat” relationship between Cyber Command and the National Security Agency will be based on conditions, rather than arbitrary political timelines. While Cyber Command and the National Security Agency should eventually be able to operate independent of one another, the administration must work closely with the Congress to take the necessary steps that will make this separation of responsibilities successful, and to ensure that each agency will emerge more effective and more capable as a result.  The Senate Armed Services Committee will continue its oversight and seek answers to all of these important questions, and more, through the upcoming consideration of the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act and the advice and consent process on a new commander of Cyber Command.","link","https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=press-releases&id=AABC23A2-4EE8-414F-B901-247590FAF9B9","mccain.senate.gov",910,448,75,56,3,3,0,19

The unfortunate truth is that this strategy is long overdue, and in the interim, the Taliban have made dangerous inroads. Nevertheless, I believe the President is now moving us well beyond the prior administration’s failed strategy of merely postponing defeat.  It is especially important that the newly announced strategy gives no timeline for withdrawal, rather ensures that any decision to reduce our commitment in the future will be based on conditions on the ground. The President is also correct to frame this new effort as a comprehensive regional strategy. Preventing another attack on our homeland and helping our Afghan allies secure the future of their country is not just a matter of troop levels in Afghanistan. It requires the broad application of all the tools of American statecraft throughout the region.  For the last 16 years we have faltered. Now we must keep up the right level of effort, in the right places, with the right authorities and resources, together with our allies and partners, and see this conflict through to success. To do this, the President must conduct himself as a wartime commander-in-chief. He must speak regularly to the American people, and to those waging this war on their behalf, about why we are fighting, why the additional sacrifices are worth it, and how we will succeed.  At the same time, the Congress must meet its responsibilities for overseeing the war in Afghanistan and providing the necessary resources for it. The Senate Armed Services Committee will continue to meet its special obligations in this regard, beginning with a hearing on this new strategy in September. Congress has a role to play in sending America’s young men and women into harm’s way, and we intend to exercise that responsibility.  The road ahead will not be easy, but America and the world cannot afford an Afghanistan that is under control of the Taliban and other terrorist organizations.","link","https://medium.com/@SenatorJohnMcCain/a-step-in-the-right-direction-in-afghanistan-490ceaab72f","medium.com",1788,1020,188,103,21,36,32,263

In many instances, we now see a blending of conventional and unconventional means of power projection, along with a profusion of actors that makes it difficult to distinguish crime or terrorism from state-sponsored activity.  Against this background, the rapid development and deployment of information technology by American businesses and by our government has created new vulnerabilities. The entire information domain has become a potential battle space, and our enemies’ methods encompass everything from straightforward data collection to hacking attacks that might disable critical national infrastructure.   This is why I am so proud of the work being done here in Arizona. I know of nowhere else in America where public-private partnership in cyber defense is better cultivated and developed. Here we already have in place new capabilities to share actionable information and to train Arizonans to repel cyberattacks. Our state has established an impressive array of unique assets, including the Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center and its sister organization, the Arizona Cyber Threat Response Alliance.

Earlier this week, President Trump took a step forward when he changed course and departed from his predecessor's failed policy in Afghanistan. The President now has the same opportunity with regard to Ukraine.  It is long past time for the United States to provide Ukraine the defensive lethal assistance it needs to deter and defend against further Russian aggression. Raising the cost of aggression may help to change Vladimir Putin's calculus, pressure Russia to fully comply with the Minsk agreements, and, ultimately, create more stable security conditions on the ground that are essential for peace. In other words, providing defensive lethal assistance to Ukraine is not opposed to a peaceful resolution of this conflict – it is essential to achieving it. As long as the status quo remains, Russia has no reason to change its behavior, and we should only expect more violence and more death.  Several weeks ago, the President took the first significant step toward imposing costs on Russian aggression when he signed into law new sanctions passed by Congress. Changing U.S. policy to provide lethal defensive assistance to Ukraine would be another step in the right direction – sending a strong signal that the United States will stand by the sovereign right of its allies and partners to choose their own future.","link","https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=3E453C61-C65E-45D8-8CD0-6A26218B97CE","mccain.senate.gov",1214,413,232,161,6,5,1,26

Meanwhile, the United States has lacked a comprehensive strategy to meet the multifaceted threat Iran poses. The goals President Trump presented in his speech today are a welcomed long overdue change. They offer the United States a path forward that centers our policy towards Iran on its destabilizing regional ambitions rather than its nuclear program alone. I look forward to learning more about the specifics of this strategy, and the Senate Armed Services Committee will conduct thorough oversight of our military’s role in it.  Iran has routinely threatened the United States and its neighbors for decades. It is the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Its support of the murderous Assad regime has contributed to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the displacement of millions, destabilizing nations across the Middle East. Its continued development and testing of ballistic missiles flouts international law. Its rampant abuse of human rights within its own borders and around the Middle East is horrific. And it has the blood of hundreds of American soldiers on its hands from its support of anti-American terrorist groups and militias throughout the region. And yet, despite this long track record of Iranian malign activities, the Obama administration consistently treated Iran narrowly as a non-proliferation problem rather than as a geopolitical one. This legacy of failure casts a long shadow on our present situation.    I did not support the nuclear deal at the time it was proposed, and many of its specific terms will make it harder to pursue the comprehensive strategy we need. In that sense, I agree with the President that the deal is not in the vital national interests of the United States. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress on additional legislation to increase sanctions and other pressure to hold Iran accountable for its broader destructive behavior in the region.

These clashes are also emblematic of a broader, more troubling reality: Beyond our tactical successes in the fight against the Islamic State, the United States is still dangerously lacking a comprehensive strategy toward the rest of the Middle East in all of its complexity.  This is the unfortunate legacy that the Obama administration left for its successor.   If we keep sleepwalking on our current trajectory, we could wake up in the near future and find that American influence has been pushed out of one of the most important parts of the world. That is why Americans need to care about what is going on in the Middle East right now. That is why we need to stick with our true friends, like the Kurds.

I was once one of them. Six decades ago – in the age of sail – I was an undistinguished member of the Class of 1958. My superiors didn’t hold me in very high esteem in those days. Their disapproval was measured in the hundreds of miles of extra duty I marched in my time here. To be honest, I wasn’t too thrilled to be here back then, and I was as relieved to graduate – fifth from the bottom of my class – as the Naval Academy was to see me go.    I wasn’t the first or last midshipman to have had a complicated relationship with this place. But I realized a little later in life that I had underestimated the effectiveness of my education here. I hadn’t fully appreciated all that the Academy was trying to teach me until much later in life. Lessons about sacrificing for something more important than yourself. Lessons about courage and humility. About friendship. About the meaning and responsibilities of honor.  My appreciation for those lessons and for the friendships I made here bring me back often. So does my gratitude for the life of adventure the Naval Academy prepared me for, and for the privilege of being a bit player in the story of America that the Navy made possible.","link","https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=speeches&id=44FDA6A0-E3FB-444A-B6C8-F215F8288762","mccain.senate.gov",2472,501,254,425,11,9,8,74

Building upon the retaking of Mosul in July, U.S. coalition partners have liberated ISIS’s former capital of Raqqa in Syria, the pocket of Hawija in northern Iraq, and, just days ago, the border town of Al-Qaim in western Iraq. The so-called caliphate that terrorists claimed would overrun the Middle East is now a shadow of its former self—a shrinking swathe on a map once defined by an open reign of terror.     Unfortunately, however, our challenges in the region remain daunting despite these hard-fought tactical victories. Our relentless focus on destroying ISIS has obscured a troubling reality: the United States lacks a clear, comprehensive strategy that addresses the Middle East in all of its complexity.            This is part of the unfortunate legacy that the Obama Administration left for its successor. But nearly one year into the Trump Administration, we lack clarity on essential questions about our nation’s role. Our elected leaders must articulate a comprehensive strategy that reflects these judgments with specificity and detail rather than piecemeal offerings and tactical victories. Congress, with our constitutional role as a co-equal branch of government, and more importantly, the American people deserve no less.","video","https://www.facebook.com/johnmccain/videos/10155905712973707/",NA,1357,873,136,123,11,7,8,84

In addition, the President himself has endorsed a defense budget at this level.   Through the National Defense Authorization Act, we believe that Congress has done its due diligence to authorize the appropriate level of funding based on threats, requirements, and missions. This was done following months of deliberative bipartisan oversight, hearings, and negotiations. We expect that any budget agreement will reflect the hard work that Congress has just completed and the reality of today’s dangerous world. We cannot ignore the warnings of Secretary Mattis and our uniformed commanders. This era of forcing our troops to do more with less must come to end. We call on the negotiators to meet Congress’s constitutional obligation to give our troops the resources they need.

He was one of Russia’s earliest and most passionate economic and political reformers, and he never stopped believing that Russia could transform from a communist dictatorship to a thriving democracy. He served in multiple government positions, but ultimately, he came to lead Russia’s beleaguered opposition and served as a powerful advocate for the rights and freedoms of Russia’s citizens throughout the world.  After his brutal murder in the shadow of the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin is trying to bury even the memory of Boris Nemtsov. Boris symbolizes a more democratic, more prosperous, and more vibrant Russia – a country that respects the rights of its citizens and is at peace with itself and its neighbors.
