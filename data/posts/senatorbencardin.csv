And I've read through many of his rulings and public statements.  Combined, I found an extensive legal record that is peppered with examples of putting corporate interests before working Americans, showing hostility to agency decisions that protect our environment, disregard for women's health, marginalizing students with disabilities, and many more troubling decisions.   Further, despite his protestations, Judge Gorsuch's record points to a jurist who has not separated his political views from his legal views. I also do not believe that he would serve as an independent check on this president, who has tested the limits of the Constitution and the separation of powers in a way that no other modern president has done.   Judge Merrick Garland, who was never even given a hearing, was considered by almost all independent judicial scholars to be mainstream. Judge Gorsuch does not enjoy a similar evaluation.

That's the question before us all as President Trump prepares to host Chinese President Xi Jinping at his private club in Florida this week.   Trump has made a number of abrupt policy changes toward China lately. In February, he suddenly switched his stance on the key issue of Taiwan’s status — in favor of China’s preferred policy.  When asked about the switch, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that when Trump negotiates, ""the president always gets something.""  The problem is that while it is clear China got something, the administration has refused to tell us what the United States got in return.   The American people deserve to know whether President Trump's and his children's many lucrative businesses are the beneficiaries.  The American people have a right to know whether the president's decision-making is being conducted in their public interest or in his private financial interest.

I've listened closely to his testimony. And everything I've learned about him clearly indicates that he holds deeply conservative, extreme political opinions that he's unable to separate from his judicial opinions. His past rulings have restricted or eliminated rights for the disabled, for workers, for women, for countless Americans.   Further, after the unprecedented obstruction of Judge Merrick Garland - recall that Republicans refused to even meet with him or hold a hearing - I would have expected GOP leaders to consult with their colleagues on this nomination, to ensure a comparably mainstream candidate was chosen.   They did not. They blocked Judge Garland for a record 10 months, then blocked input from Democrats or Independents on who will ultimately fill the vacancy.   For these reasons and more, I'm supporting the filibuster - which exists to force compromise. I hold out hope that Republicans will hear our filibuster and compromise, as was intended.

NOAA is accepting comments on this policy change right now.  The oil companies seeking these permits require NOAA's approval because this kind of seismic activity is known to disturb marine life. What's more, this seismic probing would span the whole Eastern seaboard from Florida to Delaware – including the waters that border and feed into our own Chesapeake Bay.  This represents the first step toward opening Atlantic Coast federal waters to offshore drilling. It also represents a grave threat to our coast, our environment, and the countless families whose lives and livelihoods rely on a healthy Bay.   Let's be clear: this first step toward drilling off our coast has nothing to do with a greater need for oil. America is already the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Further, oil companies already have 24 million acres of offshore public land at their disposal.   Instead, this move toward Atlantic coast drilling puts every community along the Chesapeake Bay at risk. Seismic probing for oil threatens to disturb critical wildlife, and with it, the livelihoods of farmers and fishermen, along with all those working in the tourism and seafood industries. Remember: the Deepwater Horizon disaster utterly decimated more than 1,100 miles of coastline and did so without respect for federal versus state boundaries. The risk for another incident of this nature simply outweighs any small, potential benefits.   These past few months, the single-most common question I have received is, ""What can I do? How can I help?""  If you agree that seismic probing for oil off Maryland's coast is dangerous and unnecessary, the answer is simple: leave a comment with NOAA.

When Democrats reformed healthcare with the Affordable Care Act in 2009, we held countless hearings, heard from hundreds of experts in the field, and held open, public debate for 80 days.   Our healthcare system still needs serious work. But when we tackled it, we did so head-on and openly.   By comparison? Senate Republicans' plan is to give us little more than 20 hours' notice before upending the American healthcare system. Their secrecy and refusal to hold hearings - or even release their plans to the public - is creating tremendous uncertainty in the healthcare market already.   And while they won't tell us what's in their bill, they have said it would be based largely off the House's bill that passed in May.

Let's not mince words: it's shameful. Plain and simple. And it's even worse than the House plan that passed in May.   This bill gets rid of protections for people with pre-existing conditions by letting states opt out of them. (And, by the way, being pregnant can count as a pre-existing condition.)  It implements both annual and lifetime caps on coverage, meaning truly sick Americans - like those with cancer - can and will have their coverage suddenly end once their caps are hit.  It guts Medicaid. That's tragic for many, but especially for children, who account for 1 in 3 Medicaid enrollees.   It eliminates ""essential health benefits,"" so insurers will be able to pick and choose whether to cover basic things like child birth.   It eliminates coverage for those with mental health disorders.  And it gives a massive tax break to the very wealthy -- nearly $1 trillion.   It's time we call a spade a spade: Republicans' new healthcare bill is a tax cut for the wealthiest at the expense working class and middle class families. Period.  The text of the bill is below.

No. Completely unacceptable.   President Trump has indicated it would just ""be easier"" to gut the ACA of its funding and let our health care system fail.

Clearly written with little thought of the human consequences, this latest action by the Trump Administration will harm our economic and national security.

Families should not be ripped apart to abide by irrelevant political rhetoric.

An overwhelming majority of the scientific community tells us climate change is real and the Department of Defense has acknowledged the security risk that climate change creates for the United States.

Every community, every family, both needs and deserves clean, safe water.  For 45 years, the Clean Water Act has protected our drinking water, our wetlands that filters pollutants, our communities from floods, and provided habitat for wildlife in Maryland and throughout the nation. The Clean Water Act has been an unequivocal success.  Prior to the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, the United States was in a state of crisis similar to what the world’s developing countries face today. The Chesapeake Bay was deemed to have one of the world’s first marine dead zones, high levels of PCBs were being discovered in the San Francisco Bay, and unfettered industrial pollution had rendered a majority of waters across the U.S. and unsafe for fishing and swimming. The immense scope of the tragedies in our nation’s waters was too great for Congress to ignore.  In 1972, Congress took decisive action to address this growing threat, and that response brought about the Clean Water Act.  Why was the Clean Water Act so essential? Clean water upstream means clean water downstream. Streams and wetlands filter pollution, reduce flooding, and give fish and wildlife a place to live—and provide our nation’s great hunting and fishing areas. Farmers depend on clean water for irrigation, crops and livestock. Tourism, hunting and fishing, manufacturing, the construction industry, the food and beverage industry, the healthcare industry, the oil and gas and nuclear industries, the textiles industry, and the logging industry—all are highly dependent on clean water. The Clean Water Act also provides for critical habitat for endangered species: one third of all endangered species live only in wetlands.  The Clean Water Act provides a framework for the state and federal partnership to clean up the Chesapeake Bay. Our investment in the watershed region is paying off—Maryland’s portion of the Bay was dead-zone free in early July.   We need more protection for our water not less. President Trump’s recent repeal of the Clean Water Rule puts that in serious jeopardy. The move is blatantly partisan and can best be described as a shortsighted and dangerous gift to polluters. Despite President Trump’s attacks, I will continue to fight for America’s right to clean water.","status",NA,NA,425,62,61,35,1,2,1,10

After months of injecting uncertainty into the markets with threats to end cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments, President Trump finally announced this month that he will indefinitely halt the payments. These payments are not a bailout for insurers, but are subsidies to help lower out-of-pocket expenses.  Insurers in Maryland responded to President Trump's decision by refiling their 2018 premium rates to account for the unpaid subsidies.  As a result, the Maryland Insurance Administration just approved a rate increase of 58.2 percent for CareFirst HMO Silver plans and a rate increase of 76 percent for CareFirst PPO Silver plans. Kaiser Permanente was granted a 43.4 percent increase for its HMO Silver plans.   In sum: CSR payments offset $100 million of costs for 2018, which will now be passed on to consumers. (These secondary hikes affect Silver plans on the individual market only. There are no premium hikes for other metal level plans sold on the individual market.)  In effect, President Trump's decision to cut off CSR payments more than TRIPLED the necessary rate increases.   President Trump promised to lower health care costs, but every action he has taken while in office has raised the price of health coverage exponentially for millions of Americans who were -- and are -- depending on us to deliver affordable care.

Millions of them battle chronic conditions.  Funding CHIP should not be controversial. It should not be political. It should be a moral duty.  #CHIP has long received bipartisan support, because members of both parties have always understood that millions of children will suffer without it. But this year, it's been an uphill battle. This year, it's being used as a bargaining tool for Republicans' agenda.   Enough is enough. CHIP must be fully funded. Now. We should all, both Democrats and Republicans, be working tirelessly to ensure that it is. We should all be able to agree that children – all children – deserve health care.","link","https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/12/12/569953391/parents-worry-congress-wont-fund-the-childrens-health-insurance-program?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&utm_content=2041","npr.org",241,128,90,9,2,7,80,74
