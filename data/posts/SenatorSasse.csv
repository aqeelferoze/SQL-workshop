No cable news will give it headlines. Pundits won't be gathering to scream about it, and partisans aren't going to score the bill. It is a straightforward bill with a straightforward purpose, to ensure that the Government Accountability Office can tap into the data at the Department of Health and Human Services. But in this case looks can be deceiving. The GAO Oversight and Access Act of 2017, which I introduced together with Senator Tester a year ago, represents a significant victory for taxpayers.  Congress is flying blind when it comes to overseeing huge portions of our budget and therefore we don't have the information we need to fix our budget problems. Because of an anomaly in the law, Congress has been blocked from getting the best information available on how means-tested entitlement programs - the largest chunk of the federal budget - are working or not working.   What do I mean by that? For years the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has been trying to gain access to the database at the Department of Health and Human Services called the National Directory of New Hires. It was created in 1996 to help enforce child support payments and in order to do that it collected basic information - basically, who has a job, where do they work, and how much do they make?   GAO's interest in this data should be pretty obvious. If it can compare the information in the database to the means-tested program, it could easily spot fraud, waste, and mismanagement. If a program's rules say that to qualify for benefits a person needs to earn less than a certain amount annually, GAO could see if the program is operating as designed and issue reports to Congress. This is exactly the kind of thing that GAO does across all other federal programs. Only in this case, HHS has blocked GAO from accessing the data.   These are the biggest categories of spending. The place that GAO has not been able to do its work is in the places that we have spent the most money. It is classic Washington: bureaucracy blocking oversight for taxpayers. It is it not always malicious, but this is definitely wrong.  It is Congress' job to write the laws and it is the President's job to faithfully execute the laws. Good oversight gives Congress the information we need to do our job and to ensure that the executive agencies are doing theirs. It is therefore encouraging that tonight even though a new administration will begin in three days that Congress has asserted its right to oversight with a big bipartisan vote: 99-0.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSasse/videos/1153463871418223/",NA,363,40,83,18,0,0,0,6

He has to be accountable to someone—therefore Trump should fire him to preserve our Constitution’s separation of powers.

You read the signs, you hear the chants, you listen to the prayers and the stories and you realize that this is a March and a movement that is so much bigger than the bicep, or the gun, or the assertion of raw power.  The prolife movement isn’t just about legislative activism: it’s about persuasion and persuasion means speaking with civility and compassion. This is a movement dedicated to speaking the truth in love to care for babies and their moms.

When you look at his opinions, as I've started doing over the last few weeks when he was one of the finalists, it's really hard to figure out his policy and political preferences on any issue. He's a judge's judge who believes in three separate branches of government: Congress writes laws, the president administers them, and a judge's job is to protect our rights.

Every year since 1896, the Senate has observed Washington's Birthday by selecting one of its members, alternating parties, to read President George Washington's Farewell Address in legislative session. The Senate tradition began on February 22, 1862, as a morale-boosting gesture during the darkest days of the Civil War.    The text was once taught in every classroom across the land as a model of citizenship - and let's hope that one day it is again.   Too often we recall him primarily as General Washington or as President Washington when the real glory of this exemplary speech and moment is Citizen Washington, as he hands back power yet again, as he did earlier when he resigned his commission at the end of the Revolution.   He wanted to return to Mount Vernon, to private life, to family and to local production for neighbors. Every American should again remember that government is not the center of life; rather government is but a means to enable the real centers of life to thrive.   There are many rich lessons in this (small-r) republican text: the dangers of factionalism, the necessity of religious and ethical beliefs in the oaths we take, the dangers of debt and excessive spending, the value of trade, the importance of the actual text of the Constitution, the blessing of a defined amendment process, and so on.   May we study together these virtues of self-government again.   P.S. The over/under betting on how many words I'd mispronounce was 13 in my home...and I plan to tell my wife she won.

On the other hand, if it was with a legal FISA Court order, then an application for surveillance exists that the Court found credible.

Why? Because the problem with this regulation is actually much more basic than all of the substantive problems in the regulation.   This regulation actually makes the assumption that bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. are competent to micromanage teacher training programs in America. That's absurd.  My dad was a teacher. My wife was a teacher. I was a college president at a university that had multiple teacher training programs - and yet, I wouldn't possibly think that I am ready to decree all the details inside those programs from thousands and thousands of miles away.   So instead of my prepared remarks, I brought the 695 pages of this regulation down to the Senate floor and asked my colleagues these three questions:  QUESTION 1: Do you really think that bureaucrats in this city know better how to run teacher training programs than people who've spent most of their lives inside actual classrooms with actual future teachers and with students?  QUESTION 2: Has anyone actually read this regulation that folks are going to say they want to defend on this floor?  QUESTION 3: Can those who think that this is what Washington, D.C., ought to be doing right now please show me somewhere in the Constitution where we are given the specific authority to micromanage local programs like this from here?  Now, a couple of qualifications are in order. Am I suggesting that all teacher training programs in America work well? Heavens no. There are some that are fairly strong, and there are actually a lot that are really, really poor and weak. But having a good intention to make them better is not the same as actually having accomplished something that will make them better. Good intentions are not enough. Because we have compulsory governmental powers, we would need not merely good intentions, we would also need competence and authority for us in this body to act. Does anyone sincerely believe that the big, pressing problem in American education is that there aren't enough rules like this coming out of bureaucracies in Washington, D.C.?  Watch the full speech to get more of the details of the substantive problems with this regulation, but here's the big takeaway: Federal intervention and reforms should never make problems worse, but that is what this rule would do. No federal bureaucracy is competent to displace the expertise of the district and the state level, and we should not be trying to regulate teacher training programs from Washington, D.C.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSasse/videos/1197817953649481/",NA,432,78,128,50,2,2,2,8

In 1846, an explorer described the state as a “barren, trackless waste...” That changed with the Homestead Act.  The Homestead Act made made land ownership accessible to anyone, from married men to divorced or widowed women, former slaves, and even immigrants. People of totally different backgrounds and means could legally own 160 acres of American land.  Of course, there was a catch.  The Homestead Act gave settlers property deeds only after they worked and lived on the land for five years. Your background didn’t matter. Your care of the land, did.  Homesteaders struggled through droughts, blizzards, floods, and plagues. Many didn’t last five years. The ones who did, cultivated the land and grew relationships with their neighbors. By 1900, almost 69,000 people had claimed land in Nebraska under the Homestead Act, the largest number of any state in the Union.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSasse/videos/1200637383367538/",NA,140,35,23,7,1,0,0,0

It’s a strange thing that judges wear robes. But instead of looking past this strange convention, let’s look right at it. For it isn’t just some relic from the past. It isn’t just something people wore long ago in a forgotten era of formality, like a powdered wig.   So why do the robes – often unfashionable and unflattering – persist? The reasons were summed up better than I could put it by one sitting judge. He said:  “[D]onning a robe doesn’t make me any smarter. But the robe does mean something – and not just that I can hide coffee stains on my shirt. It serves as a reminder of what’s expected of us – what Burke called the ‘cold neutrality of an impartial judge.’ It serves, too, as a reminder of the relatively modest station we’re meant to occupy in a democratic society. In other places, judges wear scarlet.... Here, we’re told to buy our own plain black robes – and I can attest the standard choir outfit at the local uniform supply store is a good deal. Ours is a judiciary of honest black polyester.”  The author of these insightful words was Judge Neil Gorsuch. And that statement is an excellent lens through which to frame the work of this Committee this week – and indeed the work of the Supreme Court for the next century and beyond.   I want to make three simple, overlapping points about the judge’s black robe:   One, it changes the way our eyes see the Court;   Two, it reiterates the duty – the calling – of a judge to the judge; and   Three, it gives us an opportunity to teach our kids about our – their – Constitution, our fundamental law, the enduring paper that defines what our government can and cannot do.   Watch the full speech to flesh out all three of these points – but here’s the big takeaway: Today, Judge Gorsuch is wearing a suit and tie. Before he can put on that black robe he must answer the committee’s questions. I expect that Mr. Gorsuch, the citizen, has policy preferences and desired outcomes. I also expect that by the end of this week it will be clear that Judge Gorsuch, the judge’s judge, will faithfully embody the spirit of that black robe.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSasse/videos/1209208602510416/",NA,429,78,205,50,4,2,0,3

The simplest way for Russia to try to weaken us is by trying to exploit the places where we are already weak and the places where we are already distrustful, the places where we are failing to pass along a shared understanding of American values to the next generation. The sad state of modern politics and the explosion of digital media are proving to be ripe targets for many of our own internal doubts and our own discord.

New jobs, friendships, and adventures lie ahead.   You’re going to hear a lot of things in your graduation speeches – fair warning they’re probably 25% bunk – but here are a few encouraging thoughts for anyone willing to roll up their sleeves and get to work:   First, saddle up. You’re entering the workforce during what’s arguably the largest economic disruption in human history. While we’ve been changing the way we eat, fight, and live since our hunter-gatherer great-grandparents, this round of development has very specific consequences for you.   Your job won’t look like your dad’s. Or your granddad’s. Your jobs – yes, jobs plural – won’t be permanent. You’re going to see whole industries transformed, landing you at a half dozen companies during your career.   Here’s the good news. While that sounds overwhelming to my generation, you are going to be ok. You and your friends are our state (and country’s) best bets at a sustainable transition to a radically different economy. There’s going to be a lot of turbulence and change. It’s not going to be easy. But you’re going to pull through – we need you to pull through – and be life-long learners.   As you prepare to graduate, I want to thank you. You’ve worked hard. But more challenges are just ahead. We need you to be creative problem solvers, pushing innovative solutions to tackle long-term problems facing our country, from social security and the entitlement crisis, to Islamic Jihadism.   Life after graduation isn’t going to be smooth or easy, but you’re going to rise to the challenge. We need you to. And honestly, we can’t wait to watch you succeed.

It’s easy to pass over this day as irrelevant, to write it off as outdated and ceremonial. But that’d be a real shame.   Flag Day is a chance to celebrate something important about our country, something bigger than political parties or issues in the news. Actor Chris Pratt posted a great video with his son a couple years ago that really brought this home for me.    In this video, Chris stands tall, recites the Pledge of Allegiance, having his son repeat the words after him. He says each line seriously, deliberately – “indivisible” is a real mouthful for a little kid. At the end, they shake hands.   I’m so struck by this picture of a dad sharing the precious inheritance of freedom with his son. It’s not an intellectual exercise, a political statement, or even a poetic tribute – it’s one man passing down something important to his child.   Chris demonstrates reverence and respect for the flag, not because he’s worshipping some piece of canvas, but because that material represents the American creed.   That’s huge. His very body language pays tribute to the American Idea that says you can disagree with policies, take offense at politicians, and protest to high heaven, but your right to your opinion, your ability to speak freely without fear of violence, is fought for and protected by the very principles represented by that flag.   My team and stand proudly for the flag today, joining the Pratt family and the thousands of other Americans who love this country and the important ideas that safeguard our freedom and liberty.   God bless America.","video","https://www.facebook.com/PrattPrattPratt/videos/981885381843291/",NA,690,79,0,103,0,1,1,3

Today, I want to tell you about one of the families we’ve been working with in Nebraska.   Mike Gerren of Omaha, Nebraska, retired in February. He started working when he was 18, and finally, at 62, he and his wife Cynthia were looking ahead to time together and with their grandkids.   There was only one problem. Because he was born in England (his military dad married his British mom while he was stationed there), the Social Security office didn’t recognize his citizenship. They refused to pay out his retirement.   Mike and Cynthia thought there must have been some mistake.    “Mike has been in this country since he was 9 months old,” Cynthia said. “He’s paid into social security. He started working when he was 18 years old.”   It turns out, despite a childhood passport, the department of immigration needed a specific form that was still outstanding. An investigation into the case could take 18 months, and more than $1,000. The only other alternative was to apply for a passport with proof of an upcoming international trip.   With no income and a lot more questions, Mike and Cynthia were overwhelmed.   “You wouldn’t believe how much they told us we needed,” Cynthia said. “I was trying to write it all down and couldn’t keep up with what they were saying…”   Paperwork included Mike’s parents’ marriage and death certificates, and even his dad’s fourth grade report card.   At this point, Cynthia called my team in Lincoln and asked for help. Our case workers started sorting through their documents — something they do with every case that hits their desks.   “The government is a big puzzle,” one team member says. “It’s hard to work through.”   After sorting documents and creating a timeline, my team turned to contacts at the passport office in Denver, Colorado, contacts who listened and offered constructive advice and help.   After a month of back and forth, we told Cynthia it was time to make the trip to Denver with their qualifying documents to get a new passport.   Mike and Cynthia walked into the office, submitted their documents, and left for lunch. His passport, and proof of citizenship, was waiting for them when they returned.   The Gerrens went to the social security office that same week – several months after Mike retired. They were so relieved.   “It was a horrible taxing ordeal,” Cynthia said. “The Sasse case work team went to bat for us – they literally saved the day.”   Cynthia and Mike finally received their social security (and pension) in May. They’re able to sit back and enjoy the retirement he worked decades for.   Federal oversight is an important part of our work here in the Senate. We’re so glad we could help the Gerrens and we want to help other Nebraskans too.   As Cynthia said: “I was fighting the government, so I had to get the government to help get through it.”   If you need help navigating a federal agency, please reach out to my team across the state. We’d love to help.   Happy retirement, Gerrens. My team and I wish you happy fishing!   Need help navigating the federal bureaucracy?

I think more violence is inevitable."" That much seems obvious. Less expected was where some of them went next. One of my constituents, a fairly energetic Trump supporter and a middle-aged man, told me: **""To be clear, I think the alt-Right are a bunch of a**holes.""‎ **""And we should admit that the President has done a bad job getting us through this."" **But ""when the next rounds of violence come, I'll bet you most of it will come from the left."" **""And then some folks I know will respond in kind. It's gonna be a powder-keg.""   My wife and I work hard to have chunks of family time that are ""politics-free"" in our home, but we haven't been very successful this week. A few observations from our family tabletalk:   1. We have neglected the American Idea for a very long time. We haven't done civics well in this country for decades, and we are reaping the consequences. We are a hollow people. We have ""a whole lot of pluribus and very little unum,"" to quote Ken Burns.   2. America is first and foremost an Idea – that all people are endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights. This universal human dignity is because God made us; it's not because of our race, or our wealth, or even our religious beliefs, as important as disagreements about theology are.    3. White supremacy and racism are un-American, period.    4. The heartbreak in Charlottesville was the fault of the ‎white supremacists. Heather Heyer was murdered by an act of terrorism. The driver used his car to target public marchers.   5.  Sadly, I think that the pessimistic Nebraskans I've been with this week are right that there will be more violence toward public assemblies in the future.   6.  I expect that violence will come when white supremacists and the alt-right fight anarchist groups aligned with the extreme left.  ‎   7.  What will happen next? I doubt that Donald Trump will be able to calm and comfort the nation in that moment. He (and lots of others) will probably tell an awful combination of partial truths and outright falsehoods. On top of the trust deficits that are already baked so deeply in, unity will be very hard to come by.    8. Besides ability and temperament, I also worry that national unity will be unlikely because there are some whispering in the President's ear that racial division could be good politics for them.    9. I worry that some on the left are also going to salivate over these divisions. Like the President's ear-whisperers, they see a divided nation as good for their political objectives.    10. Bizarrely, many on the center-left seem not to see that there is little that some on the President's team would love more than to transform this into a fight about historical monuments.    11. I wish more folks understood how many of the monuments now being debated are not really from the post-Civil War period as a way to remember war dead. Rather, contrary to popular understanding, many of these statues were explicitly erected as Segregation Monuments in the twentieth century, during Jim Crow, as a way of shouting – against the American Idea – that public spaces were to be whites-only spaces. Tragically, many of these monuments were erected exactly when lynchings of black Americans were being celebrated in those communities – and the timing overlap here was not accidental. (It's also worth noting that Gen. Robert E. Lee had opposed erecting Confederate Memorials because he worried, wisely, that they would become scabs of bitterness to be endlessly picked at.)   12. But I'm also against mobs tearing down the statues, or city governments removing them in the middle of the night. That doesn't advance the civics discussion and debates we need; it just exacerbates the unhelpful ""on both sides"" grievance culture. Rather, we need an orderly debate about such monuments.    13. Every single place I've been this week, I've gotten a question like this:  **""Washington and Jefferson owned slaves; do we have to tear down their statues too?"" **""Explorer X didn't treat native Americans the way he should have; do we abandon states west of the Appalachian Trail?"" **""Even Tom Osborne isn't a saint; must we tear down the statute outside Lincoln's Memorial Stadium?""  The people asking these questions (over and over and over) are not racist. Rather they're perplexed by the elite indifference to their fair questions – about the ""unnaming"" movement now unfolding at Yale, for example. Most of these folks voted for Trump, to be sure, but many quietly admit to being dissatisfied with his leadership. But they have ZERO uncertainty about a choice between a Trump who would defend statues of Washington and Jefferson, and a national media elite who they assume would not defend monuments to Washington and Jefferson. That's the divide many here are seeing and hearing. ‎  ‎14. The white supremacists from Charlottesville now feel emboldened. They’re headed to another city sometime soon – with the express purpose of spreading their hateful rhetoric and inciting violence. This is the most attention they've received in years.   15. Tragically, there are some who want violence. Most Americans see the images from Charlottesville and our hearts break. We yearn for leaders, who raise high the exceptional American Idea of universal human dignity. But there are others who want to see these divisions exacerbated — not only the extremists on the ground but also some cable news executives who jump at division and know that what’s bad for America is good for ratings.   16. There is so much more nuance and texture inside local communities than broad-brush national ""Crossfire""-like journalism usually distinguishes. One example from Nebraska right now: There seems to be a major gap on race issues between two types of generally Trump-supporting Republicans. Among more frequent church-goers, there is a lot more sadness and worry right now, whereas among more secular conservatives there seems to be a lot more ""let's fight."" I could be wrong, but that's been my repeated experience this week.   BEFORE THE NEXT OUTBREAK OF VIOLENCE COMES   We have a glorious heritage in the American Idea, but we have neglected it at our kids’ peril.    This is the right time for each of us – parents and grandparents, neighbors and patriots – to pause and teach our kids again about universal human dignity and about love of neighbor. This is a time for discussion and education and humility, not intimidation and mobs and midnight wrecking balls. ‎  Let’s teach our kids why our First Amendment Society fights with debate, not violence. Let’s teach them that those standing in threatening mobs don’t stand with America. Let’s teach them that white supremacy is a cancer to our union. Let’s teach them to reject identity politics. Let's teach them that all of us are created equal, with infinite dignity and limitless potential. Let’s teach them that what makes us Americans is not our skin, our wealth, or our religion but our shared creed. ‎  That creed, ironically, was put to paper most profoundly by a very fallen slave-holder, who spoke for the long-term future of America in writing that “all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights…” We eventually went to war to preserve a creedal “government of the people, by the people, for the people.” And that creed eventually perfected our union from a jail cell in Birmingham, Alabama, with the proclamation that “‎the goal of America is freedom.”    It feels like violence is coming. I'm not sure if this moment is like the summer of '67 or not. But it might be. Before that violence strikes again, it’s up to us to reaffirm that exceptional American Creed again today, with our neighbors, and in our kids' hearts.

On this day in 1814, British forces torched the Capitol Building, the Library of Congress, the Supreme Court, and burned down the Treasury Building and the White House.   Folks in Baltimore 40 miles away could see the flames.   On that day, British troops burned our buildings, but they couldn’t destroy the principles that defined our country. First Lady Dolley Madison and State Department clerk Stephen Pleasonton knew the difference.   “I have always been an advocate for fighting when assailed,” Dolley Madison wrote. Overriding people’s concerns for her to leave the city, she stayed to pack up important pieces of our nation’s history in the White House. Heck, her husband the president wasn’t even there.   When someone arrived to personally evacuate the First Lady, Dolley saw the 8-foot painting of George Washington still hanging on the wall. No way was she going to let the British capture that.   The painting was screwed into the wall, so Dolley ordered a gardener to break the frame, remove the canvas, and rush it to safety, doing whatever was necessary to avoid it falling into the hands of the British.   Only then did she leave.   Stephen, meanwhile, spent the morning filling wagons with important documents. Just before he left, he saw the Declaration of Independence still hanging on the wall.   It was just a piece of paper, but it was a paper that enshrined the principles of our young nation – the principles that proclaimed the dignity of every man and woman, and their rights that no leader could ever take away.   Stephen cut the document down from its frame. It was a bad day for frames, but a great day for America.   British troops destroyed a lot of buildings that day, but Dolley Madison and Stephen Pleasonton prevented them from destroying documents and symbols way more important and significant to our nation.   May we continue to be inspired by these patriots to keep our cool and fight for the most important things in our country no matter the fires around us.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSasse/photos/a.711063948991553.1073741828.709959352435346/1361072647324010/?type=3",NA,623,90,189,83,1,9,0,0

On that day of peaceful protest, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his “I Have a Dream” speech, a powerful vision of equal rights and racial reconciliation. His words echoed up and down the National Mall and still inspire us today.  “This is our hope,” he said. “With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.”  Back in Nebraska, the Omaha World Herald proclaimed “Feet Ache in Washington to Stir U.S. Conscience.” The Lincoln Star reported: “Big March is Orderly.”  For some folks, it was too successful. The Herald reported that the Soviet Union pulled a telecast of the march just before it was supposed to start.  ""The only explanation that fits is that the program would have reflected favorably upon the United States and its constitutionally guaranteed rights of free speech and free assembly,” the paper wrote.  In a triumph of our First Amendment society, marchers showed the world that Americans fight with words and debate, not violence.  Back home, letters to the editors flooded in in support. People of all races moved to act, from championing all Nebraskans’ right to buy and sell property, to new church groups supporting civil rights.  Today we remember the March on Washington, humbled and grateful for the folks who called on our country to uphold the freedoms in the Declaration of Independence for all Americans — Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness — and the Nebraskans who put those ideas into practice in their communities.  We follow in their footsteps, resolved to respect each others’ dignity and freedoms in our neighborhoods, schools, and places of worship. We remember Dr. King’s words and the urgency with which he spoke them:  “Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.”​","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSasse/photos/a.711063948991553.1073741828.709959352435346/1364247797006495/?type=3",NA,974,123,226,155,0,1,3,1

It’s college football Saturday across the country… and, in case you didn’t know, there is no place like Nebraska.   It’s been 247 days since the last Husker kickoff. In Nebraska, we haven't been wasting that time. We’ve worked hard. Now it’s time to play hard.   It’s FINALLY game day.   Folks who haven’t had the good grace to be brought up in Nebraska, know three things about our state:   1) We have the best corn and beef in the world (or, at least, they know we have a lot of it). 2) We’re the home of ‘The Good Life.’ 3) We bleed Husker red.   That’s because hard work and character are the foundation of our communities.   We know that they represent who and what Nebraska is all about.   We’re the breadbasket of the world; We’re a state of unending kindness, generosity, and of the friendliest one finger wave you’ll ever receive. And, on top of all of that, we’re the home of the best fans in college sports.   To win championships the right way, like Nebraska has, you have to meld knowledge, toughness, and tenacity, with a humble commitment to putting your head down and getting to work.   In short, what makes Husker football great, isn’t all that much different than what makes Nebraska great.   Nebraska is a place of grit. Our communities were founded by pioneers and homesteaders who refused to quit, and saw the potential of the land -- while others shrugged at Nebraska territory as another piece of the ‘Great American Desert.’   Our grandparents and great-grandparents were people who rolled their sleeves up next to strangers and created tight-knit communities while working the land.   In college football or in life, these traits are what makes Nebraska a glorious place.   Football seasons, both good and bad, have to start somewhere – and today is the start of another season.   As Husker fans, we’ve watched our season openers lead us to season ending Gatorade showers for Coach Osborne, as the Nebraska Dynasty of the ‘90s high-stepped into history.  We’ve also watched our teams leave it all on the field, and fall shy of glory, like in 1983 when we lost the National Championship by just a point. ONE point. By the way, it takes a real man to go for two.   This year, glory or not, Nebraska fans will continue the longest consecutive sellout streak in college football history -- a streak of pride that began all the way back in November of 1962. The next closest college team is almost 10 years behind.    So today, as Nebraskans join the rest of the country in digging out our wrinkled jerseys, reinventing our superstitions to make this THE year, and stuffing ourselves with cream cheese monstrosities, we know we’re not like any other college football fans. Here is our creed:   -Memorial Stadium is home to the best fans in college sports. -And, whether we’re talking about the vast farm fields across Nebraska or the turf of Tom Osborne field… there is still no place like Nebraska. #GBR","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSasse/videos/1367950926636182/",NA,399,59,100,60,1,1,2,1

They are champion parents to begin with, but Matt and Mandy are also adoption heroes.    That’s why they’re in D.C. — my team and I nominated Matt and Mandy as Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute's Angel in Adoption.     Back in 2010, Matt and Mandy adopted three middle-school-aged kids, siblings. The two girls and a boy had been separated from their biological mom.    ""We moved around a lot, so it was hard for us to think we might stay somewhere,” the oldest, Lydia said.    That all changed when Matt, Senior Pastor of Northern Heights Baptist Norfolk, and his wife Mandy, invited them into their family.   Matt, Mandy, and their four biological kids—Jenna, Savannah, Emma, and Micah—didn’t plan to adopt. But when the opportunity found them, they jumped in: whole heart, whole family.   They’ll tell you it took a little while to adjust. Lydia, Isabella, and Josh got to know the Gilmores through church and weekend visits.    But over time, they bonded and became a family. Lydia said she finally didn’t have to worry about finding enough food for her siblings. She could be a kid, could focus on school and fun.    Seven years later, the Gilmores are going from strength to strength. The kids are homeschooled. They work together in their large garden and sell produce at a roadside stand. And there are always games and puzzles at home.   Oh, and last year, they added another sibling, adopting one-year-old Ella.   Like all parents, Matt and Mandy grapple with loving and caring for their kids. Their super-sized family has unique challenges, though - challenges Matt and Mandy and all their kids courageously and selflessly tackle each day. Thanks for your passion, Gilmores.

I'm referring specifically to the smear campaign of the A.B.A against Steve Grasz, a qualified public servant from Nebraska who has been nominated by the president to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.    The ABA’s rating of him as “not qualified” is advocacy disguised as objective analysis. Mr. Grasz is in fact eminently qualified for the circuit court bench, as has been testified to by Republicans and Democrats across our state.   So what is so extreme about Steve Grasz? Well, in the 1990s when Nebraska first outlawed the partial-birth abortion procedure, many pro-abortion advocates brought suit, and Steve, as Chief Deputy Attorney General of Nebraska, defended the law of our state. He defended that law because it was his job. He defended the law because that's what the people of Nebraska wanted when they passed a law saying that this unspeakably barbaric procedure had no place in our state. And now, thanks to federal law, has no place in our nation. Anyone who would paint Steve as an extremist needs to take a long, hard, and honest look at what he did as Chief Deputy Attorney General of Nebraska defending the laws of the state of Nebraska.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSasse/videos/1420467118051229/",NA,580,249,113,64,7,10,8,122

Our gratitude and care for those who fight for us doesn’t stop when they come home.   One of those groups is the Wounded Warriors Writing Workshop, with chapters in Lincoln, Omaha, and Grand Island.   Warrior Writing Workshops are free, semester-long writing classes for servicemen and women.   In Lincoln, the Saturday sessions are organized around UNL football. On off weeks, veterans, their families, and writing instructors meet in the VA auditorium for two hours for guest lectures, writing exercises, and time to share their own work in small groups.   Volunteer leaders of the Lincoln chapter Tom Seib and Sara Hollcroft say that the workshops are more than writing classes.   Sara says: “We hope everyone who attends leaves knowing that there are people who are willing to listen – and care enough — to listen.”   One workshop regular is Vietnam veteran Dean Hyde, a retired lieutenant colonel, who served in the Army. He’s seen first-hand how the writing workshop has helped veterans.   “One gentleman in the group here has said he’s seen a lot more death and carnage than probably the rest of us will ever see,” he says. “Being in this writer’s group has helped him deal with some of that.”   Dean’s working on a full-length written history of his service and even created a Power Point presentation about his time in Vietnam during the war. He’s using writing to share his experience with others, including high school kids who don’t know much about war outside the movies.    In fact, that’s a gift Warrior Writers give us all. As many Americans become further removed from war, we are grateful to the men and women who share their stories with us. You help us understand the cost of freedom and the price of bravery.    Thank you, Dean, for your service, and Sara, Tom, and the rest of the Warrior Writing Team for your work. It inspires us to listen better to the heroes who defend us.   Warrior Writers Lincoln will meet Nov 18, from 9 – 11 a.m. in the Auditorium of the VA Hospital on 70th and 0 Street.

Today we’re highlighting one way we can help servicemen and women with military casework by tracking down service medals from the National Personnel Record Center.    I first met Vietnam veteran Colin Andrews on an honor flight in May. He and his uncle flew to Washington, D.C. as part of the Spring Honor Flight to tour the capital.   When he returned, he contacted my office. He had questions about a few issues, and he asked if we could help track down his service medals.   “When you start having grandchildren you want to be able to share those things with them and pass them along,” Colin says. “When I was part of the Honor Flight, it brought back that it would be nice to have all of them.”   Colin had some paperwork from his time in Vietnam but no medals. He started online, going through suggested channels, but all he got was another copy of his discharge papers in the mail.   “I was very frustrated — I could never quite figure out how to get them ordered,” he said.   So he approached us.    My team contacted folks in the National Personnel Record Center to confirm Colin’s paperwork and process his requests. A few weeks later, six medals arrived in our office, Colin’s Vietnam War combat service medals and the Army commendation medal. In fact, I got to present them to him in a ceremony with his family.   It was a special day.   Colin’s grandchildren are still small —one is turning 21 months and the other is just 5 weeks old.   “It’ll be a little bit before I can show them the medals,” Colin says, laughing. “But it was just important to have them for when that time comes.”   We’re so glad we could help Colin track down his medals. Thank you, Colin for your service to our country.   If you or someone else you know is having trouble navigating Veteran’s Affairs or the National Personnel Record Center, please let us know.

The ABA is a liberal organization that has publicly advocated for left-of-center positions. It’s pretty simple: if you’re playing the game, you can’t cherry-pick the referees.   Take for just a moment the amicus briefs they’ve filed in recent years:   - In District of Columbia v. Heller, the ABA supported denying an individual their constitutional right to keep and bear arms.  - In Christian Legal Society v. Martinez, the ABA supported forcing Christian organizations on campuses to accept members that reject their faith.   - In Medellin v. Texas, the ABA supported forcing states to recognize the judgments of the World Court in order to stop the execution of a gruesome murderer.  - In United States v. Windsor, the ABA supported the recognition of same-sex marriage through judicial fiat instead of legislative debate.  - In Arizona v. United States, the ABA supported a constitutional ban on state and local law enforcement assisting in enforcing federal immigration law.    In each of these cases, the ABA decided to wade into divisive and contentious issues. In each of these cases, the ABA took what can only be described as a left of center position. In each of these cases, the ABA picked a side.  To be clear, they’re allowed to do that – it’s what makes this country great. But it’s laughably naïve to suggest that they’re objective.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSasse/videos/1432918196806121/",NA,466,285,82,25,10,8,7,129

No really, on Nov. 18, 1883, some folks saw the twelve o’clock hour come and go not once, but twice.   It wasn’t an-interplanetary phenomena, but the creation of Standard Time that caused this miracle, a creation we’re celebrating today.   With one spin of clock hands across the nation, railroads put into effect national time zones, revolutionized inter-state commerce, and measured time in a way that still affects us today.   On Sunday, November 18, 1883 our country went from hundreds of local time zones to four. In a span of a few hours, we drastically simplified the way people measured and related to each other across the country.   Before that, towns relied on “sun” time, using High Noon as reference. People looked for the point where the sun was highest in the sky, marked it as noon, and counted the rest of the day from there.   The result was hundreds of local times with multiple time zones inside the same state. It was especially confusing for folks who traveled between towns and cities, especially on the railroad. “Your 11:30 or ours? 11:30 your time or 11:55 mine?”   As trains got faster, travel time got shorter, and trains covered thousands of miles and dozens of time zones across the continental U.S. Railroad stations in big cities had multiple departure and arrival times for the same train as they tried to accommodate dozens of time zones. Just crazy.   But no one had a solution — the local, state, and federal governments weren’t doing anything about it.   So, people in business, in the railroad industry, championed the adoption of standard time, where the time would stay constant within certain geographic regions. Even better, they proposed a relatively painless way for cities, towns, and villages to make small changes to sync to the new standard time.    So today marks the day that we started implementing those new time zones. Some towns put their clocks back 4 minutes, others put them forward 30 minutes. It became known as the Day of Two Noons, because some places ended up with two lunch hours when all was said and done.   The Day of Two Noons shows how businesses can drive national innovation. Railroad companies saw the mess resulting in hyper-localized time-telling and created a better system and implementation plan for the rest of the country. It wasn’t that time actually changed — the sun still shone for a certain part of the day and the moon for another. But the way we measured time, the way we regularized it, evened out time zones and time changes, is a change in perspective we still benefit from today.   Even after the railroads implemented Standard Time, and the trains ran more smoothly and folks knew what to expect, the government still dragged its feet, refusing to fully implement Standard Time until 1918. Some towns went half and half for years, one section following standard time, the other part, local time.    But ultimately, innovation and problem-solving won over even the big wigs and bureaucrats in Washington.   No matter what time zone you’re in, may the spirit of innovation and problem-solving that brought us the Day of Two Noons be found in you and me, today.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSasse/videos/1433703843394223/",NA,348,67,115,16,1,10,0,2

Desperately sick and facing a country tired and divided in the midst of Civil War, Abraham Lincoln stood to deliver the Gettysburg Address, an ode to democracy, which echoes through our country still today.   “Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,” he began, the crowd bursting into applause to interrupt him.   He spoke on a battlefield, a graveyard for a battle that cost our young country 51,000 lives.    Lincoln honored the dead and inspired the living.   “It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”   Today we remember his words — we hear his call to hold fast to our country’s founding, our heritage, and core beliefs in the dignity and equality of all men, as well his rallying cry to unite to protect those founding beliefs and freedom even in the midst of disagreement and fatigue. Those words are as timeless as they are true.     May “that government of the people, by the people, for the people … never perish from the earth.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSasse/photos/a.711063948991553.1073741828.709959352435346/1433803253384282/?type=3",NA,900,147,238,127,0,7,1,3

This incredible transportation story changed the course of a major Revolutionary War battle.   Ok – to clarify, no railroads were involved in this train. Instead, on this day in 1775, Henry Knox started transporting 119,000 pounds of artillery from upstate New York to Massachusetts, by boat, horse, and ox sled, through frozen lakes and snow storms.   Eight months into the Revolutionary War, we were holed up in Boston, under siege by the British army.  Outgunned, outmanned, we were at a stalemate, holding on by sheer scrap and willpower.   Henry Knox, bookseller in peace, military strategist in war, knew just what American forces needed: the 59 cannons and other artillery American forces had seized from the English. That’s right: we had a plan to turn stolen British guns on the redcoats. The only problem was that they were 300 miles away, at Fort Ticonderoga.   In a feat of logistics, Knox dismantled and transported that artillery to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Did I mention roads were basically non-existent? And that it was the middle of winter?   But Henry Knox was undaunted & determined.   When General Washington sent Knox up to Fort Ticonderoga with £1000 and instructions to spare no expense, Knox thought his mission would take 2 weeks. He was wrong.   “It is not easy [to] conceive the difficulties we have had in getting them over the Lake owing to the advanc’d Season of the Year & contrary winds,” he wrote Washington, “but the danger is now past & three days ago it was very uncertain whether we could have gotten them untill next spring, but now please God they must go…”   It took Knox and his crew 56 days. They crossed treacherous lakes, barren countryside, and half-frozen rivers to pull up outside Boston on January 25.   But then victory was swift and sure; thanks to the Noble Train of Artillery, we overwhelmed British forces, ending an 11-month occupation in two days.   The Revolutionary War would last another 7 years, but Henry Knox & the Noble Train of Artillery demonstrated the out-of-the-box innovation, problem-solving, and perseverance that helped us win the war and found a nation.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSasse/videos/1450222305075710/",NA,446,208,112,49,5,7,3,29

They were orphans and outcasts of different races and religious backgrounds.    Those differences didn’t matter in Father Flanagan’s Home for Boys.   “To me, they are all God’s children,” Flanagan said. “I must protect them to the best of my ability.”   By Spring, he was taking care of 100 boys. He ran the house from donation to donation, teaching the boys academics and trades, and focused on providing a loving place for them to heal as well as learn skills for productive lives and healthy families. Nebraskans sent in money, farmers donated food, and local women volunteered to help cook and clean. Everyday Nebraskans pitched in to help.   Father Flanagan’s Home for Boys was never just a children’s shelter.

All told, through its programs, research hospital, and direct youth care services around the country, Boys Town serves more than 15,000 kids each year, one of America’s biggest child and family service organizations.   Today, we’re grateful for Father Flanagan, a man with heart and a vision to turn orphans and the homeless into a family. A man who saw hope and possibility where other people just saw trouble. A man who saw the desolate and outcast as God’s precious children. That’s a spirit of hope and transformation we’re proud to claim in this state.

Spoiler alert: it was pretty bleak.  We’re talking about the winter of 1777, when General George Washington led the Continental Army into a winter encampment at Valley Forge.    The backdrop for this Christmas encampment: the Revolutionary War was looking worse & worse for American forces. Two and a half years into fighting, the British had occupied what was then the capital—Philadelphia. Washington faced a skeptical Congress who was long on criticism and short on cash.  Amidst blustery winds and freezing cold, they built a village of huts at Valley Forge (legend has it that Washington himself slept in a canvas tent until the last of the soldiers was in winter housing). He hoped it would be a place for them to regain their strength to win with “one heart” and “one mind.”  Needless to say, they ran into some complications. Like, the lack of food.  Congress was funding the army from money scraped together from state’s voluntary offerings. That money didn’t cover winter clothing, or Christmas rations (we’re talking meal plans of rice and vinegar).  “We have experienced little less than a famine in camp,” Washington wrote to Patrick Henry.  But if conditions were harsh, then the army’s resilience was even more moving.  Washington’s letters are full of awe and admiration, of men leaving bloody footprints in the snow. Although he estimated a third of the force had no shoes, these soldiers displayed “patience & obedience which in my opinion can scarce be paralel’d.”  He was a grateful leader, a general overwhelmed by the task ahead, but also by the dignity of the men in his charge.  It would be six months before the Continental Army marched away from Valley Forge—but they did not give up, did not despair. And their leader didn’t leave them.  So this week, enjoy all the benefits and privileges of freedom—fleece blankets & fuzzy slippers included. But don’t forget the folks who paid for our comfort and freedom. And the general who, by sheer force of will, gave troops who had no shoes the hope and strength to persevere.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSasse/videos/1463475673750373/",NA,645,331,238,97,1,3,4,55

It all started in December 1891, when the cold Massachusetts temperature drove guys inside. James Naismith saw how restless they were.  They missed their usual outdoor sports. And indoor-baseball was never going to take off.   The director of the Springfield Young Men’s Christian Association tapped Naismith to create a new indoor sport, an “athletic distraction” to help the guys make it through winter. It had to “be interesting, easy to learn, and easy to play in the winter and by artificial light.” And it needed to be more strategic than forceful - no broken bones.  Naismith studied rugby, baseball, lacrosse, and soccer, thinking about ways to adapt the best parts of each sport to a small gym. He ended up with two peach baskets and a soccer ball. He nailed the baskets 10 feet up, wrote 13 rules, and launched a basketball league.    The first game, nine-on-nine, launched on this day, December 21, in 1891. It had two 15-minute halves and ended with a score of 9-3.   The game spread quickly. Dribbling was added. YMCA leagues formed around the country. In 1901, colleges added basketball to their sponsored sports. Eventually, holes got cut in the bottom of baskets so the ball would drop through automatically. And the number of players on the court dropped to 5.  Less than 40 years after its invention, the sport they called “basketball” became an Olympic sport.   A few thoughts:   First — Naismith’s attempt was the third in the history of the YMCA challenge to create a winter sport. Unlike the guys who came before him, Naismith wanted to create a sport that felt like play, that was strategic and fun. I love that joy and curiosity.  Second — Naismith wasn’t an athlete first and foremost. He had deep pastoral roots and a degree in theology. This guy created a sport out of a desire to serve students, not to make millions.   So the next time you catch a basketball game, think about James Naismith and his heart for service. What would it look like for us to see the challenges in our community as an opportunity for innovation and creativity as well?","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSasse/videos/1465153383582602/",NA,393,165,104,37,3,3,0,33

After two decades farming and working in public school education, Brian and Dee Falk went to Taiwan in 2000 to work in an international school as missionaries.  “It’s the hardest job I’ve ever loved,” Dee says.  They raised their daughter overseas and celebrated her marriage to a Taiwanese man.  The only issue was Dee’s grandchildren couldn’t qualify for automatic American citizenship because her daughter had lived abroad for so long.  In 2013, when Brian and Dee’s grandson was born, they used a legal option to apply for citizenship through their status as grandparents. It took 3 months to process. So when their granddaughter, Rylee, was born last year, the Falks planned to go through the grandparent citizenship route again. Unfortunately, it wasn’t as easy this time around.  After applying in April, Dee, Brian, their daughter, and two grandchildren, made the 20-plus-hour trip back to Nebraska, for vacation, family weddings, and citizenship. But immigration never called them back. Dee reached out, left messages, tried to track down a person, to learn where they stood.  “We weren’t hearing anything and we got concerned,” Dee said. Someone gave her one of my team member’s card and suggested she reach out. Dee was surprised. “In my mind I’m thinking, ‘Why? What can they do to help?’”  The first week of July, Dee finally reached someone at immigration. They told her to expect a 6-month wait. Dee said she got a sick feeling in her stomach. That wasn’t doable for the family headed back to Taiwan at the end of July. So Dee called our team in Lincoln at 4:45 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon. By the next morning, my team had talked to a contact we had in the agency. We didn’t know what was possible, but we knew we could ask the folks at Customs and Immigration. So my team explained the situation and USCIS staff told us they would see what could be done.   Good news — not only did they coordinate to process Rylee’s records, they arranged the interview so she would go home with her citizenship the next week.  “It was just phenomenal,” Dee says. “The timing was incredible. We wouldn’t have been able to get it done without help. I believe that God had a hand in all that too.”  We know there are other folks like Dee, who need government help, but are facing federal bureaucracies with a sinking feeling in their gut. We want to let those folks know we’re here to help. One of the most important jobs of the legislative branch is to make sure that when Nebraskans have problems with the federal government, you have a place to go. My team and I can’t always solve the problem, but we can find someone who can give you a status update, or the next step.

As we celebrate God’s great gift to us, I’m also thinking about the people of North Platte, Nebraska who organized an extraordinary gift of their own.  On this day in 1941, a group of women started the North Platte Canteen, a hospitality outreach for servicemen that would touch more than six million U.S. troops headed to war. Every day, trains stopped at North Platte for 10 minutes to fill their tanks. Rae Wilson, a 26-year-old sales girl whose brother led a unit during the war, started the canteen to use those 10 minutes to cheer troops on their way to the front. On Christmas Day in 1941, she and her friends met the 11 p.m. train with fruit, candy, and encouragement. They didn’t know the soldiers on board would become POWs in the Philippines.   Over the next four years, more than 6 million men came through the North Platte Canteen. Today, we remember Rae and her volunteers. May they inspire us to be generous and kind this season.  Merry Christmas.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorSasse/videos/1467462776684996/",NA,406,53,109,58,1,1,2,5
