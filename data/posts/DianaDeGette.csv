They will roll back progress on immigration policy that our country has made during the past eight years.   Notably, these orders would reinstate the Secure Communities program that Colorado has already tried and soundly rejected. They direct the Department of Homeland Security not only to build a wall we don't need, but also to build more detention centers and hold individuals there in violation of their due process rights.  And they threaten to withhold federal funds from any jurisdiction that doesn't agree with the new draconian policies, putting millions of dollars for Colorado in question.  President Trump's orders today do not reflect long-held American values. They do not reflect Colorado values.

Congress created this program 25 years ago to help safety net providers leverage their scarce resources to serve more people, especially low-income and vulnerable patients. Troubling reports from Government Accountability Office and the HHS Office of Inspector General have found there is a need for more oversight to ensure that the program achieves its critical mission. However, I am even more concerned by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid’s recently proposed rule dramatically reducing Medicare Part B drug reimbursements for 340B hospitals. I want to work with this committee to fairly address the 340B program’s problems, but using hearings to attack it won’t solve the crisis of rising prescription drug costs. To achieve this goal, Congress must hold more hearings and consider legislation that will tackle the issue head-on – and we must strengthen resources such as 340B, not gut them","video","https://www.facebook.com/DianaDeGette/videos/10155655376153489/",NA,64,22,6,4,0,0,0,1

Abuse of prescription drugs and the use of heroin are claiming thousands of lives and wrecking even more.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, every 19 minutes, an American dies from an unintentional drug overdose – and each day, 78 Americans die from opioid-related overdose. President Donald J. Trump recently declared the situation a national emergency, but without implementation guidelines, it’s unclear what this might mean. As a senior member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I’ve worked to reduce the epidemic’s impact through legislation that removes federal barriers to implementation of prevention and treatment programs.  And my bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act, which became law in December 2016, included $1 billion over two years to fight opioid abuse.  This funding is awarded to states through grants based on need.  Colorado is receiving $7.8 for opioid treatment and prevention as a result of 21st Century Cures.  The state is using these funds to pay for medication-assisted therapy, family therapy, overdose reversal medications, emergency room pilot studies, training for primary care doctors and nurses, residential treatment and partnerships with law enforcement.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/DianaDeGette/photos/a.10155767692278489.1073741837.110757973488/10155767692388489/?type=3",NA,40,1,0,2,1,0,0,1

Funding for this critical program that covers about 90,000 children and pregnant women in our state is set to expire at the end of this month. At the Federico F. Peña Southwest Family Health Center, Dr. Steve Federico, Director of General Pediatrics, and Andrew C. Montoya, a parent with a child enrolled in CHIP, joined me in urging Congress to reject partisan wrangling and renew the program. A revived debate over #ACA repeal through the latest #GrahamCassidy legislation is distracting us from meeting this important deadline that will protect millions of kids. Republicans owe it to them to move past their dangerous repeal schemes and work across the aisle to ensure and expand care, not rip it away.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/DianaDeGette/photos/a.153523148488.111218.110757973488/10155844821753489/?type=3",NA,154,33,28,7,0,1,5,2

They’re working to revive the spirit of bipartisanship exhibited by their father that made him a beloved and effective public servant. They rightly note that today, “compromise is not just a dirty word in politics. To many politicians, it’s a cardinal sin.” But I’m one of those who regards it as a virtue, and I’ve worked hard in Congress to reach across the aisle to accomplish big things, such as 21st Century Cures, the sweeping biomedical research bill that I co-authored with Republican Congressman Fred Upton of Michigan that was signed into law in late 2016. Last week, I was honored to be recognized by their foundation for this achievement. Like the Javits family, I also challenge Congress to reject partisanship and embrace cooperation.

This vital agency faces a 30% cut from President Trump’s proposed budget, making it even more critical to determine whether Mr. Pruitt is a responsible steward of limited taxpayer funds.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/DianaDeGette/photos/a.153523148488.111218.110757973488/10156069885198489/?type=3",NA,127,19,9,5,0,1,0,7

People with diabetes depend on this life-saving drug, but it is becoming out of reach for far too many, perhaps due to needless cost increases along the complicated supply chain that brings it to market. At a hearing of the Health Subcommittee on drug pricing, I asked witnesses representing pharmaceutical companies, pharmacy benefit managers and insurers if they would commit to sharing information with us about this supply chain. Having this information, among other knowledge, will ensure our inquiry gets to the root causes of sky-high insulin prices, which will help Congress determine the best ways to lower them.","video","https://www.facebook.com/DianaDeGette/videos/10156072642083489/",NA,58,15,6,0,0,0,3,1
