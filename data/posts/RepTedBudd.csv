As some may remember, the last administration brokered a deal with Iran that would get rid of many sanctions in exchange for a pause on the Iranian nuclear program.  Like many, I had concerns about our country signing something that would give permanent sanctions relief in exchange for a temporary pause of nuclear activity.    I’d offer that the signal that sends to neighbors in the region is that they have ten years to get their own nuclear weapons before the Iranians get a nuclear weapon.  It would be very bad news indeed for our national security to see a nuclearized Middle East, one of the most unstable parts of the world. In the hearing, I talked a little about how we might reduce the negative impact of the Iran deal by adding new sanctions not covered by the last administration's deal.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepTedBudd/videos/1308343169243065/",NA,18,7,5,0,0,0,0,0

It’s an agency with a great mission--protecting the consumer from predatory financial companies. I agree with its mission in many aspects, but at the same time people from all walks of life have also let me know that they’re not happy with the way the agency has gone about that mission. Just about every single business that’s worked with them has come away unhappy, and there are many stories of excessive spending and unfair practices surrounding the agency.  My questions focused on a longtime concern of mine, which is that public service is all too often a passport to self-enrichment in the private sector.  It’s how we end up with one of the most regulated financial systems in the world, that is also one of the most unstable in terms of bailouts and panics. Hope you’ll watch and share your thoughts on this.","link","http://cs.pn/2nZ7yVo","cs.pn",5,9,1,0,0,0,0,3

For many small business owners, local banks provided them their first shot at success. But the local banks that once assisted in building our communities, are now struggling to stay afloat due to the wave of regulations that Dodd-Frank has caused. Since Dodd-Frank came in community banks have disappeared. When I talk to bankers at home, a common theme seems to be that the fastest growing aspect of their business is the compliance department. For every resource diverted to filling out federal paperwork in the growing backroom, there is one less person working to help grow our economy.   Today, the House Committee on Financial Services begins the markup of the Financial #CHOICEAct.

Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), that would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a national strategy to combat terrorism financing.  This legislation gets at the idea that we need an all-of-the-above strategy to combat international terrorism.  Too often this is looked at from a perspective of military intervention vs. diplomacy, but what this bill speaks to is the fact that there’s a number ways we can address the problem.  Availability of funding, along with radical Islamist ideologies, are among the roots of terrorism.  It’s worth remembering that Al Capone was arrested and jailed not because of violent acts he had committed, but because he was evading federal taxes.  It’s my hope that the national strategy our bill calls for has a similar degree of success.  My statement on the bill is below...  https://budd.house.gov/media/press-releases/budd-sinema-introduce-legislation-combat-terrorist-financing-0","link","https://budd.house.gov/media/press-releases/budd-sinema-introduce-legislation-combat-terrorist-financing-0","budd.house.gov",39,17,2,3,1,2,0,0

Kate’s law, a bill that would toughen penalties for those who come here illegally, commit crimes, and then re-enter the country, passed the House with bipartisan support, 257-167.  The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, a bill that would cut funding to cities that ignore federal immigration laws, passed the House 228-195. I voted yes on both, and I thought it was worth talking about why.     The Constitution says that Congress has the power “to establish a uniform rule of Naturalization.”  It’s one of the few powers that are explicitly given to the federal government, based on the notion that immigration and borders are a national issue.  Congress has done so a number of times, most recently in 1996 when then-President Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act into law.     If every state or city could ignore those laws, then whichever city or state with the loosest laws would set policy for everyone else.  What struck me about the sanctuary cities bill was that it was an attempt to get us back towards an immigration policy that is truly national in nature.  There are potentially tragic consequences for having an uneven approach on this front.     The circumstances of Kate Steinle’s death, the young woman for whom the other bill was named, adds urgency to this goal.  Kate Steinle was walking with her father in San Francisco when she was shot to death by an illegal alien who had been deported five times.  The federal government had issued a detention order for her murderer, but because San Francisco is a sanctuary city, Kate Steinle’s murderer was not deported before he had a chance to commit his crime.       The bill that was named for her would toughen penalties for those who come into our country, are deported for committing felonies, and then come back again.

Given that I’ve introduced a bill on that front to create a unified national strategy across the federal government, it struck me as reasonable to ensure that was one component of our country’s foreign policy activities in Syria.    The amendment was approved by the House, and will become part of the final bill that is going to the Senate.  After both houses pass the defense bill, there will likely be a conference committee where the House and Senate will iron out some of the differences between the bills before they send the final product over to the president for his signature.  Since the overall bill has this reform in it as well as many others, I’m hoping that we’ll see speedy action on it going forward.","status",NA,NA,34,15,0,0,0,0,0,3

The first time we will establish and authorize the budget, and the second time we will enable military departments and agencies to use the funds from the United States Treasury.  One bill will create the plan, and the other will fund the plan. The bill we voted on today is the plan bill--the funding bill will come later this year.     The House passing of 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) upholds our commitment to the Constitution as Congress continues to reform the way the Department of Defense operates. The 2018 NDAA will begin rebuilding our military by increasing the size of our departments as well as enhancing our defenses by modernizing our strategies and weapons.  Perhaps most importantly, the troops will get a substantial pay raise, the largest in 8 years.    As a part of the improvements to our strategies, I am proud to have worked with both parties to contribute an amendment to the FY18 NDAA.

Yesterday afternoon, the Senate voted in favor of proceeding to debate how we should reform our country’s health system. Over the next couple of days, members of the Senate will debate and vote on many amendments aimed to improve our health care system.   The Constitution requires any bill that seeks to make changes to taxes needs to start here in the House, which is why the Senate could not begin this process until the House passed a bill. In early May, we sent the American Health Care Act over to them. Since then, Senators have been engaged in a lengthy debate on how best to reform our healthcare system. With a divided conference, like ours, finding consensus is never easy.   At the end of this process, it’s my hope that the Senate sends us back a product that will lower premiums for people buying on the individual marketplace and repeals the individual mandate, ensuring that Americans aren’t forced to buy health insurance by the federal government against their own will.

Where I think there’s more agreement is that, if the government does decide to spend money, it should make sure that taxpayer dollars are used as wisely as possible.    There’s a law called the Davis-Bacon Act that was created during the New Deal to ensure that the federal government did not come into smaller communities and overwhelm the local labor market with low wages.  It requires federal contracts to pay the “prevailing wage.”  How they get to that number is a badly flawed process--sometimes it’s as much as double the market wage, other times it’s minimum wage.  It’s been estimated that Davis-Bacon adds about 10 percent to the cost of federal construction projects.    I joined with Congressman Francis Rooney, a member from Florida, last night to offer an amendment that partially overturns this law, and helps get us to a place where the federal government is getting the best bang for the taxpayer buck when it does decide to spend money.

Previously, Hyosung had copied Diebold’s technology, and itself lost a major case in front of the International Trade Commission.

My reasoning for this amendment is simple… I don’t think it is right for one project to suck up all the funds that were intended for projects throughout the country.   Tonight, I debated my amendment on the House floor to make the case against sending 100 percent of FY 2018 funds to a project that New Jersey cancelled in 2010, because of the high price tag. It isn’t right for North Carolina taxpayers to have to send their hard earned dollars to pay for a tunnel in New Jersey.   This is a big earmark, in fact, it is 300 times the size of the average earmark when they were legal. Billions are about to pour out of Washington.  If this earmark stands, then we send a unfortunate message to states governments: shortchange your infrastructure, and Washington will bail you out.

Unfortunately, the Senate decided to use this as an opportunity to change what was an immediate disaster relief bill into a government funding and debt-ceiling increase bill as well.  The people who have had their way of life washed away from them do not have time for Congress to be attaching irrelevant items to what was a clean disaster relief bill.

While there will always be debate on how the changes should be made, most people agree that an outdated tax code isn’t healthy for our economy.   I want to see three things happen as a result of this bill: leave middle-class families in our State with more money in their pocket next year and in years to come, bring jobs back from overseas and simplify the tax filing process for everyone. The framework released today would do all of those things.   While the framework includes many different provisions, I want to point to two of them that would be a boost to families at home and our country’s economy, at large.   First, this plan would nearly double the standard deduction for both individuals and married couples, meaning that the first $12,000 you earn (and $24,000 for joint filers) is completely tax-free. For many people, the process of itemizing deductions is fairly complex and burdensome, as taxpayers have to track and record relevant expenses throughout the year, and possibly longer. Doubling the standard deduction will allow many more families to avoid itemizing their deductions, saving time, and providing a major tax reduction even for those who do not itemize.    The other part of the released framework that I thought was worth highlighting is that it would bring the corporate tax rate down to 20% from its current rate of 38.9%. We need to attract businesses to stay here, and if they have left, to return. This is something that many countries around the world have already figured out, and was even supported by the last Administration.    It’s a long way from a plan to a bill to a law, but this is an important first step, and I’m going to do what I can to see this plan executed and signed into law.","video","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV_X37DBlHI",NA,52,44,7,2,2,0,0,11

Americans are required to turn over a host of financial information to the Treasury Department, and accordingly, we should be doing what we can to make sure that this information is as secure as possible.  Today, I introduced a bill, Treasury Innovation Act, to help secure our financial info from data breaches. This legislation would financially reward those who discover and report issues with the Treasury Department’s servers. Federal computer systems are prime targets for hackers, and harnessing the power of the private sector to find and eliminate vulnerabilities before hackers strike is an important tool in the toolkit for increased data security.

It strikes me as common sense that if we’re going to take money from law abiding taxpayers, we ought not to be giving it to lawbreaking recipients.   This week, I voted in favor of a bill that will help fix this problem by reining in government payments to parole violators.   The CUFF Act would prevent individuals with active arrest warrants and parole violators from receiving Supplemental Security Income payments, saving around $200 million in federal spending a year.

The answer to all of these questions are ‘yes.’  Specifically, as a result of this bill the average middle-class family in my district earning $59,000 will receive a $1,182 tax cut. Rather than giving it to the IRS, a family would be able to keep this money and use for more important things such as raising their children or paying down debt.

While all these bills help make a difference for Americans, there is one that I spoke in favor of earlier today: HR 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran’s Access to Finance Act.  The Iran regime continue to find new and creative ways to bypass sanctions to fund their worldwide terror network.  Lifting sanctions on Iran not only opens the United States up to potentially financing Iran’s destabilizing activity and terror program in the region, it also creates potential money laundering risks for American financial institutions.   It is my hope that the bill will serve as an effective counterweight to Iranian destabilization efforts in the region.

In total, the committee has approved 63 bills, since my first day serving on Financial Service back in January. Overall, the bills passed this week are aimed at getting our economy working by providing accountability and transparency in the financial system. Of these bills, there are two that I would like to highlight: Restoring Financial Market Freedom Act of 2017, HR 4247 and HR 4293, Stress Test Improvement Act.  The first one is a bill that I introduced, the Restoring Financial Market Freedom Act of 2017, HR 4247. This legislation addresses Title VIII of Dodd-Frank, which creates another category of too big to fail financial firms and gives them an explicit government backstop.  My bill would reverse that decision, and it was reported out of Committee by a majority vote.    The final bill that I would like to highlight this evening is HR 4293, Stress Test Improvement Act. What this one comes down to is the idea that to follow the law, it’s fair that people have an idea what exactly the law is.  Right now, banks get tested by their regulators for soundness.  In order to avoid letting banks game their tests, the Federal Reserve keeps the criteria secret.  It’s a little bit like going into an exam at school where the teacher doesn’t tell anyone what the exam is actually going to test.    This bill gets at is the notion that stress testing is a useful exercise, but it should be a transparent, regular, and predictable exercise. Overall, I look forward to seeing the bills move to the floor.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepTedBudd/videos/1518011898276190/",NA,25,31,1,0,1,0,1,12

What this underscores is just how important it is we continue to maintain our military, and to continue to attack sources of financing and money laundering that North Korea uses to fund its technology.  It is only a matter of time before North Korea acquires the ability to launch an attack on the entire United States unless we are able to stop their pursuit of this capability.    Ultimately, looking at the issue from the short-term from a congressional perspective, demands that immigration amnesty be included funding bills at the end of this year have the potential to disrupt the operations of our military by leading to a shutdown.

Basically, the facts of the case are that after Richard Cordray, the current leader of the agency, resigned his position, President Trump appointed Mick Mulvaney to serve in his place.  Cordray appointed his own successor, Leandra English, leaving two people with the same title vying for control of the bureau.    The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a controversial agency, and I voted for a bill that would replace the single director with a bipartisan commission, in line with other independent agencies of the federal government, such as the Federal Trade Commission or the Securities Exchange Commission.  Others in Congress, particularly those who are more left-leaning, resisted doing so.  I voted as I did because I had concerns about vesting so much power in the hands of a single unelected individual--in particular someone that isn’t part of our three-branch system.      Now we have something of a crisis. Even though the federal courts have ruled that Trump’s choice has control of the agency, there is a long appeals process ahead.  In the meantime, what happens if Mulvaney says one thing, and English says another?  Who are banks and credit unions supposed to listen to?    Ultimately, my hope is this mini-crisis isn’t a sign of greater constitutional issues to come.  It’s important that even in times like these, where emotions are running high in the political process, that we respect the powers laid down in the Constitution.","status",NA,NA,67,95,7,1,1,1,4,27

This is part of my ongoing effort to address our country’s opioid epidemic.   One of the problems we face with the epidemic is there isn’t a nationwide system in place to track a patient’s prescription history. One consequence from this is that it allows for dealers and addicts to get away with using fraudulent paper prescriptions. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 27 percent of those at the highest risk of overdose are prescribed painkillers by more than 1 physician. The bill aims to eliminate duplicative prescriptions  This bill would require all prescribers to to use an electronic health record, which allows states to monitor and track the use of opioids.

The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act would, if it went into law, address this problem by bringing much needed clarity to the system. H.R. 38 is a simple proposal, but a necessary one, and if enacted it will allow lawful owners to carry their firearm into other states that allow concealed carry.

This bill would increase congressional oversight on commercial aircraft sales to Iran. Since we’ve lifted sanctions on Iran under the Iran Nuclear Agreement, including government controlled entities like Iran Air, we’ve opened ourselves up to potentially financing Iran’s destabilizing activity in the region. We need more oversight on these commercial aircraft sales.   This bill is necessary because even this year, we’ve seen Iran Air continue to fly well- known weapon resupply routes to Pro-Assad controlled areas of Syria. Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, will always continue to find new and creative ways to bypass sanctions to fund their worldwide terror network. We must stay on constant alert, and this bill helps us do just that.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepTedBudd/videos/1543612649049448/",NA,34,16,4,0,1,0,0,5
