Sadly, this accurately summarizes his outreach to those who disagree with him over the past 8 years.  President Obama is here to defend his legacy, which includes the disastrous Affordable Care Act. With President Obama having less than a month left in office, he is spending an increasing amount of his time talking up his ""accomplishments"" in office. I recently watched one of those speeches, and was amazed by the bubble that President Obama has placed himself in that causes him to view facts so different from the rest of us. Here are some examples:  ""Through diplomacy, we shut down Iran‚Äôs nuclear weapons program""  (Really? Because I thought we just gave them billions of dollars that they can use to fund and expand terrorism, and paid a ransom to get American citizens back. I also have not seen any clear evidence that our actions have resulted in Iran stopping Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. In fact, many Obama Administration officials have said they goal is to slow them down, not stop them from obtaining one.)   ""(We) opened up a new chapter with the people of Cuba""   (A new chapter that was done without the consent of Congress, that overlooked the human rights of the Cuban people for President Obama's personal legacy)  ""brought nearly 200 nations together around a climate agreement""  (again, and did so without working with Congress so President Trump can undo it on his first day in office)  ""Almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago.""  (This is just completely false. The Obama Administration has betrayed allies like Israel, broken agreements with country's like Ukraine, has made the world a more dangerous place by underestimating threats like ISIS, helped contribute to a humanitarian crisis in Syria by getting involved in a civil war, and have done nothing to combat Chinese aggression in the Pacific.)  The good news my friends is that January 20th with be here before you know it, and we have all the tools we need to Make America Great Again!","status",NA,NA,318,69,83,17,2,4,3,30

The bill also includes a provision to refund the $200 transfer tax to applicants who purchase a suppressor after October 22, 2015, which was the original date of introduction. This legislation is about safety ‚Äì plain and simple. I‚Äôm very active in sport shooting and hunting, and I can‚Äôt tell you how better off the shooting sports enthusiasts would be if we had easier access to suppressors to help protect our hearing.   I‚Äôve been shooting since I was a young child - beginning with plinking with a .22 rifle and dove hunting with my Dad.  My hearing has been damaged  because of gun noise. Had I had access to a suppressor, it may have protected me, as well as millions of other Americans, from this sort of hearing loss. This is a health issue even recognized in Europe. It just doesn‚Äôt make any sense to regulate suppressors the way we do presently.  I think it certainly is questionable from a constitutional standpoint.

The Senate is working faster than I've ever seen during my time in Congress. Their first priority when the new Congress convened was to pass a budget resolution. Why is this important? Because the budget process is the method we're using to repeal ObamaCare and fulfill the promises we've made to the American people. We're voting on the Senate budget resolution in the House today, and I expect it to pass overwhelmingly. Once the budget resolution has passed, Congress will then be able to use a process called ""budget reconciliation"" to repeal President Obama's failed healthcare law. Ironically, this is the same process Democrats used to originally pass ObamaCare. By using budget reconciliation, the repeal bill will only need a simple majority to pass the Senate and cannot be filibustered.  There are Democrats that are saying this budget bill is terrible because it doesn't offer a replacement plan for ObamaCare. This claim is just political gamesmanship because the budget resolution is not the vehicle that would be used to offer up a replacement plan. My hope and the current Republican plan is to repeal and replace ObamaCare as close to simultaneously as possible, while creating some type of transition period as a bridge to the new law. The other false claim is that Republicans don't have a replacement plan at all. That too is false. In fact, I have co-sponsored replacement bills every year I have been in Congress, the most recent version is HR 277. The final product may change as it works through the legislative process and receive more input from the public, but the key free market based principles are all outlined in the legislation already filed.  Another big project Congress is working on is confirming President-Elect Trump's Cabinet nominees. This week, the Senate held hearings to confirm Jeff Sessions for Attorney General, Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State, Ben Carson for HUD, and General James ""Mad Dog"" Mattis for Secretary of Defense. Governor Haley and Congressman Mulvaney's hearings for UN Ambassador and OMB Director will take place next week. As a House Member, I don't have a vote on these nominees with one notable exception. Since General Mattis has recently retired from the military, he will need a special waiver in order to serve as Sec. Def. I look forward to voting to grant him that waiver this afternoon.  After watching the confirmation hearings this week, I continue to be extremely impressed with the top of leaders President Elect Trump has selected to serve in his cabinet.  I hope this update was helpful, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.","status",NA,NA,306,102,70,19,0,1,1,4

Construction of these pipelines will also provide thousands of good-paying, private sector jobs and get more Americans working.

This event may not fit neatly in the narrative of some in the media, and the rally signs and speakers aren't as vulgar or controversial as the women's march last week, but the issues being discussed are some of the most important in the world.

Man created government as a way to help protect those God-given natural rights. If government won't stand up and protect life, what is the purpose of government?

I am proud of Vice-President Pence for being the first Vice-President in American history to speak at March for Life.

The actions are being massively mischaracterized by the left, so I am going to post the executive action in its entirety for you to review. After everyone has had a chance to review it, I will follow up with some comments explaining what it does and why it is a common sense step to keep America safe:  EXECUTIVE ORDER  PROTECTING THE NATION FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES          By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:        Section 1.  Purpose.  The visa-issuance process plays a crucial role in detecting individuals with terrorist ties and stopping them from entering the United States.  Perhaps in no instance was that more apparent than the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when State Department policy prevented consular officers from properly scrutinizing the visa applications of several of the 19 foreign nationals who went on to murder nearly 3,000 Americans.  And while the visa-issuance process was reviewed and amended after the September 11 attacks to better detect would-be terrorists from receiving visas, these measures did not stop attacks by foreign nationals who were admitted to the United States.        Numerous foreign-born individuals have been convicted or implicated in terrorism-related crimes since September 11, 2001, including foreign nationals who entered the United States after receiving visitor, student, or employment visas, or who entered through the United States refugee resettlement program. Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States.  The United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.        In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles.  The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law.  In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including ""honor"" killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.        Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.        Sec. 3.  Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall immediately conduct a review to determine the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat.        (b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security's determination of the information needed for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 30 days of the date of this order.  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence.        (c)  To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening of foreign nationals, and to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists or criminals, pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas).        (d)  Immediately upon receipt of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request all foreign governments that do not supply such information to start providing such information regarding their nationals within 60 days of notification.        (e)  After the 60-day period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion on a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of foreign nationals (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas) from countries that do not provide the information requested pursuant to subsection (d) of this section until compliance occurs.        (f)  At any point after submitting the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment.        (g)  Notwithstanding a suspension pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or pursuant to a Presidential proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.        (h)  The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 30 days of the date of this order, a second report within 60 days of the date of this order, a third report within 90 days of the date of this order, and a fourth report within 120 days of the date of this order.        Sec. 4.  Implementing Uniform Screening Standards for All Immigration Programs.  (a)  The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall implement a program, as part of the adjudication process for immigration benefits, to identify individuals seeking to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission. This program will include the development of a uniform screening standard and procedure, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that the applicant is who the applicant claims to be; a process to evaluate the applicant's likelihood of becoming a positively contributing member of society and the applicant's ability to make contributions to the national interest; and a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States.        (b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of this directive within 60 days of the date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the date of this order.        Sec. 5.  Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017.  (a)  The Secretary of State shall suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days.  During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication process to determine what additional procedures should be taken to ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures.  Refugee applicants who are already in the USRAP process may be admitted upon the initiation and completion of these revised procedures.  Upon the date that is 120 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall resume USRAP admissions only for nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that such additional procedures are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.        (b)  Upon the resumption of USRAP admissions, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.  Where necessary and appropriate, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall recommend legislation to the President that would assist with such prioritization.        (c)  Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.        (d)  Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I determine that additional admissions would be in the national interest.        (e)  Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest -- including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution, when admitting the person would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement, or when the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship -- and it would not pose a risk to the security or welfare of the United States.        (f)  The Secretary of State shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the directive in subsection (b) of this section regarding prioritization of claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution within 100 days of the date of this order and shall submit a second report within 200 days of the date of this order.      (g)  It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees.  To that end, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.        Sec. 6.  Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility.  The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority in section 212 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182, relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing memoranda.        Sec. 7.  Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking system for all travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.        (b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive contained in subsection (a) of this section.  The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the date of this order.  Further, the Secretary shall submit a report every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.        Sec. 8.  Visa Interview Security.  (a)  The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1222, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions.        (b)  To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that non-immigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected.        Sec. 9.  Visa Validity Reciprocity.  The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment.  If a country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by the foreign country, to the extent practicable.        Sec. 10.  Transparency and Data Collection.  (a)  To be more transparent with the American people, and to more effectively implement policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available within 180 days, and every 180 days thereafter:   (i)   information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation, or material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national security reasons since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later;   (ii)   information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and   (iii)  information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including honor killings, in the United States by foreign nationals, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and   (iv)   any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.        (b)  The Secretary of State shall, within one year of the date of this order, provide a report on the estimated long-term costs of the USRAP at the Federal, State, and local levels.        Sec. 11.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:   (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or   (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.        (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.        (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Yesterday I posted a full copy of the executive order for you to read, and as promised, I would now like to take a few moments to provide context and help dispel the rumors about these new rules.  Even before the attacks in Nice, Paris, and Berlin, I vocally expressed my concern about the threat of radical Islamic terrorism and the need to avoid repeating Europe‚Äôs mistakes by carefully reviewing our immigration and refugee resettlement programs. Of the refugee resettlement programs out there, there is one country in particular that has concerned me and that‚Äôs Syria. It is impossible to properly vet someone from Syria due to the ongoing civil war. Most people don‚Äôt have documentation, and it is difficult to verify people‚Äôs identities and backgrounds. It has been well reported that people from other countries are even attempting to pose as Syrian refugees in order to gain access to Europe and the United States. While many of these people are doing this in hopes of achieving a better life, there are numerous recorded instances of terrorists disguising themselves as refugees in order to enter other countries. In fact, Michael McCaul, Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, recently reported that there have been roughly 500 known instances of terrorists and people with terrorist ties attempting to enter United States through the refugee resettlement program, which again is remarkable given how little we know about these people. While President Obama was in office, he ignored calls from many Governors like Nikki Haley to not send Syrian refugees to their state because of vetting concerns. And despite the growing threat of ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism, President Obama decided to actually increase the number of refugees he was planning on bringing into the United States to at least 100,000, a policy that was echoed by Secretary Clinton during the campaign.  Now let‚Äôs examine the facts of the Executive Order.   1) The EO does not end the global refugee resettlement program. It suspends the program for 120 days in order to review vetting and safety procedures. The order also caps the annual refugee number to around 50,000, which is roughly the average that it was during the Bush Administration. However, the actual number of refugees we will bring into the United States will most likely be significantly higher than that because it does not include people who come here on their own like the unaccompanied children from Central America, and extended family members of people who have already settled in the US. However, the Executive Order does halt the Syrian refugee program due to the concerns I previously outlined.   Some have criticized this move saying we have a moral obligation to help the Syrian people. I agree that we are a compassionate people and we do need to help. However, the best way to help the humanitarian crisis in Syria is to stabilize the country, not bring in refugees that put Americans lives at risk. It‚Äôs worth noting that Franklin Graham who runs Samaritan‚Äôs Purse, one of the largest Christian aid organizations providing relief to Syrian refugees, also shares this belief.  Back in 2011, I warned the Obama Administration against taking sides in the middle of the civil war. Despite those concerns, the Obama Administration gave weapons to factions of the Syrian rebels, some of which fell into the hands of ISIS. To complicate things even more, the Syrian government is backed by Russia, which only further draws out the conflict. The best way to address the humanitarian crisis in Syria is to broker some sort of agreement with Russia (which is ironic given how much the left has made political hay out of President Trump‚Äôs attempt to improve relations with Russia on issues like terrorism), and to establish safe zones for the Syrian people, something that the Syrian rebels had asked President Obama to do for years but he refused. Building safe zones in Syria will help far more people than what even President Obama proposed we do through the refugee resettlement program.  2) Does President Trump‚Äôs executive order create a Muslim ban? Absolutely not. President Trump‚Äôs order created a 90 day moratorium for visa travelers from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and Libya while we assess the screening and vetting process with these countries. Three of these countries have been classified as terrorist safe havens by the Obama Administration, the other three have known terrorist organizations operating within them. You‚Äôll notice that the largest Muslim majority country in the world, Indonesia, isn‚Äôt even on this list. That is because again, this is not a Muslim ban. This part of the Executive Order addresses the real concerns about the situation on the ground in these countries. Iran for example is the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, with terrorist assets and agents scattered all across the Western Hemisphere. Because President Obama ignored a bipartisan coalition in Congress by lifting sanctions and giving billions of dollars to Iran, they are now better financed to further fund their terrorist efforts throughout the globe. I believe this warrants taking some precautions to protect the American people.  3) What am I hearing about President Trump wanting to retool refugee program to assist religious and ethnic minorities? The refugee program has long sought to help religious and ethnic minorities because they are at a higher risk of persecution. That‚Äôs why it was so alarming that during President Obama‚Äôs watch, Christian Syrians were significantly under represented in the refugee resettlement program. Christians make up roughly 10% of the population in Syria, but only accounted for less than .05% of those who were admitted to the United States. Not only does this deserve a full investigation to determine how and why this happened, but it reveals the need to ensure we are helping the most vulnerable first. That does not only include Christians in the Middle East, but also Kurds, Jews, and those of the Bahai faith. President Trump‚Äôs order does not say that only religious and ethnic minorities would be helped under the refugee resettlement program, but rather they would be an increased focus.  Final thoughts. The White House announced that 325,000 people from foreign countries traveled to the United States this past Saturday, and out of those only 109 were initially detained and the vast majority of those have been released. The Executive Order allows for individual‚Äôs cases to be reviewed for admission into the United States on a case-by-case basis. So while there will be some adjustments that need to be made, there seems to be a process where these people can make the case for why they should not be subject to these new restrictions. At the end of the day, the media has a responsibility to report on facts. Calling this a Muslim ban is inaccurate. Posting pictures of the Statue of Liberty weeping is insulting. Ignoring the need to keep Americans safe is irresponsible. The news media has been more critical of President Trump before he even took office, than they ever were to President Obama and it is shameful. Let‚Äôs stick to the facts, and to me the facts clearly back up the President‚Äôs actions.","status",NA,NA,1717,352,2054,123,1,7,3,24

They are right.  America is a compassionate country, Americans are compassionate givers of their time and money, and America's benevolence is felt throughout the world - be it foodstuffs from America's rich farmland; roads, hospitals and schools built with US tax dollars in far away lands; or asylum granted to those persecuted by oppressive governments. The world knows of the effort, abilities and financial commitment put forth by the greatest nation in the history of man - the United States of America. Ì†ºÌ∑∫Ì†ºÌ∑∏  I ask that we, too, inject into our conversation on this Executive Pause:  ""Ought we not also to consider our compassion for our fellow Americans?""  I - and government in its smallest increment - have been charged with the safety and security of the nation. Yes, that is supporting a military for national defense, no argument. But our military was powerless when our nation was attacked in New York, Chattanooga, Orlando, Little Rock and San Bernardino and the sky over Pennsylvania.  Security of our nation also comes down to government making smart and commonsense decisions when it allows people to enter our nation to live among us.   Doesn't/shouldn't our compassion for our neighbors, our friends, our families and our communities also weigh into our decision-making?  Am I, and government, not charged with the responsibility to make sure we are doing everything in our power to make sure that those whom we, as a free and sovereign nation, allow to live in our communities are indeed who and what they claim to be?  When the heads of our national security team at DHS and FBI and DNI and CTC - all state concern, in Congressional testimony, of the inability to properly vet refugees from certain corners of the world, shouldn't we take notice and act?  Lest we allow some people with nefarious aims toward us, our families, our churches and our nation live in our midst.  And ISIS has said they will exploit our benevolence and enter the US as refugees. Shouldn't we we take them at their word?  Compassion isn't just exhibited when America sends money and expertise overseas. It isn't exhibited just when we, carte blanche, open our borders to the huddled masses. Compassion is also exhibited when concern for the safety and security of our fellow Americans is at the forefront of American policies.  Because if past government policies of compassion toward those fleeing oppression and strife were truly the aim - as many would have you believe - that the United States should open its doors freely to those and all refugees - then why did the government, in January 2017, during the last days of President Obama, change its policy toward Cuban refugees? A policy that is decades old. The Castro government, in many ways, is just as oppressive as the ones in Somalia and Sudan. The Cuban refugees turned back from US soil will most certainly face unthinkable circumstances once they return to Cuba as people who fled the island nation. Where are Chuck Schumer's tears for those people?  Because - this policy change was not a PAUSE - but rather a REVERSAL on long-standing US policy.  So - in summation of a very long post: our compassion and benevolence should and WILL return to those oppressed and war-torn areas covered by this Executive Order. Our compassion and responsibility dictate that policy makers should also consider the safety and security of our fellow Americans here closer to home: our neighborhood streets. And if the arguments are truly going to center on the need for America to immediately be benevolent to oppressed people throughout the world, why has America reversed course toward the oppressed Cubans after so long - and in light of hyperbole over the Executive Order?

Based on his record, I believe it is clear that Neil Gorsuch will be a Justice who looks to the wisdom of our Founding Fathers by following the Constitution and refuting judicial activism. While the vast majority of comments I've heard from constituents have been positive and recognize that Gorsuch is unquestionably well-qualified for the position, some have pointed to the Senate's refusal to confirm Merrick Garland as reason for why Judge Gorsuch's nomination should be blocked. I wanted to take a moment to explain why I feel that is unfair.  During President Obama's 8 years in office, there were numerous unprecedented actions from the Executive Branch. Here are some specific examples: 1) ObamaCare was passed into law over the objection of every Republican in Congress. 2) President Obama created the CFBP an entity not subject to Congressional oversight or appropriations, certain provisions of which were later ruled to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, 3) issued illegal and constitutional recess appointments that the Supreme Court struck down in a rare unanimous decision 4) spent billions of dollars on ObamaCare that was not appropriated by Congress, forcing the Legislative Branch to take the Executive Branch to court in a historic case which the Legislative Branch has successfully won at every level, 5) created law on his own through his executive amnesty program which was also struck down by the courts, 6) illegally transferred GITMO detainees in violation of Congressional prohibitions, 7) went around bipartisan opposition in Congress to broker a flawed Iran deal.  Some will say President Obama had to do these things because Congress wouldn't work with him. I'll pay $100 to the first person who can point out where the ""Gridlock"" clause is in the United States Constitution that gives the President the power to do whatever he wants when Congress doesn't agree with him (I'll save you some time, it doesn't exist).  The key thing about many of these violations is they concerned key separation of powers issues that our Founding Fathers created to safeguard our Republic. By violating these checks and balances, President Obama forced Congress to respond more aggressively by enforcing other checks to balances in the system. When the President violates the appointment power by making illegal recess appointments and spending money that Congress hasn't approved, we have a big problem.  Seeing that we were constantly having to take the President to court to resolve these disputes, and seeing that the President had already violated three key tenets of the separation of power 1) enacting law on his own 2) confirming appointments without the Senate's advice and consent, 3) spending unauthorized funds, we were forced to take the step of refusing to confirm the President's Supreme Court nominee in response. I can understand why President Obama would be upset about this, considering that had we confirmed his person we would have altered the balance on the court in his favor, but I would hope others would at least understand why many felt we needed to deny a hearing to the President's nominee in order to preserve balance in our system.  Some may say that President Trump's actions require them to block his Supreme Court nominee. To that my response is, ""what actions?"" He's been on the job for two weeks! The protests started before he was ever even sworn in. The most controversial thing he's done is his national security executive order, which he has the power to do under the Immigration and Nationality Act which states ""Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.""  I provided a list of 7 actions that President Obama took that forced the Republican Congress to take the action of refusing to hold hearings on his Supreme Court nominee. I could come up with a lot more if I wanted to. President Trump has been in office for two weeks, and issued a handful of Executive Actions that are open to debate on the merits, but not on whether or not they are Constitutional.  I urge the Senate to be strong and confirm Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.","status",NA,NA,241,34,39,22,0,1,0,1

H.R. 844, the Terrorist Deportation Act, would make anyone that law enforcement officials have placed in the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) who isn‚Äôt a citizen or a permanent resident eligible for immediate and mandatory deportation proceedings. The legislation is very similar to legislation I filed in September 2016.  This new administration provides an opportunity for us to get serious about securing our country again and to get tough with the terrorists who threaten the safety of our citizens. My bill will make it harder for suspected terrorists to come to America and easier for our law enforcement and counter-terrorism professionals to remove suspected terrorists who are already here.  Under current procedures, when law enforcement officials have reasonable grounds of suspicion that a person might be a terrorist, they enter that person into the Terrorist Screening Database. The TSDB is estimated to have roughly one million people listed, of whom around 5% are US persons (defined as either citizens or permanent residents). The bill first makes those listed in the TSDB inadmissible into the country, then makes those who are in the country eligible for mandatory expedited deportation proceedings.  The bill also creates a due process hearing for those on the TSDB who may have been placed there by mistake.  It is important to note that this legislation will provide a legal avenue for those mistakenly in the terrorist database and the related no-fly list. While we are making America safer for our citizens, we must also do everything we can to protect the rights of American citizens who are mistakenly caught up in terror investigations.

But Democrats are still itching for a fight, and their first line of offense is the myth of the ‚Äústolen‚Äù seat.  ‚ÄúThis is a seat that was stolen from the former President, Obama,that‚Äôs never been done in U.S. history before,‚Äù declared Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley in announcing that he will attempt to filibuster Judge Gorsuch. ‚ÄúTo let this become normal just invites a complete partisan polarization of the Court from here to eternity.‚Äù The ‚Äústolen‚Äù line is echoing across Progressive Nation, but it‚Äôs a complete political invention.  The ‚Äútheft‚Äù is supposedly the GOP Senate‚Äôs refusal last year to vote on President Obama‚Äôs nomination of Merrick Garland to fill Antonin Scalia‚Äôs seat. But the standard of not confirming a Supreme Court nominee in the final year of a Presidency was set by . . . Democrats. And by no less a Beltway monument than the current Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer.  ‚ÄúWe should not confirm any Bush nominee to the Supreme Court, except in extraordinary circumstances,‚Äù Mr. Schumer declared in a July 2007 speech to the American Constitution Society. Democrats then held the Senate and Mr. Schumer was putting down a marker if someone on the High Court retired. George W. Bush didn‚Äôt get another opening, but Mr. Schumer surely meant what he said. The Democratic theft standard goes back further to Joe Biden‚Äôs days as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In June 1992 in President George H.W. Bush‚Äôs final year, Robber Joe opined that the President ‚Äúshould consider following the practice of a majority of his predecessors and not name a nominee until after the November election is completed.‚Äù  Naming a new Justice, he said, would ensure that a confirmation ‚Äúprocess that is already in doubt in the minds of many will become distrusted by all.‚Äù If Mr. Bush made an election-year nomination, Mr. Biden said his committee should consider ‚Äúnot scheduling confirmation hearings on the nomination until after the political campaign season is over.‚Äù  Does anyone outside the MSNBC audience think that had the roles been reversed in 2016, and a Democratic Senate faced a Republican Court nominee, Harry Reid would have held a confirmation vote? As John McEnroe liked to shout, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be serious!‚Äù  The ‚Äústolen‚Äù myth is being used to justify a filibuster that could block Judge Gorsuch‚Äôs confirmation with as few as 41 votes. Mr. Schumer said Tuesday that ‚Äúthe Senate must insist upon 60 votes for any Supreme Court nominee, a bar that was met by each of President Obama‚Äôs nominees.‚Äù  There he goes again. Republicans never invoked the trigger for a filibuster known as ‚Äúcloture‚Äù against either Sonia Sotomayor, who was confirmed 68-31 in 2009, or Elena Kagan, who was confirmed 63-37 in 2010. Republicans also helped to whoop through Bill Clintonnominees Ruth Bader Ginsburg 96-3 and Stephen Breyer 87-9.  The only recent attempt at filibustering a Supreme Court nominee was by Democrats against George W. Bush nominee Samuel Alito in 2006. Twenty-five Democrats filed for cloture, led by then Senator Obama, Hillary Clinton and Mr. Schumer. They lost that vote, but sometimes we fear that Senator Schumer‚Äôs memory may be fading since he can‚Äôt seem to recall his previous actions.  As for filibustering Judge Gorsuch, several Democrats up for re-election are saying they don‚Äôt want to do it. And Republicans shouldn‚Äôt invite a filibuster, notwithstanding President Trump‚Äôs comments Wednesday that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should change Senate rules to break a filibuster if he has to. If we‚Äôre certain about anything in politics it is that Mr. McConnell doesn‚Äôt need Donald Trump‚Äôs advice about running the Senate. The Majority Leader has more guile than Mr. Trump has bluster, and he knows it‚Äôs better politics to confirm the judge without breaking Senate rules.  But if forced to do so, Mr. McConnell can also invoke a Democratic precedent. Mr. Reid broke the filibuster to pack Mr. Obama‚Äôs nominees on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and last year he said Democrats would do the same for the Supreme Court if Mrs. Clinton won the election and his party held the Senate. ‚ÄúI have set the Senate so when I leave, we‚Äôre going to be able to get judges done with a majority,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey mess with the Supreme Court, it‚Äôll be changed just like that in my opinion.‚Äù  Losing vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine promised the same last October. ‚ÄúIf these guys think they‚Äôre going to stonewall the filling of that vacancy or other vacancies,‚Äù Mr. Kaine said, a Democratic majority ‚Äúwill change the Senate rules to uphold the law.‚Äù  Judge Gorsuch is such a distinguished nominee that he ought to be confirmed 100-0, but if Democrats try and fail to defeat him, the world should know that they are the authors of their own political frustration.","status",NA,NA,49,12,11,4,0,1,0,0

The paper, as reported by the Washington Post makes recommendations to a variety of government gun regulations.  In the paper he detailed the unnecessary level of current ‚Äúsilencer‚Äù ‚Äì also known as suppressor ‚Äì regulation under the National Firearms Act. The expansion of lawful suppressor usage has grown to 42 states, where the growing acceptance of suppressors has created a significant backlog of silencer applications with a processing time upwards of eight months. My bill, the Hearing Protection Act, eases these regulatory burdens and addresses the concerns detailed by ATF in the white paper.  This is a common sense approach to suppressor regulation in the United States. There is no legitimate reason to prevent hunters and recreational shooters from access to a device that may help to ease the impact of muzzle noise from a firearm. A suppressor does not silence a firearm. It suppresses the sound by 30 to 35 decibels. Exposure to noise over 140 decibels can permanently damage hearing and some of the most popular firearms are well above this threshold. Suppressors on these sorts of weapons will reduce the noise to the level of a jackhammer. Hearing protection is a real issue for hunters and recreational shooters. With a suppressor, these Americans will have easier access to limit excessive noise exposure. This is a no brainer.  The white paper details that ATF has on average over the past 10 years only recommended 44 defendants a year for prosecution on suppressor related violations. The paper goes on to say that suppressors ‚Äúare very rarely used in criminal shootings.‚Äù  H.R. 367, the Hearing Protection Act, would reduce suppressor regulation under the National Firearms Act (NFA) by reclassifying a ‚Äúsilencer‚Äù under the Gun Control Act (GCA) where they would be treated as a firearm under the law. This reclassification would replace NFA requirements with a GCA standard National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) ‚Äì the same legal obligations and prohibitions required when purchasing a standard firearm.  The Hearing Protection Act has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means as well as the House Judiciary Committee. Currently, the Hearing Protection Act is supported by 97 cosponsors in the House. The Senate companion bill, sponsored by Sen. Mike Crapo (ID), has seven cosponsors.","status",NA,NA,168,30,39,17,0,1,0,1

During the Obama Administration, Harry Reid and President Obama schemed up a plan to blow up the filibuster for confirmations. It was an unprecedented move, which gave President Obama the ability to flood the lower courts with some radical nominees. Now I believe some of this delay is coming from Democrats as a way to save face with their party's base who may now regret making such a move. Unfortunately, the result is that there are Obama appointees still in key positions of power who are acting in a partisan fashion to undermine President Trump and his policies. Democrats have opened pandora's box here, and if they don't stop immediately, this kind of political tug-of-war will become standard practice every time a President from the opposite party takes office.

The first regulation barred hunting and fishing from federal wilderness lands in Alaska, while the second stopped states from cutting Title X grant funding to abortion providers, most notably the disgraced Planned Parenthood organization.  We are still dealing with the full impacts of the executive overreach by the Obama presidency. I am glad to be able to turn back these terrible regulations and again allow states to make their own decisions about how resources are managed, both natural and financial.  The first vote returned wildlife management back to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.  As Co-Chair of the Congressional Sportsmen‚Äôs Caucus, I was particularly proud to vote to overturn the ill-advised Obama Administration rule banning hunting and fishing in Alaska.  Like all of our states, Alaska should be responsible for its own wildlife management practices, not unelected bureaucrats in a distant capital. This regulation represents a disturbing shift in the cooperative wildlife management relationship that states have enjoyed for years with the federal government.  I am proud to work with my friend Don Young of Alaska to restore Alaska‚Äôs rightful authority in this matter. Sportsmen around the country will be pleased by this action in the House today. The sustainable management of these natural resources needs to be a state-led function, and this rule would have set a bad precedent that could have negative implications for the lower 48 states as well.  The second vote will allow states to once again only direct Title X family planning funds to community health centers that do not engage in abortions or the trafficking of the body parts of unborn children.  Controversial organizations like Planned Parenthood have no business receiving federal taxpayer dollars. Many states agree ‚Äì it is simply not the job of the federal government to impose regulations like this one to tell those states they‚Äôre wrong. Today‚Äôs action, when passed in the Senate and signed by President Trump, will eliminate that federal wrong and protect state taxpayers from having their money sent against their will to Planned Parenthood.  I look forward to the upcoming Budget Reconciliation bill in the House, which will, in addition to repealing Obamacare, make Planned Parenthood and similar abortion businesses ineligible for federal funding, transferring those funds instead to community health centers that actually focus on health. It is time for government at all levels to end funding for this heinous practice.

One of the greatest abuses of executive power comes in the form of having un-elected bureaucrats creating new government regulations that circumvent the democratic process, cost us American jobs, and restrict our liberty. One of the powers Congress has to rein in abusive regulations is through something called the Congressional Review Act. This law allows Congress to repeal some regulations, and once repealed, bureaucrats are prevented from ever reissuing similar rules without Congressional approval.  Here is a list of the 13 regulations that the House has repealed so far:  1) The Stream Buffer Rule (H.J. Res. 38) would have saddled mines with unnecessary regulations, putting up to 64% of America‚Äôs coal reserves off limits and threatening between 40,000 to 70,000 mining jobs. ‚Äì Signed by President Trump  2) The SEC Disclosure Rule for Resource Extraction (H.J. Res. 41) would have put an unreasonable compliance burden on publicly traded American energy companies, putting them at a disadvantage to foreign-owned businesses. ‚Äì Signed by President Trump  3) The Social Security Service‚Äôs Second Amendment Restrictions (H.J. Res. 40) would increase scrutiny on up to 4.2 million law-abiding disabled Americans attempting to purchase firearms, potentially depriving people of their constitutional rights without proper due process protections. ‚Äì Passed by the Senate  4) The Federal Contracts Blacklisting Rule (H.J. Res. 37) would unjustly block many businesses accused of violating labor laws from federal contracts before they‚Äôve even had a chance to defend themselves in court.  5) The Bureau of Land Management Venting and Flaring Rule (H.J. Res. 36) would further cap methane emissions in the oil and gas industry at a time when the industry is already dramatically reducing emissions, potentially wiping out family-owned marginal wells and costing an estimated $1 billion.  6) The Bureau of Land Management Planning 2.0 Rule (H.J. Res. 44) would reduce local authority over large swaths of land out west, massively expanding the federal government‚Äôs control over more than 175 million acres of land‚Äîabout 4,000 times the size of Washington, D.C.‚Äîin 11 western states.  7) The Teacher Preparation Rule (H.J. Res. 58) would force states to use Washington‚Äôs standards to determine whether a teacher preparation program is effective, undermining local control over education and potentially exacerbating the shortage of special education teachers.  8) The Education Accountability Rule (H.J. Res. 57) would be an unfunded mandate imposing Washington‚Äôs standard for how to assess schools on state and local governments.  9) The Unemployment Insurance Drug Testing Rule (H.J. Res. 42) would severely restrict states‚Äô ability to limit drug abusers from receiving unemployment benefits even if the drug users are not able and available for work, as the law requires.  10) The State Retirement Plan Rule (H.J. Res. 66) would treat employees unequally by allowing states to force some workers into second-tier government-run retirement accounts that lack the same protections as private-sector accounts.  11) The Local Retirement Plan Rule (H.J. Res. 67) would treat employees unequally by allowing certain localities to force some workers into second-tier government-run retirement accounts that lack the same protections as private-sector accounts.  12) The National Wildlife Hunting and Fishing Rule (H.J. Res. 69) would infringe on Alaska‚Äôs right to sustainably manage fish and wildlife by over-regulating hunting‚Äîa move that could set the stage for the federal government to undermine local control across the entire U.S.  13) The Title X Abortion Funding Rule (H.J. Res. 43) would force states to administer Title X health funding to abortion providers, even if states want to redirect those funds to community health centers and hospitals that offer more comprehensive coverage.","status",NA,NA,112,38,35,8,0,0,0,4

On an issue like this, when I share my beliefs sometimes people will respond with ""you have a responsibility to represent all the people, not just some of us."" I agree, but at the same time it is impossible to hold the beliefs that the constitution strictly limits federal power and that the constitution is merely a guideline for governing, at the same time. I have to pick one or the other, and by picking one I am going to make some of you disappointed. That's okay, but in this day in age the origin if your beliefs is even called into question.

My thoughts are as follows:  I believe the First Amendment grants us Freedom OF Religion, not Freedom FROM Religion. To understand why our Founding Fathers specifically outlawed the establishment of an official religion, you need look no further than Great Britain, when the state religion frequently changed based on who occupied the throne, and people of certain religions were prohibited from holding offices and titles. However, the modern day interpretation by some activist judges has greatly diverged from our Founders intent. I wholeheartedly reject the notion that the establishment clause of the Constitution means that God must be driven out of the public square. I also firmly believe that Freedom of Religion does not mean freedom from being offended. We should not shy away from public prayer whether it be at football games, county council meetings, nor should there be a problem with erecting a monument recognizing our Christian heritage. I also fully reject government interference in our churches, and oppose any form of government censorship or intimidation. Past instances of local governments demanding copies of sermons is preposterous, and so is the notion that the state can attempt to force people or businesses into violating certain religious beliefs like in the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court case.","status",NA,NA,171,105,28,29,0,0,1,9

I believe that President Trump inherited a mess. Let‚Äôs begin with our nation's debt. For almost thirty years, America has been on a spending binge that has resulted in over $20 trillion in national (on balance sheet) debt. This situation, even after President Clinton and the Newt Gingrich House agreed on a balanced budget, welfare reform, and experienced surpluses, will cause America to max out its borrowing ability late this spring and will, yet again, raise that debt limit in order to stave off talk of a default.  Ask yourself - what is driving our nation's spending? It isn't military spending - although the prosecution of a ""War on Terror"" has added to the debt since America did not cut spending in other areas as a ""pay for."" Military spending, due to sequester and priorities of the Obama Administration, has gone down - to the detriment of our readiness. But those who will bash any spending on our fights against Al Qaeda or ISIS (after we were attacked on 9/11) would be wise to also look at the spending the U.S. has undertaken in the ""War on Poverty.""  We need to look at the results of the ‚ÄúWar on Poverty‚Äù and its spending as it relates to raising, or failing to raise, the populace out of poverty. These spending categories have attributed to much of the U.S. ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù spending.  What will we do about our debt and spending?  True unemployment is way too high in this nation - when one looks at the current labor participation rates vs. historical figures. The bottom line is that too many Americans are out of work and too many rely on some form of government subsistence. The other factor in this equation is that they, in turn, are not paying any taxes other than consumption tax. In fact, many are receiving an EIC check this year at tax filing.  Speaking of military spending: our military, all branches, are at historical low numbers - as are our ships, planes, and battlefield-ready equipment. In order to return to a state of readiness, America will need to spend money.  The federal government grew under the last administration both in personnel and in regulations.  On another note, we have no idea who has entered our country since we have not controlled our borders (the main source of illegal crossings have been from the south).  ""A nation which cannot control its borders is not a nation."" - President Ronald Reagan.  Securing our nation means securing our southern border. Reagan spoke of a Shining City on a Hill. But he also said, ""If that city has walls, it should also have gates - to allow normal commerce as well as legal immigration.""  The Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as ""Obamacare,"" is a failure. Americans have seen rates increase, deductibles increase, and out of pocket maximums increase. All of these increases are in exchange for worse coverage than people have historically been accustomed to.  Insurance companies have folded and/or fled certain markets (South Carolina has only one insurer on the exchange). In addition, Americans are finding that the health coverage they are paying for is less accessible and individual than what we have historically benefited from.  Inflation exists, even though nobody is talking about it. Yes, interest rates for borrowers are currently low. But, you must admit, American consumers are paying more for everything from milk, bread and meat, to new automobiles. With taxes (at all levels - local, state, and federal) going up, Americans have less money for college savings, savings in general, or discretionary spending.  Just some thoughts as I travel today.

I understand not clapping on policy differences uttered during the address. Been there, done that. Didn't clap when President Obama mentioned policy positions I disagreed with.  But we (Republican Members of Congress) did clap when President Obama entered (and when his wife was recognized too, btw) as that shows respect for the Office of the President of the United States. Like it or not Donald Trump currently occupies that office.  The second most disturbing thing witnessed in person was the failure of certain key Democrats to stand in honor of a fallen American soldier (and the US military in general) when the wife that fallen hero was recognized. That was shameful IMHO.  President Trump's speech was filled with a lot of pro-American rhetoric. His best line was about not being elected to represent the world - he was elected to represent America.  Seems we will finally focus on putting America and American interests first. But the Democrats in Congress wouldn't even stand for America. I imagine that they would have emulated Colin Kaepernick had the National Anthem been struck up at that moment - based on how they were reacting.  President Trump spoke about American jobs, American workers and how having the economy flourishing, like a rising tide raises all boats, raises all Americans. The Minority party in the halls of Congress failed to applaud even that positive position.

We will likely see many changes to the bill as it works its way through the committee process, but I wanted to write some technical posts about specific aspects of the bill that I've discovered and gather your feedback.  As written, this bill includes protections to prevent people from being denied coverage for pre-existing conditions. Here's the rub, if people can't be denied coverage for having a pre-existing then what is stop someone from buying insurance only after they get sick? The answer? Nothing. That can and will happen. This is a problem because if people only buy insurance after they are sick, then it ceases to be insurance. Rates for everyone will go up, insurers will reduce what they cover, and people will have fewer plans to choose from.  Under ObamaCare, the solution to that problem was force everyone to buy insurance, something that was called the individual mandate. I think that's wrong. The federal government should not have the right to force you to buy something. To make matters worse, ObamaCare took away many people's insurance plans and eliminated inexpensive catastrophic plans that were a great choice for many Americans.  The Republican leadership backed bill addresses this problem in a different way. There is no individual mandate, but if you choose to go without insurance for a certain period of time, insurance companies are allowed to charge you a 30% surcharge for going uninsured. I am still trying to determine how long that 30% increase can be charged. Keep in mind that by reinstating cheaper insurance options, it will be easier for people to have some type of insurance like the catastrophic plans I discussed earlier.  Here is my question for you: For the sake of discussion please limit your responses to answering these questions. 1) Should the healthcare bill cover pre-existing conditions? If not, why not? 2) If you answered yes to the first question, do you support the idea of a potential 30% surcharge? If not, why not, and what is your solution to ensuring that people don't only buy insurance after they have been diagnosed with a major illness.

AAN is the same group who has previously run ads supporting illegal immigration and open borders. In the past, they‚Äôve run TV ads against my conservative colleagues (Tim Huelskamp, Jim Bridenstine, Jim Jordan, and Mick Mulvaney).  I‚Äôve been studying the details of the recently released Republican bill and have been soliciting feedback from constituents on specific provisions. My biggest concern thus far is that the current plan falls short of the promise we made to fully repeal Obamacare. The current bill leaves large portions of that law intact, including some of the taxes. Senator Paul is calling this ‚ÄúObamacare Lite.‚Äù I‚Äôve also heard it called ‚ÄúObamacare 2.0‚Äù and ‚ÄúObamacare Repair.‚Äù Any way you cut it, it is difficult to say that this is the repeal bill that millions of Americans have been hoping for.   I‚Äôm not saying just to go back to how things were before ‚Äì those policies weren‚Äôt good enough.  Health care was too expensive then, but it has only gotten worse post-Obamacare. I‚Äôm willing to work with my colleagues on a free-market based replacement that lowers costs (not just insurance costs but health care costs). I‚Äôm a cosponsor of the Sanford/Paul bill that expands Health Savings Accounts and allows for Association Health Plans and sales across state lines. I think that‚Äôs a good starting point.   I‚Äôm still studying the bill, including the various changes that were made in committees over the past few days. I‚Äôm hopeful that we will see many more changes before the bill gets to the House floor. It is quite possible that if the Phase II or Phase III parts of this health care rollout that President Trump has mentioned were included in this bill, that I may have a different opinion on the overall legislation. I believe the President is being receptive to the concerns of conservatives, and I am hopeful those concerns will be reflected in a final bill.    I‚Äôm not alone in thinking this ‚Äì Senators Paul, Lee, Cruz, and Cotton are saying the same thing ‚Äì and they‚Äôre saying they won‚Äôt support the bill as written. That means this bill has no chance of passing in the Senate without major changes. House Leadership has long ‚Äúpre-conferenced‚Äù bills with the Senate, a phrase used to describe negotiating the framework of a bill before it gets to the floor. If ever there was a time to pre-conference a bill with Senators, it‚Äôs this bill with those 4 Senators.  As this debate moves forward, I‚Äôm reminded of something my friend, then-Congressman, now Vice-President Mike Pence said in 2003 during the Medicare Part D debate: ""That's too expensive a gamble for principled Conservatives. We simply didn't come here to increase entitlements and to create bigger government. We came here to make government smaller.""  That rings true today as well.","status",NA,NA,213,170,55,12,1,0,4,18

So far I've outlined some of my concerns with the House GOP bill, and wrote a post specifically on the section dealing with pre-existing conditions. In this post I hope to explain the ""process"" arguments for and against the bill, and gather your feedback.  One concern I have about this healthcare debate is I keep hearing from people who hate ObamaCare, but also oppose the House GOP bill. When I try to dig deeper into why people oppose the House bill, I'm not getting very specific answers. This tells me that Republicans (myself included) need to do a better job explaining what is and what is not in this bill. Without people being able to specifically tell me what is wrong with the bill, it's difficult to know where the goal posts are in making this a bill that people can support. I have a pretty good idea of what kinds of changes I want to see in this bill, but I want to know where the people are in this process.  The process we are using to repeal ObamaCare is called budget reconciliation. Reconciliation eliminates Senate Democrats ability to filibuster the bill and allows legislation to pass with 50 votes (assuming the Vice President breaks the tie) in the Senate. This is extremely important to remember since Senate Republicans only have a 52 vote majority in the Senate, significantly smaller than the majority Democrats had in 2009. Secondly, it's important to know that reconciliation does have some limits as to what it can accomplish. It is primarily a budget tool, and is not designed for major legislating. However, since reconciliation is the process Democrats used to help enact ObamaCare, it is entirely appropriate that we use it repeal the law. Reconciliation can allow us to repeal 90% or more of ObamaCare but not the entire law. If you want to see how much can be repealed using reconciliation look at the bill Congress passed in 2015 that President Obama vetoed. Third, in order for reconciliation to work, the bill has to save the taxpayers money. This is easier to do in reality than it is on paper due to restrictions concerning the budgetary process. For example, ObamaCare is filled with over $500 billion in tax increases. For budgetary purposes, every time we repeal a tax increase that is a ""cost"" to the government. This is extremely important to remember when you start hearing statistics on the ""cost"" of this bill, verses the ""cost"" of ObamaCare, but it also makes repeal tricky.  Examining the House GOP bill, you will find that it repeals less than the reconciliation bill in 2015, but why? I believe the reason is because House Republicans are trying to use reconciliation to both repeal AND replace ObamaCare, instead of just repeal.  The White House and House of Representatives strategy is a three phase approach. Phase I is the House GOP bill, Phase II is regulatory reform, Phase III is additional legislation. The White House and GOP leadership only have confidence in being able to implement Phase I & II. In my opinion, the House GOP bill was written to be self sustaining in the event Phase III never happens. Unfortunately, Phase III has a lot of the reforms that conservatives like such as expanded HSAs, selling across state lines, and association healthcare plans.  I know this is extremely complicated, so let me explain it another way. Using reconciliation to repeal AND replace ObamaCare is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. It involves strategically repealing large parts of ObamaCare, but using the hull of the law to implement conservative reforms. Then Sec. Tom Price uses the broad authority granted to him under the parts of ObamaCare that you don't repeal to smooth out the edges and make reform possible.  My preference would be to pass the 2015 reconciliation bill that repeals most of ObamaCare. Once the law is off the books, we then move forward on a replacement bill even though that bill would require 60 votes. At that point, Democrats can either join Republicans in supporting an overhaul to free-market based healthcare or they can be responsible for things going back to way they were before ObamaCare.

Rep. Jeff Duncan / March 15, 2017  President Ronald Reagan once said, ‚ÄúWe should carry a banner of no pale pastels‚Äîbut one of bold colors, which make it unmistakably clear where we stand on the issues.‚Äù  The 2010 mid-term elections were historic. Running opposite of President Barack Obama‚Äôs agenda‚Äîprimarily the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare‚Äîthe Republican efforts resulted in 63 seats changing hands, the highest loss of a party in a House mid-term election since 1938 and the largest House swing from one party to the other since 1948. Americans were angry with the Democrats‚Äô efforts on health care reform, feeling hoodwinked by a 1,400-page bill crafted in such a fashion that members of Congress were urged to ‚Äúpass [it] so we can find out what is in it,‚Äù as then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is remembered for saying.  After four years of further Democratic control of the Senate, Republicans were able to wrest control in the 2014 mid-term elections from Majority Leader Harry Reid, keeping it for the remaining two years of Obama‚Äôs term.  Republicans would finally be able to send some legislation to the president‚Äôs desk. The big target? Obamacare.  The Full Repeal  In order to send an Obamacare repeal bill to the president‚Äôs desk with only a 54-46 Senate majority, congressional Republicans had to use a budgetary tactic known as budget reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority of votes in the Senate (51) in order to pass. (This is the same method Democrats had to use to pass the bulk of Obamacare in 2010.)  The Restoring Americans‚Äô Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015 (H.R. 3762) was the reconciliation legislation for fiscal year 2016, and the vehicle used to repeal Obamacare. Predictably, Obama vetoed the bill on Jan. 8, 2016.  During the presidential election cycle in 2016, Republicans were once again given the nod by the nation by retaining the majority in the House of Representatives, keeping a 52-48 majority in the Senate, and winning the White House with the election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president of the United States.  Obamacare was once again in the crosshairs of the Republican majority.  The New Plan  Now, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hope to use the budget reconciliation tactic to once again overcome the Democrats‚Äô ability to filibuster general legislation in the Senate.  On the evening of March 6, House leadership rolled out the American Health Care Act, a reconciliation bill aimed at making changes to Obamacare. Many have dubbed the bill ‚ÄúObamacare Lite‚Äù since it does not repeal the Affordable Care Act, but instead nibbles around the edges in an attempt to make Obamacare less harmful.  House leadership promises a multi-pronged legislative process involving three phases: Phase I, the reconciliation bill, Phase II, the top-down repeal of regulations by Secretary Tom Price at the Department of Health and Human Services, and Phase III, additional bills that will make the necessary reforms to how insurance is sold across America.  The problem with Phase III, as many conservatives like Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., have pointed out, is that it will be a general bill that requires 60 votes to pass in the Senate.  This is a heavy lift for Senate Republicans and a deal-making president, who will need to win over eight Democratic senators to pass such legislation.  What the House Bill Does (And Doesn‚Äôt Do)  First and foremost, the American Health Care Act does not repeal Obamacare. The bill does repeal some facets of Obamacare, and there are some things to like about the bill. These include: ‚Ä¢ Defunding of Planned Parenthood, something Republicans should have already been able to do. ‚Ä¢ Repeal of the individual mandate, which requires everyone to purchase health insurance or pay a gradually increasing fine. ‚Ä¢ Repeal of the employer mandate, which subsequently changes the definition of full-time employment. ‚Ä¢ Repeal of the medical device tax and other taxes on health insurance premiums and pharmaceuticals, while increasing the expense threshold for medical expense deductions. ‚Ä¢ Ending the Medicaid expansion after three years. ‚Ä¢ Repeal of the government subsidy for health insurance premiums.  These are good things that were all included in the 2015 budget reconciliation bill, which passed both houses of Congress. The American Health Care Act also repeals the individual mandate that requires everyone to have health insurance or pay a gradually increasing tax. But the House GOP plan replaces the individual mandate with its own penalty‚Äîa 30 percent penalty to the insurer if there is a lapse in coverage.  In essence, this is requiring people to have health insurance or risk paying more when they do obtain it. The penalty will just be retained by the insurance companies instead of being collected by the government in the Obamacare tax.  We Can Do Better  The biggest question to ask ourselves is: Is this the best that we can do? And, is this bill what Americans expected Republicans to do with their control of government? Is this the bold effort so many across America have expected?  Is this the bill on which, while campaigning on the repeal of Obamacare in 2010, Republicans pinned their hopes of winning the majority in the House? Is this what ‚Äúdraining the swamp‚Äù looks like? As written, is this the bill that enabled candidates like former Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Fla., to capture that Panama City House seat for Republicans for the first time since 1882? As written, is this the bill that compelled the people in South Carolina‚Äôs 5th congressional district to elect Rep. Mick Mulvaney (now a key Trump Cabinet official) over incumbent Democrat and Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt?  Is the bill put forth by Speaker Ryan the bill that 400,000+ patriotic Americans flooded Capitol Hill to push for at the Tea Party rally in 2009? Is the language in this bill what Republicans had in mind when they embraced the 2010 Pledge to America, which promised the repeal of Obamacare?  And lastly, is the current language in the bill what Republicans were fighting for in 2013 when the government shut down for 16 days during the Continuing Resolution fight over Obamacare? I ran for Congress on repealing Obamacare. Not nibbling around the edges. Not exchanging one mandate for another.  I ran to unwind government, limit the size and scope of government, and unleash the things that make America great. One of the most powerful institutions that has built this country is the free market. Capitalism.  Government has no business being in health care or the health insurance business. We have allowed safety-net programs like Medicaid and Medicare to become big bureaucratic nightmares that restrict choice, dictate terms, and mandate coverage‚Äîenforced with a carrot-and-stick mentality and funded by the tax dollars of hard-working Americans.  Medicaid and Medicare are no longer safety-net programs. They have become the health insurance for many Americans. These programs entangle the federal government (with its money), the states (who run Medicaid programs), and hospitals and doctors who must comply with bureaucratic mandates, which are often crafted by people with little to no understanding of the doctor-patient relationship, medical diagnoses, or treatments.  Betraying Our Voters  Is this the set of policies the American people expected when Trump ran in 2016 on the repeal of Obamacare? How do you think they will react when these are the only parts of repeal that pass because some members of Congress cannot sell free markets and less government back in their districts?  I believe they will feel betrayed. That is why the bill that House Leadership has introduced, in its current form, is not one that I can support.  That doesn‚Äôt mean that I will vote No on the final package. We don‚Äôt know what that is going to look like yet. There are enough conservative members like me who have the same problems with the current language of the bill to push for substantial changes. Negotiations remain ongoing, including those between House and Senate conservatives, House and Senate leadership, as well as with the White House.  I believe that the House Rules Committee may present us with a ‚ÄúManager‚Äôs Amendment‚Äù‚Äîone that seeks to address our concerns‚Äîto the final bill. My hope is that we, along with the American public, get a good chance to study that text before we vote on it, thus avoiding a Pelosiesque moment and fulfilling our promise of transparency to the American people.  This is a defining moment in our own rendezvous with destiny, and we owe it to the American people to get it right.","status",NA,NA,103,39,17,4,0,0,0,2

These rulings out of Hawaii and Maryland are the embodiment of liberal judicial activism at their worst. The President‚Äôs executive order paused refugees and visa issuance to people from 6 Middle East/North African countries.  The Law is clear on this matter. The statute is clear, and has been used by Presidents from Carter forward, just as Congress intended. The six countries President Trump listed are the same as the six countries President Obama listed as terrorist safe havens ‚Äì they don‚Äôt have the necessary records that would allow for vetting, they don‚Äôt cooperate with our immigration officials, and they have embedded terrorist populations.  If this were a Muslim ban, why weren‚Äôt Indonesia, Pakistan or India listed? They‚Äôre the three largest Muslim populations in the world, and yet they weren‚Äôt included. This clearly isn‚Äôt a Muslim ban. The countries listed have Islamic State terrorists, and we take ISIS at it‚Äôs word. They‚Äôve said they will infiltrate our refugee and visa programs, to send fighters to do American citizens harm. These are the countries where ISIS has been harbored.  Countries that do cooperate with the US weren‚Äôt listed. After great work by Secretary Tillerson, Iraq stepped up their visa and refugee application process, so they aren‚Äôt listed in the ban any more, as they were in the prior order. This shows that the process is working.  Yet, this Obama-nominated judge in Hawaii steps in, when he has no authority, where Congress and the Constitution have clearly empowered the President to make these decisions in the national security interest. When Judge Watson cites political rhetoric in his decision, not the statute or the law, this is judicial activism at its very worst. It‚Äôs tyranny from the bench, or ‚Äúblack-robed tyranny‚Äù as conservative pundits have called it in years past.  President Trump has vowed to fight this all the way to the Supreme Court. I hope he does. An Administration victory is a win for American national security and sovereignty. I also hope we will pursue impeaching this terrible judge for overstepping his authority against national security, the law and the Constitution.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepJeffDuncan/videos/1595769953774084/",NA,2855,785,4905,248,0,31,3,57

These are things that Conservatives and, anyone - including the White House - should get behind:  Wall Street Journal: Three Criteria for Health Reform The House repeal-and-replace plan doesn‚Äôt go far enough. By Ted Cruz and Mark Meadows  Republicans have a historic opportunity to follow through on our promise to repeal ObamaCare. The recent elections that focused on the law‚Äôs repeal‚Äî2010, 2014 and 2016‚Äîwere massive GOP victories. The American people gave our party unified control of the federal government, and a mandate for meaningful change.  After years of talk, we know that the Republican repeal-and-replace effort will soon be judged by three criteria: Does it make health care more affordable? Does it give consumers more choices? Does it provide Americans more control over their families‚Äô health care?  As of now, the House‚Äôs bill neither fully repeals ObamaCare nor passes these three tests. Yet there‚Äôs a path forward‚Äîif the administration and Republicans from across the political spectrum can put aside past differences to find consensus. Here is how we propose the House and Senate come together to do just that:  First, we must lower insurance premiums. Nothing matters more. The current House bill would not achieve this, because it doesn‚Äôt repeal all of ObamaCare‚Äôs insurance mandates. Of the few it addresses, the bill delays their repeal. We must abolish ObamaCare‚Äôs mandates immediately; Americans need relief from higher premiums and cannot wait until 2020 or beyond.  The single biggest factor causing frustration with ObamaCare is skyrocketing costs. The average family‚Äôs annual premiums on employer-sponsored plans under the law have increased by more than $5,000. The insurance mandates are a primary driver of these spikes. If we leave these mandates in place or delay their repeal, premiums will remain too high for too long, as studies by the Congressional Budget Office and others have shown. If premiums continue to skyrocket, we will have failed, and Americans will rightly direct their frustration at the ballot box toward the Republican majority.  We cannot give voters a procedural excuse for why we couldn‚Äôt get the job done. Some have argued, incorrectly, that the Senate‚Äôs Byrd Rule precludes repealing these insurance mandates through the reconciliation process. That simply isn‚Äôt true. The current version of the bill already repeals or modifies a few of the mandates. Why wouldn‚Äôt we repeal all the major insurance mandates for the sake of truly lower health-care costs? How can modifying a mandate comply with Byrd, but repealing it not comply? Both have billions in budgetary effect, the central prerequisite for reconciliation.  We should follow the text of the Budget Act, which establishes the reconciliation process. Fully repealing the insurance mandates would comply with both the letter and the spirit of the statute. More important, the Senate parliamentarian does not ultimately determine what is allowable under reconciliation. That authority falls to the Senate and the vice president, the chamber‚Äôs presiding officer. As the former Senate parliamentarian Robert Dove once explained, the vice president is ‚Äúthe ultimate decider‚Äù on reconciliation: ‚ÄúThe parliamentarian only can advise. It is the vice president who rules.‚Äù  To further lower premiums, we should allow families to pay for health insurance from expanded health savings accounts. Allowing premium payments from HSAs would reduce costs, provide greater parity between employer and individual coverage, and encourage insurance portability, which also directly addresses concerns related to pre-existing conditions.  We should also include in the reconciliation bill additional reforms that will drive down costs: Consumers should be enabled to purchase insurance plans across state lines to create a true 50-state marketplace. Small businesses should be allowed to pool together in association plans to get better rates for their employees.  Second, we shouldn‚Äôt replace ObamaCare‚Äôs subsidies with yet another health-care entitlement. Instead, we should implement nonrefundable tax credits, which can be deducted from payroll taxes for lower earners. Anyone who gets a paycheck has a large amount withheld by payroll taxes. Thus, this nonrefundable credit would benefit lower-income individuals by letting them keep more of what they earn.  Third, ObamaCare‚Äôs Medicaid expansion should be immediately frozen and then phased out over time. A freeze wouldn‚Äôt take away coverage from any person currently enrolled‚Äîit wouldn‚Äôt pull the rug out from anybody‚Äîbut it would prevent states from adding more enrollees to the expansion population, which the federal government would be responsible for funding.  During the phaseout, we should implement work requirements for healthy working-age adults in the Medicaid expansion population. ObamaCare overextended Medicaid beyond those people that the program was intended to serve‚Äîthe disabled elderly, pregnant women and needy children. Too often now, these people and their families have been forced onto waiting lists while money has poured into the expansion population. Freezing ObamaCare‚Äôs expansion immediately will stop this misdirection of the Medicaid program without taking away anyone‚Äôs coverage.  We should also implement true Medicaid block grants to the states. Republicans understand that in its current form, Medicaid does not work well. Much of the dysfunction is the result of one-size-fits-all federal rules that are forced on every state. Instead of per capita caps with federal strings still attached, we should allow states to innovate to help produce better health results. That‚Äôs why the reconciliation bill should include true block grants for Medicaid funding, which actually would allow states to transform their Medicaid programs and better serve vulnerable populations, without having to ask ‚ÄúMother, may I‚Äù of the federal government.  In any case, a comprehensive plan to reform Medicaid must restrain the program‚Äôs growth rate if it is to be fiscally responsible in the long term and not allow for out-of-control spending.  Republicans have pledged for six years to repeal ObamaCare and return choice to America‚Äôs health-care system. The time to act is now upon us. If Republicans join together with united purpose and tackle these areas of concern, we will have finally delivered on our promise.  Mr. Cruz, a Texas Republican, is a U.S. senator. Mr. Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, is chairman of the House Freedom Caucus.","status",NA,NA,97,64,33,3,0,0,0,3

I passionately described our generation's rendezvous with destiny - a real chance to roll back the size and scope of the federal government, returning some liberty back to the people through our actions to repeal Obamacare.  Leadership has crafted this bill in such a way that, in their eyes, will meet the Byrd Rule in the Senate - a rule that dictates whether the components of the bill have budgetary impact. The determination of that budgetary impact lies with an unelected, appointed Parliamentarian in the Senate.   If we were to go Big and Bold - truly repealing Obamacare, all of the regulations and including the reforms which would allow the free market to create insurance products to meet the needs of Americans all across the spectrum - from the most needy to the most wealthy and healthy - the House leadership and their advisors believe that the Parliamentarian would rule the bill out of order.  Here lies the challenge:  the Presiding Officer in the Senate (in this case, most assuredly, would be the Vice President) could overrule the Parliamentarian.   In fact, As the former Senate parliamentarian Robert Dove once explained, the Vice President is ‚Äúthe ultimate decider‚Äù on reconciliation: ‚ÄúThe parliamentarian only can advise. It is the vice president who rules.‚Äù  Republicans were given the power to govern. But we seem afraid to take on a Senate staff member (the Parliamentarian) at a critical time in United States history.  As I told the VP and Conference:  the Democrats were willing to change a rule (the nuclear option by Harry Reid) and even alter the makeup of the United States Supreme Court (FDR) in order to push through the progressive policies which have been destroying America. We (Republicans) aren't even willing to take on a lady in the Senate or change the rules in order to SAVE America!  If we truly believe, and I do, that Obamacare is harming America and American businesses - that this progressive policy is wrong on the fronts of being too much government, unconstitutional taxes and doing irreparable harm to our health care delivery systems - we should be willing to crawl on our hands and knees across broken glass even - whatever it takes - to repeal this bill and live up to the promises we have made to those Americans who entrusted us with this opportunity.  Instead, we are running scared of an unelected advisor.  Yeah - I am passionate about my beliefs about government, The Constitution and liberty of Americans. I will never apologize for that.

Phase II: nobody questions whether Secretary Price will do everything in his power to roll back Obamacare through his abilities at HHS. He is an honorable man whom we all (Conservatives and Moderates alike) trust. But the courts WILL get involved to hamper his efforts.  Phase III: the House will pass a series of stand-alone reform bills that never get taken up in the Senate. Then, these bills will be added as ""Sweeteners"" to must-pass legislation like a debt ceiling increase - and Members will vote to raise the debt ceiling in order to enact the reforms to the health care marketplaces which will drive premiums down and provide greater choices. They will be added to the big spending infrastructure bill that may or may not include (real) spending offsets and which President Trump has made a priority of his first 100 days.  Phase III bill's which we all want will force Members to vote for things they otherwise wouldn't support - and which they may have told the voters they would never vote to do.  It's coming.

What is that you ask?  Obamacare gave the Secretary (Kathleen Sibelius at the time) the power to define essential health benefits which must be covered in all insurance plans sold in the exchanges, small group plans and government plans REGARDLESS of Costs.   In essence, the consumer had to buy a plan which covered things they would never use.  A single male, for instance, would still be paying for maternity and newborn care in his policy. Parents of adolescent children would still be paying for Pediatric services.    The marketplace could not create plans to meet the needs of the different consumers and thus keep costs down while also offering plans for those newlyweds hoping to start a family or the parents of young children. The government said what insurance companies had to cover with EHB's. That was/is a driver of high premiums.  The repeal of the Essential Health Benefit language is a good improvement.

However, our colleagues over on the Senate side disagree and are continuing to encourage us to add as many of these provisions as possible. Some of us suspect that the real reason these provisions have been left in the bill is because they are supported by moderate ""Tuesday Group"" Republicans in the House. We're continuing to do everything we can to fight for the best bill possible, and then give Senate conservatives their chance to push for more changes to the bill before it comes back to the House for a final vote.  I would also like to say how impressed I have been with both President Trump and Vice President Pence throughout this entire process. With them I feel like we have a receptive and gracious negotiating partner who wants to work with us to make this a better bill. Without the leadership of President Trump, this bill likely would have died weeks ago. Will continue to keep you updated as things develop.","status",NA,NA,200,93,33,10,0,0,0,7

There was never, nor is there, a deadline.   Government doesn't shutdown.  We don't default on our debt. And we didn't start a war.   A bill, arguably poorly crafted and horribly constrained by Senate rules, was not voted on. Period.  It didn't fail. It just didn't get voted on. And may not get voted on.  But at the end of the day - other than the high stakes in the blood sport of politics - nothing has changed other than an effort failed in a legislative body and there are lessons to learn.   The first lesson is for House leadership going forward. When drafting legislation, you gather consensus. You don't leave members of the Republican Conference  in the dark. Everything we do, we do as a team. People will be quick to blame the House Freedom Caucus, but I'd point out that Paul Ryan never included the Freedom Caucus when drafting this bill.   From the beginning, this bill was worked backwards. Good bills should be worked forwards.  I also hope that the Trump Administration will engage more on the front-end as well.  I understand that, while House leaders were crafting this bill, the Trump Administration was still setting up shop.   But we can get a better bill with their active engagement should they choose to continue. They may not - and, indeed, move on to other things on their agenda.   But as the flaring tensions subside all around, I hope people will realize the points made in the opening paragraph here.  And your elected Legislative and Executive Branches will get back to work to truly bring forth a bill which more adequately reflects the will of those we represent.  Repeal of Obamacare is an immensely important step to get our nation back on track, empower individuals, help small businesses and restore federalism. We will get it done.  But there are other important issues coming as well.   An appropriations bill. A debt ceiling increase.  An infrastructure bill. Re-Authorization bills for government programs.  I commit to you, my constituents and followers on social media, that I will continue to provide you with real-time and accurate (as best I can) information on what is happening in the US House of Representatives. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to be in this fight on your behalf. You didn't elect a sheep who blindly follows.

(BTW - the 2015 Reconciliation Bill sent to President Obama's desk didn't repeal Obamacare - that is a misconception).  We can.  And - there are bills out there to do just that!  I am a cosponsor of the Rand Paul bill carried in the House by Mark Sanford.  Here is the problem:  general legislative bills must get 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster.  Republicans have 54 votes. That is why House is trying to do as much as possible within the contraints of the budget reconciliation bill, a bill that is only available once a year (to reconcile the annual budget) and which must only deal with budgetary matters.  And ""de-funding"" things like Planned Parenthood"" in an annual bill like this would only last for one-year, I believe.  (I do know this bill only applied to PP for one year.)  So, Planned Parenthood would only lose funding for one year (but think about how many babies we could save in one year!).  It is near impossible to include policy changes in the reconciliation bill or it fails the rules-test and ultimately kills the bill - as well as the only chance in this fiscal year to begin dismantling Obamacare.  Remember: Pelosi's democrats ended up having to use reconciliation as the vehicle to pass Obamacare because, when Scott Brown was elected, they no longer had 60 votes in the Senate.  House Conservatives were pushing leadership to put as much as possible in the reconciliation bill; House moderates were pushing to limit what was there - thus creating a fine line for the required number of votes.  Speaker Ryan made the right call to cancel the vote - because if it failed, that reconciliation vehicle would die for the year, this ending any chance to craft a better bill and get another crack at moving it to the Senate.  Hope that helps.","status",NA,NA,159,118,53,3,2,0,1,2

I have no expectation that people will always agree with me, but it's disappointing when I see an attack insinuating that those beliefs are some how motivated by money.  Below is a list of a few of the political donations made by Planned Parenthood over the past two years. While I have been very clear that I believe Planned Parenthood is a morally bankrupt organization, I do not believe that any of the politicians on this list are ""pro-abortion"" because they have received contributions from Planned Parenthood. As a staunch pro-life advocate, I am willing to say that these individuals receive support from this organization because of their deeply held pro-abortion convictions. I think their opinion is dead wrong, but I don't question their sincerity in believing it. If I didn't hold that view, not only would I never work with any of them on an issue, but I would want them arrested.  We can agree to disagree on the issues, but its disrespectful to make unfounded accusations that a persons deeply held convictions are commodities to be bought.

The Court justified the Maduro power grab on the argument that the National Assembly were ""in a situation of contempt""....  As the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs' Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, I have been following these developments closely. Americans should pay close attention to the situation in Venezuela--especially the Americans who have sympathized with the socialist takeover of the country since Hugo Chavez. The media doesn't want to call this out directly (they instead say ""government mismanagement"" of the economy) but, government and political control over the economy is directly and inherently responsible for the severity of the humanitarian crisis. Price controls hit market reality when oil prices tanked--the government's largest source of revenue. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world (and amazingly has a gas shortage). Instead of allowing for the free market to guide supply and demand (and therefore prices) the politicians decided the key to preserve their positions of power was to impose government control over these market price setting mechanisms. They staked their political claim as being ""for the people"". The saying ""the road to hell is paved with good intentions,"" comes to mind.  As oil prices collapsed, the government's leading source of revenue (and, critically, access to foreign currency needed for imports) disappeared. They must use foreign currency to import many goods because government control of industry has largely destroyed domestic production. Last fall, food prices skyrocketed after the government was forced to ease price control enforcement due to food shortage. Producers simply couldn't keep business operating because they operated at a loss. As price controls were relaxed, food returned to the shelves but at such high prices, no one could afford them. The government increased the pumping of money into circulation in a vain attempt to offset inflation, and then returned to price controls to balance the rise in price--creating a massive food shortage (for example, 90% of all flour provided to bakeries by the government must be used to make bread sold at artificially capped prices).   Now, the currency is in a free fall and so worthless they can't import enough basic food products to feed their people. The food shortage has become so severe that it has led to Venezuelans killing flamingos, anteaters, and even zoo animals for food in desperation. This vicious cycle is exactly why the government should not be involved in the market. Inflation is expected to rise to 1,660% this year and 2,880% in 2018 according to the IMF.  Because the Maduro government is on the ropes, they are now fighting to eliminate all opposing political institutions. In fact, they have propagandized this as an ""economic war"" organized by the opposition, going so far as to arrest bakers for selling goods they claim is composed of more than 90% wheat...  Below is from my initial press release:  The blatantly unconstitutional move by Venezuela‚Äôs Supreme Court should finally get the attention of the world. The Organization of American States (OAS) Secretary General has provided repeated documentation of President Maduro‚Äôs tyrannical abuses of power. At what point will the countries of the Americas wake up to the fact that Venezuela has sadly become not only a practically failed state because of Maduro‚Äôs policies but a dictatorship that refuses to submit to the will of the Venezuelan citizens? The United States stands in solidarity with the Venezuelan people, and I strongly urge our friends in the region to condemn Maduro‚Äôs actions and consider immediate suspension of Venezuela from the OAS. I also urge the Trump Administration to increase targeted sanctions on the individuals responsible for this breach of power.","link","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKBN1721P8","reuters.com",23,24,27,1,0,2,9,1

Be safe and don't take unnecessary risks!  Preparedness Download the FEMA mobile app to set up alerts for the latest weather updates, shelter information, disaster resources, preparedness information, and safety tips, in English and in Spanish.  The app provides a customizable checklist of emergency supplies, maps of open shelters and recovery centers, disaster survival tips, and weather alerts from the National Weather Service.  The app also enables users to receive push notifications reminding them to take important steps to prepare their homes and families for disasters.    Pre-Tornado It is important to get familiar with the terms that are used to identify severe weather and discuss with your family what to do if a watch or warning is issued.  o   A Severe Thunderstorm Watch is issued when severe thunderstorms are possible in and near the watch area. o   A Severe Thunderstorm Warning is issued when severe thunderstorms are occurring or imminent in the warning area. o   A Tornado Watch is issued when severe thunderstorms and tornadoes are possible in and near the watch area.  It does not mean that they will occur.  It only means they are possible. o   A Tornado Warning means thunderstorms with a tornado is imminent, take shelter immediately. o   A Tornado Emergency is issued when severe threat to human life and catastrophic damage is imminent or ongoing, and reliable sources confirm a tornado. o   A High Wind Watch is issued when sustained winds of at least 40 MPH or when wind gusts of 58 MPH or higher are possible for one hour or more.  o   A High Wind Warning is issued when sustained wind speeds of at least 40 MPH or gusts of 58 MPH or more is expected or occurring. o   A Wind Advisory is issued when sustained winds of at least 31 MPH or wind gusts of 46 MPH or more are expected.    o    Storm cellars or basements provide the best protection. o    If underground shelter is not available, go to an interior room or hallway on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. o    Put as many walls as possible between you and the outside.  Most injuries associated with high winds are from flying debris, so remember to protect your head. o    Vehicles, trailers and mobile homes are not good locations to ride out a tornado.  Plan to go quickly to a building with a strong foundation, if possible. o    If shelter is not available, lie flat in a ditch or other low-lying area.  Do not get under an overpass or bridge.  You are safer in a low, flat location. o    Plan to stay in the shelter location until the danger has passed.   Post-Tornado Only enter areas that have sustained damaged after local officials have said it is safe to do so.  Always follow the direction of local officials.   Because tornadoes often damage power lines, gas lines or electrical systems, there is a risk of fire, electrocution or an explosion.   Here are some safety precautions that could help you avoid injury after a tornado:  o   Be careful when entering any structure that has been damaged. o   Wear sturdy shoes or boots, long sleeves and gloves when handling or walking on or near debris. o   Do not touch downed power lines or objects in contact with downed lines.  Report electrical hazards to the police and the utility company. o   Use battery-powered lanterns, if possible, rather than candles to light homes without electrical power.    Inspecting the damage:  o   After a tornado, be aware of possible structural, electrical or gas-leak hazards in your home.  o   In general, if you suspect any damage to your home, shut off electrical power, natural gas and propane tanks to avoid fire, electrocution or explosions if you know how to do so. o   If it is dark when you are inspecting your home, use a flashlight rather than a candle or torch to avoid the risk of fire or explosion in a damaged home.  o   If you see frayed wiring or sparks, or if there is an odor of something burning, you should immediately shut off the electrical system at the main circuit breaker if you have not done so already. o   If you smell gas or suspect a leak, turn off the main gas valve, open all windows and leave the house immediately.  Notify the gas company, the police or fire departments, or State Fire Marshal's office and do not turn on the lights, light matches, smoke or do anything that could cause a spark.  Do not return to your house until you are told it is safe to do so.","status",NA,NA,22,4,6,1,0,0,0,0

In March 2017, 16,600 individuals were apprehended or deemed inadmissible. This is a 35% decrease from February 2017, and a 61% decrease from January 2017, when President Trump took office. The decline represents a 64% decrease from the same month last year.  When President Obama pushed his executive amnesty proposals, he telegraphed to the world that the United States does not take immigration enforcement seriously. As a result, tens of thousands of women and children were put at risk by making the dangerous journey from Central America across our southern border. Our laws matter, and I am glad President Trump has followed the wisdom of the American people by ensuring that our laws are enforced.","status",NA,NA,140,24,17,12,0,2,0,1

I believe they are completely consistent, and I'd like to explain way. The War Powers Act makes it clear that the President cannot engage in a sustained military action without authorization of Congress. I have supported that position in the past, and continue to believe that to this day. My concerns with President Obama's policies were two fold:  1) I did not support arming or propping up rebels in Libya and Syria. I do not believe there is a clear group of ""good guys"" on the ground over there, and by arming the rebels and destabilizing the region, we were making it easier for ISIS to take control and thrive.  2) I wanted to make it clear that the previous AUMF dealing with fighting Islamic Terrorism would not apply in Syria regarding President Obama's desire to help overthrow the Assad regime. Those are distinct issues, and in some ways even mutually exclusive. Any prolonged engagement would require a new authorization from Congress, and while the Assad regime is ruthless, they were not the intended focus of the previous AUMF in regards to combating Islamic Terrorism.  What President Trump ordered last night was a targeted strike of a single facility. The strike showed Syria and the rest of the world that the United States will no longer be a pushover, whether it is in regards to human rights abuses, sovereignty threats against the United States or our allies, or direct threats to the United States. From the facts I currently have, I believe this specific action was in the vital national security interests of the United States. If President Trump continues to order air strikes over the next 60 days, then he will likely be subject to War Powers Act restrictions that would require an authorization from Congress. However, President Trump and his Administration have sent the signal, at least initially, they they do not intend to launch an extended campaign like the one President Obama was proposing. Those of you who know me or have followed my posts, know that I am very cautious about putting our servicemen and women in harms way. Furthermore, I am also concerned about protecting our system of checks & balances as outlined in the Constitution. President's are not Kings, and there is an important role for Congress to play in deciding whether to commit military forces. At the same time, there is a difference between a one off missile strike, and a prolonged engagement. This is always a difficult balancing act for our country, and one that we've been wrestling with since our nation's founding. Hope that puts some things in perspective!","status",NA,NA,175,43,25,10,0,0,3,1

Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes.‚Äù  The Work Resumes 15 When our enemies heard that it was known to us and that God had frustrated their plan, we all returned to the wall, each to his work. 16 From that day on, half of my servants worked on construction, and half held the spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail. And the leaders stood behind the whole house of Judah, 17 who were building on the wall. Those who carried burdens were loaded in such a way that each labored on the work with one hand and held his weapon with the other. 18 And each of the builders had his sword strapped at his side while he built. The man who sounded the trumpet was beside me. 19 And I said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, ‚ÄúThe work is great and widely spread, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another. 20 In the place where you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.‚Äù  21 So we labored at the work, and half of them held the spears from the break of dawn until the stars came out. 22 I also said to the people at that time, ‚ÄúLet every man and his servant pass the night within Jerusalem, that they may be a guard for us by night and may labor by day.‚Äù 23 So neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes; each kept his weapon at his right hand","status",NA,NA,62,46,8,7,0,0,0,2

America has been blessed by rich natural resources resulting in a stable, reliable, and cost effective power grid. Many Americans take this for granted. The economic sustainability of America‚Äôs vast energy ecosystem relies on 24/7 base-load power that is there whenever needed. It is a quality of life issue that Americans have instant access to electricity. It allows for hospitals to power neonatal intensive care units for premature babies, to control the spread of disease by mosquitos during hot summer with air conditioning, and to allow for a single mom to sit up at night teaching her child how to read. What we know for a fact is that the quality of life many across the world tragically don‚Äôt have is directly tied to a society‚Äôs access to electricity.   The energy economy is a diverse sector of fuels that generate this quality of life. As it is in any sector of an economy, price transparency drives this ecosystem. What we saw in the previous administration was a major shift away from basic economics. Instead of providing access to resources in a safe and effective way, President Obama used the bureaucracy as a political weapon to attack the sources of energy that provide base-load power. Renewables are identified as ‚Äúgood‚Äù while fossil fuels and nuclear are seen as ‚Äúbad.‚Äù This is a dangerous game to play with people‚Äôs lives.   Tax credits were used to support renewables like solar and wind, while the bureaucracy was used to squeeze the finances of traditional energy providers. This strategy was presented as a way to ‚Äúdevelop renewable technology‚Äù and to make these sources ‚Äúcost competitive‚Äù until they could compete with fossil fuels. Unfortunately, energy economics does not work in this way. I support solar and wind, I think they could revolutionize electricity, but we have not yet figured out the elephant in the room: storage.   The sun doesn‚Äôt shine all day, and the wind doesn‚Äôt always blow. I go back to the critical need for 24/7 base-load power. Tax credits that artificially support spotty technologies like wind and solar, create two major financing issues: 1. The business structures for solar and wind rely primarily on government subsidies‚Äîcreating a market bubble, and 2. They make the proven technologies unprofitable (and potentially bankrupt). This toxic stew creates a major financial risk to the vast array of companies across this nation that supports our electrical grids. Black and brown outs will spread under this system.   What does this mean for South Carolina? Many of you have followed the discussions about exploring for oil and gas reserves off the coast of the south and mid-Atlantic. I support this exploration. This doesn‚Äôt mean that I think we should start the unrestricted drilling of every square foot off the coast. What I support are the people of South Carolina‚Äôs right to know the resources that may, or may not be, accessible. Seismic survey‚Äôs must be conducted‚Äîby the way, even the Obama Administration admitted to me on several occasions in hearings that there is ZERO scientific data showing substantial harm to marine life. I want South Carolina to be a part of America‚Äôs energy security. Let‚Äôs start with this common sense step to allow for updated seismic surveys.   President Trump‚Äôs executive order to review America‚Äôs access to our natural resources is essential for the future energy security of the United States. It provides clarity for an industry that has been attacked by radical leftists for years. They have no idea how their policies threaten the security of the United States and I am proud that we finally have someone in the White House with clear eyes and steely resolve.

We made a promise to the American people to repeal Obamacare and replace it with policy that brings down costs.   Obamacare is collapsing under its own weight. Insurers are being forced to leave the market all together and middle class families are feeling the squeeze of unaffordable high coverage costs.  Leaving Obamacare in place is not an option for American families.   Due to the hard work of conservatives in the House, this bill now allows states the ability to undo the most costly aspects of Obamacare that are hurting American families.  The MacArthur/ Meadows amendment allows states to opt of two of the most costly insurance regulations: the Essential Health Benefits & community rating. Essential health benefits requirements restrict insurance companies from customizing plans and offering a variety of choices for consumers, keeping costs high.    By allowing states to waive both Federal EHBs (State Insurance Commissions can still govern policy requirements in their states) and community rating, will lead to increased choice and lower costs   Remember- we used the reconciliation process for this bill because it will only need 51 votes in the Senate to pass - instead of the normal 60 vote margin needed to overcome a Democrat filibuster.   Because of that reconciliation process, we were limited by the rules governing reconciliation (items in the bill must be budgetary in nature) which made total repeal impossible and resulted in us having to work diligently to get as much repeal in as possible without making the bill fatal (according to Senate Parliamentarian) in the Senate.  Here are highlights of what the bill does:  REFUNDABLE TAX CREDITS  Refundable tax credits are an important component of the AHCA, designed to give people who don't receive health care at work the same tax benefits as those who do so they can purchase the kind of coverage that is right for their family.  It equalizes the tax treatment of health care regardless of where you buy it and helps create a vibrant individual market. These credits are longstanding conservative policy goals.  REFORMS MEDICAID  One in three physicians are unwilling to accept new Medicaid patients. Unfortunately, Obamacare simply added more people to a broken system. The AHCA is a historic shift of power back to the states so that we can make it work for those who need it. It reforms Medicaid so that it is flexible and responsive to those it was created to serve.  It prohibits states from expanding into the current broken Medicaid system.  It maximizes state flexibility. It gives states the choice between a per capita allotment or a traditional block grant and provides the option for states to implement work requirements for Medicaid recipients.  It ensures the rug isn‚Äôt pulled from underneath any able-bodied patient as he or she transitions to other coverage, like a plan purchased with refundable tax credits.  EXPANDS HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS  Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are tax-free health care savings accounts for Americans with high-deductible health plans. HSAs are critical for helping Americans save and spend their health care dollars more wisely.  The AHCA would nearly double the amount Americans can contribute to their accounts, which will give greater choice and flexibility in purchasing coverage. Conservatives agree: HSAs must be a focal point of health care reform.  PROTECTS PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS  First and foremost, the bill contains numerous protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The law is clear: Under no circumstance can people be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. The latest draft contains two more layers of security for these individuals:  The MacArthur amendment gives flexibility to states to tackle premium prices. However, there is a very strict process for obtaining that waiver. It will only be given to states with high-risk pools and other protections in place.  For states seeking a waiver, the Upton amendment provides an additional $8 billion to allow people with pre-existing conditions who haven‚Äôt maintained continuous coverage to acquire affordable care.  RESTORES PRO-LIFE PRINCIPLES  The AHCA defunds Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion provider in the country, for one year by blocking more than $500 million of federal dollars. It redirects the money to community health centers, which far outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics.

The amount of outright false information that has been pushed out about this bill is incredible. I plan to make posts on the ObamaCare repeal aspects of the bill and clear up misconceptions about the MacArthur amendment in later posts, but for now I want to address some of the misinformation that the legislation exempts members of Congress from the bill.  Bottom line, Members of Congress are NOT exempt from the ACHA. The House passed a stand alone bill yesterday around the same time as the ACHA that eliminated any exemptions for Congress. That bill passed unanimously.  Here's the background: Democrats have been unwilling to acknowledge the message that the American people have repeatedly sent since 2010 that they want to see ObamaCare repealed. As a result, Democrats have been unwilling to cooperate with the repeal of ObamaCare, forcing Congress to use a process called reconciliation to get around Democratic filibusters. Reconciliation is a process that has many rules and restrictions. First reconciliation instructions must be included in a budget that passes out of the House and the Senate. Those instructions must include the topics that will be addressed during reconciliation, and the respective committees of jurisdiction on those topics.  ObamaCare deals with taxes, government spending, and healthcare so the committees of jurisdiction that were listed on the reconciliation instructions were the Energy & Commerce Committee (healthcare), Ways & Means (taxes), and Budget (spending).  During the debate, conservatives started pushing for changes to essential health benefits. This is the provision of ObamaCare that President Obama got in trouble for lying about by saying ""if you like your healthcare plan you can keep it."" It's the provision in the law that specifies what type of healthcare plans are allowed to be sold. It's also the provision that requires a 21 year old single male and a 60 year old woman to have maternity coverage on their insurance plan.  After a lot of negotiating, the White House and House leadership agreed to an amendment that addressed essential health benefits. There was only one problem. In the original ObamaCare bill, Republicans forced a change to the healthcare bill that required that Members of Congress and their staffs receive their insurance through the ObamaCare exchange. However, any bill that impacts Congress has to go through the Committee on House Administration, which was not listed in the reconciliation instructions. Therefore, the amendment addressing essential health benefits had to purposefully exclude members of Congress from the bill in order for it to advance. However, there was universal recognition that exempting Congress from the provisions was a bad idea, so immediately a stand alone bill that was introduced that would remove any exemptions for Congress. That bill was brought up at the same time as the AHCA and passed unanimously.  Had conservatives been consulted more in the initial drafting of the bill and with the reconciliation instructions, we could have avoided this situation. Hopefully this will be a lesson on the importance of soliciting feedback from conservatives early and often.","status",NA,NA,277,119,175,13,0,1,2,14

Another topic I'd like to address related to the bill is the issue of pre-existing conditions. Happy to explain in more technical detail, but first I thought I'd share the following op-ed from one of my colleagues who voted for the bill who has a child with Down Syndrome.  By Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers  Hearing late-night host Jimmy Kimmel‚Äôs emotional monologue this week about his son‚Äôs condition and his family‚Äôs experience in the moments after his birth, I had a flashback to the day my son was born and we learned he had Down syndrome.

When you‚Äôre facing years of doctor‚Äôs appointments, you want to know that having a preexisting condition, such as an extra 21st chromosome or a heart defect, won‚Äôt prevent you or your loved ones from accessing the care you need.  Protections for children such as Cole Rodgers and Billy Kimmel have long existed, as they should. And despite what people are saying, House Republicans aren‚Äôt seeking to strip these protections ‚Äî or anyone‚Äôs protections ‚Äî away.  It‚Äôs the people we love ‚Äî our children, friends and neighbors ‚Äî who are the inspiration behind our American Health Care Act, which we passed in the House on Thursday.

We‚Äôve had conversations ‚Äî tough conversations ‚Äî with people from all walks of life, and we‚Äôve passed a bill that we‚Äôre confident will improve lives.  When Obamacare was introduced, Republicans and Democrats knew the status quo wasn‚Äôt working. But Republicans rejected the notion that to help 2 million people with preexisting conditions get access to care, we needed a 2,000-page bill that transformed one-sixth of the economy.  The vote and passage of the bill marks an achievement for President Trump, who has pledged to repeal and replace Obamacare but has struggled to secure legislative wins early in his presidency.  At each point of our process to repeal Obamacare, we have not lost sight of our responsibility to the most vulnerable in our communities. Safety nets and protections are important and must be maintained for those who need them most. Our plan accomplishes this mission in two key ways: by guaranteeing that access to health coverage can‚Äôt be denied for people with preexisting conditions, and by empowering states to innovate with new models for better patient outcomes at a lower cost.  This bill isn‚Äôt perfect. It doesn‚Äôt include every single component I wanted. But it came down to the AHCA or the continued disaster of Obamacare, which was an easy choice. The AHCA is a major improvement, because a federal one-size-fits-all approach to health care isn‚Äôt the answer. A major feature of our plan is returning control to states, through both funding and reducing red tape, which empowers them to innovate and to stabilize costs.  With Obamacare, our health- insurance system relies on younger, healthier people subsidizing the costs of the older and sicker. As a result, insurance costs consistently increase to cover the costs of people who are considered ‚Äúhigh-risk,‚Äù namely those who are sick or who have preexisting conditions. High-risk pools and reinsurance programs at the state level address this concern and have been successful in the past. Our plan establishes a program to provide federal resources for states to create high-risk pools, reduce out-of-pocket costs or promote better access to services.  States know better than the federal government how to allocate and manage resources to address the needs of their people. Our plan allows states to serve and provide financial support directly to vulnerable populations, including people with preexisting conditions. We‚Äôve seen this system work before ‚Äî just look at Maine. After the state created an ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù high-risk pool (‚Äúinvisible‚Äù because it did not cordon off people with preexisting conditions from the traditional market) and relaxed its premium rating rules in 2011, people with preexisting conditions continued to have access to health care and their premiums were cut in half. Young and healthy people could finally afford to enter the market, and prices stabilized even further. This approach was more personal, reasonable and innovative than anything a bureaucrat in D.C. could have imagined.  To me, protecting people with preexisting conditions isn‚Äôt just good policy ‚Äî it‚Äôs a personal mission.  All across the country, families like mine have real concerns about the future of health care, and they are why we‚Äôre focusing on results and working on these reforms. Obamacare is wrong for America. It has failed, and it‚Äôs only getting worse ‚Äî making health care more expensive and less accessible. To stand by and do nothing would be irresponsible. The AHCA is a monumental step forward that trusts the American people ‚Äî not the federal government ‚Äî to make the best decisions for themselves and their families.  Our effort to create a better health-care future for all Americans isn‚Äôt finished. Whether it‚Äôs allowing insurance to be purchased across state lines or implementing other insurance reforms, we will continue our work until every American has access to good-quality, affordable health care and our most vulnerable communities have peace of mind.","status",NA,NA,135,75,68,2,0,0,0,5

"RepJeffDuncan","187268144624279_1679159828768429","Congressman Jeff Duncan","2017-05-08","2017-05-08 20:31:53","I was asked to give a big picture assessment on why the House passed health care bill is better than ObamaCare. To start, we need to be reminded of the underlying premises of ObamaCare that moved health care in the wrong direction. Ideologically, ObamaCare was based on the premise that Washington, DC can better handle health care policy than individuals, states, and the free-market. When President Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid helped usher this bill through Congress, their fundamental goal was to use their Democrat super majority to pass the most liberal legislation possible. That is why despite having a number of moderate Republican Members of Congress, not one of them voted for the law. ObamaCare has resulted in insurers leaving markets, premiums increasing, and consumers left with fewer choices.  The law increased government‚Äôs involvement in our daily lives, attempted to redistribute wealth, and use social engineering to bridge the divide between patient based health care and a single payer, socialist healthcare system. ObamaCare was never written to be a permanent solution to health care in this country. It was written to pave the way for a socialized and rationed single-payer health care system.  As a conservative, I believe in limited government, free-market competition, local control, and empowering individuals over government. I am diametrically opposed to the premises and the realities of ObamaCare. Therefore, my goal has been and continues to be to repeal ObamaCare as much as possible. Over the years, I have put forward my solutions on how to make health care better. Most of the time when I say ‚ÄúRepeal and Replace,‚Äù I have had to defend the ‚Äúreplace‚Äù part, because understandably people are very concerned about any more government control of healthcare. But when I say replace, I mean replace with free-market solutions like association health care plans, giving individuals the same tax benefits to go buy insurance on their own as they would if they received it through their employer, and increasing competition by allowing the sale of insurance across state lines.  If you could make me King for a day, my plan would be to pass the fullest repeal of ObamaCare possible using budget reconciliation. Once the law was completely off the books, I would work with both parties to implement the free-market ‚Äúreplace‚Äù package that I outlined above. With ObamaCare already being repealed, Democrats would have the choice between working with Republicans to make health care better, or doing nothing.  Unfortunately, Democrats are circling the wagon to protect the legacy of President Obama. They don‚Äôt want to surrender the progress they have made towards moving America closer to a socialized health care system. Therefore, they are uninterested in working with us to repeal ObamaCare. That means Republicans will have to go it alone to repeal ObamaCare. Because of the 60 vote threshold requirement in the Senate to break a filibuster, the best chance of repeal is through what is called budget reconciliation. If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about the reconciliation process, please review my previous posts on the subject. But in summary, reconciliation allows for only a simple majority vote in the Senate, but it does place restrictions on what can be included in the bill.  President Trump has made the decision to repeal and replace at the same time, which limits our options even further. Without challenges to the parliamentarian or Senate rules, most of the reforms that I previously outlined cannot be included in a reconciliation bill.  Therefore, the goal becomes how much can you repeal of ObamaCare while conforming to the reconciliation rules and offering replacement reforms at the same time. The American Health Care Act (AHCA) starts off strong by repealing the ObamaCare tax increases. The AHCA eliminates the individual mandate tax which impacts 8 million Americans each year. It eliminates ObamaCare taxes that impacts Americans with Health Savings and Flexible Spending Accounts. The AHCA eliminates the ObamaCare Chronic Care tax which caped Americans ability to deduct high medical expenses on their taxes, as well as eliminating the ObamaCare HSA withdrawal tax. The AHCA also restores the 40 hour work week by repealing regulations that made it difficult for businesses to hire workers and forced individuals into taking multiple part-time jobs.  Another important roll back of ObamaCare in the AHCA is the state waivers for essential health benefits. This is the provision of ObamaCare that President Obama got in trouble for lying about by saying ""if you like your healthcare plan you can keep it."" It's the provision in the law that specifies what type of health care plans are allowed to be sold. It's also the provision that requires a 21 year old single male and a 60 year old woman to have maternity coverage on their insurance plan. Under provisions in the bill, states have the option to apply for waivers from certain federal insurance regulations that increase insurance premiums. This new flexibility will allow states to design insurance frameworks that are right for their unique populations, providing superior care and lowering costs for patients.  In regards to the ‚Äúreplace‚Äù provisions in the AHCA, they don‚Äôt address many of the areas I would like, but they are a positive step in the right direction in getting the government out of the way. The bill reallocates some funds from winding down Medicaid expansion and other ObamaCare programs to help states with establishing high risk pools. The bill creates an invisible high risk pool program which has been successful in several states, which helps control costs of high-risk patients by not fully separating them from the rest of the healthy population in insurance pools.   We all know that one of the largest groups of individuals who want insurance but can‚Äôt afford it are those who are either self-employed or work for a small business. One conservative solution to help address this problem is to give people who want to buy insurance in the open market the same tax benefits that you would receive if you received your insurance through your employer. The bill attempts to follow that general philosophy by giving the public an advanceable tax credit mirroring the employer provided benefit, tied to income and family size, for the sole purpose of purchasing insurance.  Again, if I were King for the day, I would like to address a whole host of other cost drivers in healthcare using even bolder free-market reforms. I remain hopeful that those reforms will have their consideration in Congress, but in the meantime, these are good steps to repeal large portions of ObamaCare, make incremental but significant changes that moves power back to the states and to the people, and gives the Senate the opportunity to make the bill better.","status",NA,NA,133,80,51,6,2,0,1,12

What harm would it do to use 21st Century technology to assess the potential resources off of America's shores?  Should natural gas resources be discovered off SC's coast, over the horizon, I'll bet the conversations would be different with regards to how South Carolina might play a part in the nation's energy security matrix.  If a predictable amount of oil is discovered off our coastline, I am willing to have a broader conversation about whether or not the state pursues the development of these resources or not.  The Department of the Interior‚Äôs decision to reverse the Obama Administration‚Äôs blanket denial of six Atlantic seismic survey permit applications is a win for the people of South Carolina. By allowing for the new Administration to take a measured and thoughtful approach, I hope they will understand the clear science on the issue and proceed to approve these permits. It was unclear why the Obama Administration blocked the ability for South Carolinians to research any potential energy resources under the Atlantic outer-continental shelf. The radical environmental critics against any exploration and development of natural energy resources have long claimed that seismic surveys would kill marine mammals. However, there is broad scientific consensus that this is simply not the case. Even former Director Abigail Hopper, who headed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management under the Obama Administration, acknowledged to me under oath in a hearing that there is zero scientific evidence that seismic surveys would irrevocably harm marine mammals. The blanket denial by the Obama Administration flies in the face of this testimony.  American energy security should be the overriding goal of federal policy. Environmental precautions should be observed, as clear processes are stated and provided for in law. However, the ultimate concern for all Americans is the ‚Äúexpeditious and orderly development‚Äù of such offshore resources. It is a matter not just of national interest, but the strategic security of America. I applaud the Trump Administration for making this determination, and hope a future approval of seismic survey permits will take place to give South Carolinians the facts of offshore resource potential.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJeffDuncan/photos/a.188882864462807.45546.187268144624279/1683467245004354/?type=3",NA,59,48,3,2,0,1,5,2

Regulations that significantly overreach on federal authority, hurt jobs, and run afoul of the Constitution. Here's an overview of what we've done:  Improve American Energy  The Stream Buffer Rule (H.J. Res. 38) would have saddled mines with unnecessary regulations, putting up to 64% of America‚Äôs coal reserves off limits and threatening between 40,000 to 70,000 mining jobs.  The SEC Disclosure Rule for Resource Extraction (H.J. Res. 41) would have put an unreasonable compliance burden on publicly traded American energy companies, putting them at a disadvantage to foreign-owned businesses.  Increase Local Control  The Bureau of Land Management Planning 2.0 Rule (H.J. Res. 44) would have reduced local authority over large swaths of land out west, massively expanding the federal government‚Äôs control over more than 175 million acres of land‚Äîabout 4,000 times the size of Washington, D.C.‚Äîin 11 western states.  The Teacher Preparation Rule (H.J. Res. 58) would have forced states to use Washington‚Äôs standards to determine whether a teacher preparation program is effective, undermining local control over education and potentially exacerbating the shortage of special education teachers.  The Education Accountability Rule (H.J. Res. 57) would have been an unfunded mandate imposing Washington‚Äôs standard for how to assess schools on state and local governments.  The Unemployment Insurance Drug Testing Rule (H.J. Res. 42) would have severely restricted states‚Äô ability to limit drug abusers from receiving unemployment benefits even if the drug users are not able and available for work, as the law requires.  The National Wildlife Hunting and Fishing Rule (H.J. Res. 69) would have infringed on Alaska‚Äôs right to sustainably manage fish and wildlife by overregulating hunting‚Äîa move that could set the stage for the federal government to undermine local control across the entire U.S.  Defend Our Rights & Equally Apply the Law  The Social Security Administration‚Äôs Second Amendment Restrictions (H.J. Res. 40) would have increased scrutiny on up to 4.2 million law-abiding disabled Americans attempting to purchase firearms, potentially depriving people of their constitutional rights without proper due process protections.  The Federal Contracts Blacklisting Rule (H.J. Res. 37) would have unjustly blocked many businesses accused of violating labor laws from federal contracts before they‚Äôve even had a chance to defend themselves in court.  The OSHA Power Grab Rule (H.J. Res. 83) would have been clearly unlawful. The law explicitly that employers can only be targeted for failing to keep proper health and safety records within a six-month time period. The rule we overturned would have extended that to a full five years.  FCC Internet Service Provider Rule (S.J. Res. 34) would have treated internet service providers (ISPs) unequally compared to other companies like Google and Facebook by applying different privacy rules to different companies.  Protect Workers  The State Retirement Plan Rule (H.J. Res. 66) would have treated employees unequally by allowing states to force some workers into second-tier government-run retirement accounts that lack the same protections as private-sector accounts.  The Local Retirement Plan Rule (H.J. Res. 67) would have treated employees unequally by allowing certain localities to force some workers into second-tier government-run retirement accounts that lack the same protections as private-sector accounts.  Save Lives  The Title X Abortion Funding Rule (H.J. Res. 43) would have forced states to administer Title X health funding to abortion providers, even if states want to redirect those funds to community health centers and hospitals that offer more comprehensive coverage.","status",NA,NA,133,52,48,14,1,2,1,11

Ivanka Trump isn't on the Board of Directors nor does she have any direct ties to the World Bank.  The World Bank has been around since 1944. Its mission is: ""is the reduction of poverty"" and all decisions ""must be guided by a commitment to the promotion of foreign investment and international trade and to the facilitation of capital investment."" (Wiki)  Furthermore, World Bank focuses: 1. Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger 2. Achieve Universal Primary Education 3. Promote Gender Equality 4. Reduce Child Mortality 5. Improve Maternal Health 6. Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases 7. Ensure Environmental Sustainability 8. Develop a Global Partnership for Development  All things that the left generally support unconditionally.  Now - to be clear - I generally don't like globalist institutions, especially when US Tax dollars fund them.  I do, however, believe there is a HUGE difference between the World Bank (1944) and The Clinton Foundation.  But progressive media would have you believe that this is Ivanka Trump's organization, that she directs expenditures and personally benefits from its decisions.  Look: Salon ""Ivanka Trump wants foreign leaders to give money to her foundation""  New York Daily News ""Ivanka Trump‚Äôs women entrepreneurs fund takes $100 million from Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates""  CNN ""Saudis, UAE pledge $100 million to Ivanka Trump proposed fund""  To just read some headlines, you would think that this donation lined the pockets of Ivanka Trump or that somehow she personally created this World Bank and controls it. You would believe that the World Bank is ""her foundation!"" If you read the articles themselves, they are clear to avoid that accusation (unlike some on Face Book).  NPR: Norm Eisen, former ethics official for the Obama Administration and a regular critic of the Trump family's conflicts of interest, noted in an email to NPR, ""In my view foreign government donations to a fund run by a reputable international organization like the World Bank for a good cause are generally acceptable.""  To compare a third-party, long-standing organization like the World Bank and The Clinton Foundation (which employed a President's daughter, btw) in such a way as to paint Ivanka Trump in a bad light is wrong.

There are multiple things wrong with that statement. President Obama repeatedly attempted to make deals with foreign powers without Congressional approval. We do not have a parliamentary form of government, and therefore the President does not necessarily speak on behalf of the country as a whole. Recognizing this, President Obama had no business committing the United States to adhere to an international agreement without the approval of the Senate. However, he knew the Senate would likely reject such a treaty, so he tried to broker an agreement anyway betting that he could pressure any future Administration to adhere to it.

For the past several years, I have called for us to put political correctness aside and do what is right for the country to keep our citizens safe. President Trump has suggested many of these same proposals, including carefully monitoring who we allow into our country and restricting the entry of people coming from terrorist safe havens. I have also introduced a bill entitled the Terrorist Deportation Act which would deport any non-citizen whose name appears on a terror watch list. Our borders and broken immigration system are the soft underbelly of our country. We must take the necessary and appropriate precautions to prevent the war against radical Islam from spreading to our shores. President Trump's reforms are currently tied up in court, despite the law being very clear that he has the authority to take action. I will continue to work with the President and the rest of Congress to ensure we take action quickly to address the threat of radical Islamist terrorism.

By Kimberley A. Strassel  Here is what Americans this week were told counted as ‚Äúnews‚Äù: Jared Kushner‚Äôs past meetings. Russians. James Comey‚Äôs upcoming testimony. Russians. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs latest conspiracy theories. Russians. Bob Mueller‚Äôs as-yet-nonexistent investigation (into Russians). Kathy Griffin, Mr. Met and, of course, ‚Äúcovfefe.‚Äù Total words printed on these subjects? At least a duodecillion.  Here‚Äôs what actually happened this week, the ‚Äúnews‚Äù that holds real consequences for real Americans:  ‚Ä¢ Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke signed an order to begin reopening Alaska‚Äôs National Petroleum Reserve to oil and gas exploration, reversing the Obama administration‚Äôs ideologically driven 2013 shutdown. The order even aims at opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to production‚Äîa move that is decades overdue. This could not only buck up the listless Alaskan economy but cement the U.S. as an oil and gas powerhouse.  ‚Ä¢ In related news, the Dakota Access Pipeline finally went live.  ‚Ä¢ The Fish and Wildlife Service took steps that may stop the Obama administration‚Äôs last-minute endangered-species listing for the Texas Hornshell, a freshwater mussel. That listing, based on outdated science, threatens significant harm to the Texas economy and was done over the protest of state officials and local industry.  ‚Ä¢ Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross surprisingly said that he was open to completing the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP, a far-reaching trade agreement being negotiated with the European Union.  ‚Ä¢ Sen. John Thune, the upper chamber‚Äôs third-ranking Republican, said his caucus had moved beyond meetings and on to ‚Äúdrafting‚Äù the base language of an ObamaCare replacement. The No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn, vowed the Senate would ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù have a bill by ‚Äúthe end of July at the latest.‚Äù  And on and on. The Environmental Protection Agency stayed crushing regulations. The U.S. tested the first ground-based system for intercepting ballistic missiles. New numbers showed the private economy adding a rip-roaring 253,000 jobs in May.  Who is to blame for this real-news blackout? The press, obviously. But the co-culprit: Donald Trump.  Americans know that much of the mainstream media is biased in how it presents stories. The dirty little secret is that journalists‚Äô far greater power rests in what they choose to‚Äîor not to‚Äîreport. The country is no better informed about exactly how Russia interfered in the election than it was in October, when intelligence agencies issued a statement expressing their belief that Moscow had helped hack emails. Not a single useful fact has since been added, nor a single investigation completed, nor a single official report produced. Until those inquiries are completed, we will have no new real facts. Yet every day, a new Russia story.  Few expect better from today‚Äôs ratings-obsessed media. Especially given its new mission of working with Democrats and Never Trumpers to take down a presidency. That means spewing strategic leaks and suppositions, which create new controversies, which are spun into yet more distant scandals. We are these days reading exposes about former national security adviser Mike Flynn‚Äôs work for a Turkish businessman, which is utterly removed from the original question of Russian ‚Äúcollusion.‚Äù  The result is a surreal situation in which the near-hysterical press coverage of Trump the man (and potential Russian operative) is utterly divorced from the substantive actions his administration takes or the progress it makes. Mr. Trump‚Äôs cabinet, which includes some of the best reformers in the conservative world, is methodically implementing a far-reaching deregulatory agenda. Congress is moving ahead on key promises.  Thus Mr. Trump‚Äôs culpability. The president knows better than most the ills of the media; he rails about them constantly. Yet he continues to be the indulger in chief. He daily provides new, explosive tweets that give reporters every excuse to keep up their obsessions about Russia, Mr. Comey, Hillary, Carter Page.  Mr. Trump‚Äôs Twitter handle may be the most powerful communications tool on the planet. He has the awesome ability, unlike any president in history, to force the press to focus on his agenda by putting it out into the world every morning (or late night, as it may be). He could use that tool to set the daily discussion. Instead, he‚Äôs using it to undermine his own administration.  Mr. Trump also has at his disposal an array of famous surrogates who could spread his message. He has all the free media he could ever hope for, if only he used it in a strategic fashion. He has activist groups to help push for his reforms, but they can‚Äôt compete amid the crazy headlines.  Team Trump owes it to voters to get the real news out about its agenda and successes. But that will require doing more than complaining about the press. This White House needs to set and define the daily debate. It‚Äôs that, or Russia headlines through 2018.","status",NA,NA,90,50,28,8,2,1,0,5

I've started writing several updates, but the narrative changes before I even have the chance to click ""post."" Here is where we stand right now. The Senate is having a difficult time finding the goldilocks zone for a healthcare bill. The draft bills that have been filed have either been too conservative or too liberal to get 50 Senators on board. The most recent plan by Mitch McConnell was to vote on a clean repeal bill, and focus on replace reforms later. This makes a lot of sense because Congress has already passed a bill like this before, but it was vetoed by President Obama. However, Senators Shelley Moore Capito, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins came out against this plan. For the record, Susan Collins voted against the 2015 reconciliation bill so her stance is at least consistent. However, Senators Murkowski and Capito voted yes on this exact same bill in 2015. With the Senate only having a 2 vote Republican majority, and with no Democrats being willing to vote against Obamacare, three no votes is enough to block a clean repeal vote.  I'm angry, frustrated, and disappointed. I made compromises on the House bill to advance the measure and make progress towards achieving our goal. Yet the Senate seems unable or unwilling to do its job. I haven't given up yet. Do not underestimate the impact of the people to get this over the finish line. The House did its job, and now its time for the Senate to do theirs. The people have spent years making their voices heard on this issue. They elected a Republican House, they elected a Republican Senate, they elected a Republican President. Washington has run out of excuses. Yes, the path to passing a bill is very narrow, but it is achievable. The people have done so much work to get us to this point, but I need you to keep pushing to help get this over the finish line. This is not the time to say, ""well I already did my part,"" (even though that is true). Now is the time to roll up your sleeves and to get to work and remind your representatives why you sent them there in the first place.","status",NA,NA,255,185,59,16,6,1,3,35

This tragic case sheds light on the darker side of socialized medicine. When the government runs healthcare, controls healthcare, and taxes you for healthcare, we shouldn't be surprised when they (the government) are the ones who get to decide who receives treatment and who does not. The Gard family had privately raised money to pay for an experimental treatment for their son, but the government stepped in and decided that they knew better than Charlie's own parents. This all may be acceptable in Europe, but it's not the American way, and I pray to God it never becomes our world view over here.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/07/24/charlie-gards-parents-end-fight-over-treatment-for-their-terminally-ill-son/?utm_term=.03232861b90a&wpisrc=al_alert-COMBO-world%252Bnation&wpmk=1","washingtonpost.com",238,141,161,5,0,4,228,53

As I indicated in one of my last posts, with only a two vote majority in the Senate, Republicans have had difficulty finding the ""Goldilocks zone"" for a bill. The latest effort has been a clean repeal of Obamacare, with a vote on replacement at a later date. This is similar to the bill that passed Congress in 2015 but was vetoed by President Obama. Unfortunately, 3-4 Senators have come out against this approach, although it is the same bill that all but one of them had voted for last Congress. Frustrating does not begin to describe the feelings up here, but I am hopeful that some kind of breakthrough can be made and the Senate can begin debating this critical piece of the American People's agenda.  On the House side we have a busy week. We'll be voting on new Russia sanctions today and a spending package (titled The Make America Secure Appropriations Act) that includes several appropriations bills covering Energy & Water, Military Construction & Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, Legislative Branch funding, and the border wall funding as part of the Department of Homeland Security. There have been over 300 amendments filed to the spending package, so I am expecting votes all day, every day this week until around 1AM.  I am also hopeful that a bill to fund the Veterans Choice program that failed under suspension last night but received majority support will be brought back up again this week.  I would also like to reiterate my belief that Congress has plenty of work to do, and should cancel the August recess.","status",NA,NA,121,68,19,6,0,1,1,16

Skinny in that it only repealed a few of the taxes, the individual mandate, the employer mandate for eight years, and defunded Planned Parenthood for a year. It wasn't much, but it was at least something and showed some progress. Unfortunately, Senators Collins, McCain, and Murkowski voted against even that modest measure. It is infuriating that 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats couldn't put their egos aside to get this done for the American people. It's disrespectful to the American people for a handful of these Members (and there are only a handful) to go back on their word to repeal Obamacare when given the opportunity. 90% or more of the Republicans in Congress have been willing to compromise and do the right thing to get this across the finish line, but because of the actions of a few, this critical issue for the country has fallen short, at least for now.  I am hopeful that the Senate may decide to return to regular order, and send the bill back to committee to see if a consensus can be reached. But the Senate is a fickle bunch, and I don't have a clear read on whether or not that is going to happen.  When I said I wanted to repeal Obamacare, I meant it. I voted to repeal it, I voted to defund it, I voted to repeal parts of it, and I supported court cases against it. If there was anything in my power to stop this horrible law which puts the government between you and your doctor, I have supported it for the past 7 years. I have also laid out for years what I thought a free-market replacement plan should look like, not in bullet points or some vague governing principles, but in actual legislation. I am disappointed that whether through electoral cowardice or a lack of conviction that a handful of my colleagues didn't have the same sense of urgency and commitment to the American people to get this done.  The worst thing that will come out of this is that Americans are going to be hurt by this inaction. Obamacare is collapsing. There are parts of this country where Americans don't have access to an insurer because companies have left the Obamacare exchanges. There are people in this country who are forbidden by the government from buying the type of insurance which is best for them, so they are forced to go without. Insurance rates are going to continue to go up, and choices in care are already on the decline.  I was always taught the importance of keeping your word. I can say with a straight face that I have followed through on my commitments to repeal this horrible healthcare law. Unfortunately, there's a group of people in Washington that seem more worried about being re-elected or being well-liked than adhering to that basic human principle of honoring your promises. If you're reading this and you're from South Carolina, your delegation largely did the right thing and followed through on the promises that were made to you. If you're from another state, you may want to do some research to see whether your federal representative's words matched their actions.  I promise to continuing fighting, and I promise to continue calling it as I see it.  Blessings & Liberty,  -Jeff","status",NA,NA,413,241,96,12,14,4,12,84

By Mary Anastasia O‚ÄôGrady July 30, 2017 4:29 p.m. ET   Forget all you‚Äôve heard about dialogue in Venezuela between the regime and the opposition. Hungry, hurting Venezuelans are done talking. The country is in the early stages of civil war. Sunday‚Äôs Cuban-managed electoral power play was the latest provocation.   In my column two weeks ago, ‚ÄúHow Cuba Runs Venezuela,‚Äù I failed to mention Havana‚Äôs 2005 takeover of the Venezuelan office that issues national identity cards and passports. It was a Castro-intelligence coup, carried out with then-President Hugo Ch√°vez‚Äôs permission. The move handed Havana the national Rolodex necessary to spy on Venezuelans and surreptitiously colonize the country. Islamic extremists received Venezuelan passports to give them false cover when crossing borders. Regime supporters got the papers they need to vote under more than one identity.   This is something to keep in mind when Venezuelan strongman Nicol√°s Maduro reports the results of Sunday‚Äôs election for representatives to draft a new constitution. In polls, some 80% of Venezuelans oppose Mr. Maduro‚Äôs ‚Äúconstituent assembly.‚Äù But the opposition boycotted Sunday‚Äôs election because they know Cuba is running things, that voter rolls are corrupted, and that there is no transparency in the operation of electronic voting machines.   Opposition leaders in Caracas are still trying to use peaceful means to unseat Mr. Maduro. Last week they orchestrated an effective 48-hour national strike and on Friday another day of demonstrations.   But grass-roots faith and hope in a peaceful solution has been lost. One symptom of this desperation is the mass exodus under way. On Tuesday the Panam Post reported that ‚Äúmore than 26,000 people crossed the border into Colombia Monday, July 26, according to the National Director of Migration in [the Colombian city of] C√∫cuta.‚Äù   Venezuelan applications for asylum in the U.S. were up 160% last year, making Venezuelans No. 1 among asylum seekers to the U.S. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, there were 27,000 Venezuelan asylum seekers world-wide in 2016. By mid-July this year there were already 50,000.   Last week the National Guard arrested and badly beat violinist Wuilly Arteaga, who has become a national symbol of peace. Many of those fleeing say they fear that after Sunday the regime crackdown will intensify. Some of those staying behind have already begun to launch counteroffensives. This provides the regime an excuse for increasing repression, yet there is a growing sense that violence is the only remaining option.   The regime has the armored vehicles, the high-powered rifles, and the SWAT gear. But the population has the numbers and the anger. It also may increasingly have support from dissident government forces.   Consider what happened in the municipality of Mario Brice√±o Iragorry in the state of Aragua earlier this month, when the pro-government mayor and the regime‚Äôs paramilitary, known as colectivos, began looting shops that were closed during a one-day national strike.   Eyewitness testimonies sent to me by a source in Caracas describe how townspeople tried to defend the shops. The mayor brought in paramilitary reinforcements. But the town was saved when the judicial police arrived from the state capital of Maracay. According to the Venezuelan daily El Nacional, they arrested the mayor, who was armed, and ‚Äúmany‚Äù colectivos.   The judicial police, who number around 12,000 and conduct criminal investigations, are Venezuela‚Äôs largest national police agency. They are also responsible for protecting Attorney General Luisa Ortega D√≠az. Ms. Ortega broke with the regime in March when the Maduro-controlled Supreme Court tried to dissolve the opposition-controlled legislature. She is an outspoken critic of Mr. Maduro‚Äôs constituent assembly. She has not been arrested, probably because the regime doesn‚Äôt want to confront the judicial police.   There are also dissident members of the military but their possible role in recovering democracy seems difficult. The leadership is pro-regime and though there are rumors of grumbling among the lower ranks, organizing a coup requires communication. The security and intelligence apparatus installed by Cuba makes that challenging.   But a citizens‚Äô revolt, led by young people whose families are starving, is already under way. Last week after 24-year-old Ender Caldera died from injuries sustained in a demonstration in Timotes, Merida, his friends exacted revenge by intercepting an armored National Guard truck on a mountain road and setting it afire. Numerous other National Guard vehicles have been torched in Caracas.   The state of Barinas, where the late Hugo Ch√°vez was born, was once a regime stronghold. Today it is an antigovernment pressure-cooker where dissidents burn debris in the streets and confront the National Guard. It is the state with the highest number of protest fatalities in the country since the street protests began in April.   Mr. Maduro tried Sunday to put a ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù imprimatur on his power grab. But by the afternoon there were at least six dead in clashes with the regime. On the streets of Venezuela, it is now fight or flight.","link","https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuela-heads-for-civil-war-1501446573","wsj.com",58,48,72,0,0,22,39,5

Here's an overview of the bill, I would love to hear your thoughts.   A SURGE IN UNSKILLED IMMIGRATION: For decades, low-skilled and unskilled immigration into the United States has surged, depressing wages and harming America‚Äôs most vulnerable citizens.  Our system does not prioritize the most highly skilled immigrants‚Äîjust 1 out of every 15 immigrants to the United States comes here because of their skills.  On average, 1 million immigrants are accepted into the United States for legal permanent residency annually, and most of them are low or unskilled workers.  This influx is the equivalent of adding more than the population of San Francisco to the country every year.  More than 50 percent of all immigrant households receive welfare benefits, compared to only 30 percent of native households in the United States that receive welfare benefits.  Immigrants with a college education or higher are, on average, less likely to be welfare recipients than those without the same degree of education.  Since 1979, Americans with a high school diploma or less have seen their real hourly wages decline.  American workers without a high school diploma have seen their real hourly wages fall by 17 percent.  THE RAISE ACT PUTS AMERICAN WORKERS FIRST: President Donald J. Trump supports the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act to prioritize immigrants based on the skills they bring to our Nation while safeguarding the jobs of American workers.  The RAISE Act replaces the current permanent employment-visa framework with a skills-based system that rewards applicants based on their individual merits.  The system rewards education, English-language ability, high-paying job offers, past achievements, and entrepreneurial initiative.  This system is similar to the merit-based immigration systems used by Canada and Australia.  The RAISE Act reduces overall immigration numbers to limit low-skilled and unskilled labor entering the United States.  The RAISE Act prioritizes immediate family members of United States residents, including spouses and minor children, but ends preferences for extended family members and adult children.  United States citizens needing to take care of elderly parents can receive renewable, temporary visas for them.  The RAISE Act eliminates the outdated Diversity Visa lottery system, which serves questionable economic and humanitarian interests.  The RAISE Act limits permanent resident status for refugees to 50,000 a year, in line with the 13-year average.","status",NA,NA,175,131,27,21,2,0,3,12

This is ridiculous and as a result of this pressure many businesses have stayed away from these advisory councils or have slowly dropped off over the past few months. The political pressure to stop industry leaders from simply advising the President of the United States sets a terrible precedent, drives us to a new level of hyper-partisanship, and will only hurt the country. If the political left refuses to allow business leaders to advise a Republican President, I predict that the political right will likely demand the same level of non-engagement with a Democrat President out of fairness. The end result will be that the government will suffer from a lack of experience and valuable insight while making policy decisions.

When it comes to border security and immigration enforcement, President Trump has proven to be extremely effective and has shown just how much can be accomplished when we have a President who empowers those under him to enforce the laws already on the books, and follows through on those commitments (amazing, right?!?) Here are some facts to consider:  President Trump is touring facilities today in the Yuma sector, where illegal border crossings in have declined by 70 percent from 2006, when the Yuma Sector built more than 50 miles of border wall.  President Trump instituted tough immigration policies that have reduced illegal border crossings over the southwest border by 47 percent compared to the same period last year.  Illegal aliens removed due to ICE arrests have increased by over 32 percent, to 48,580 illegal aliens, compared to the same time last year.  71 percent of the more than 91,000 administrative arrests conducted by ICE since President Trump‚Äôs inauguration have involved convicted criminal aliens.  Of the illegal aliens arrested without criminal convictions, 74 percent were charged with a crime, were immigration fugitives, or were repeat violators.  So far in fiscal year 2017, ICE has removed over 2,700 criminal gang members, compared to 2,057 criminal gang members in all of fiscal year 2016.  During Project New Dawn, a nationwide, six-week operation, ICE officers and agents arrested 1,378 suspected gang members. 104 of those arrested were members or associates of MS-13.  Operation Matador in the New York City metropolitan area has led to nearly 140 arrests, the vast majority affiliated with MS-13.  One of President Trump‚Äôs first Executive Orders informed sanctuary cities that failure to fully abide by Federal immigration laws would jeopardize access to certain Federal grant money. As a result, Miami-Dade County reversed its years-long sanctuary policies.  The President ordered the hiring of 10,000 new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents.  54 additional immigration judges have been hired since President Trump took office to speed up the removal of illegal aliens from the United States, and new immigration judges are hired every month.  President Trump ordered the creation of the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) office at DHS, ensuring victims of criminal acts by illegal aliens are no longer ignored by the Federal Government.","status",NA,NA,229,51,39,36,7,1,1,4

I had the privilege of hosting Sheriff Joe in Anderson, SC nearly a year ago today. I enjoyed the brief time I was able to spend with him, a man who has served his country in one uniform or another for his entire adult life. I know receiving this pardon will be a relief to him and his family, and I wish them all the very best.   A President's pardon power is not something to take lightly. The constitution gives the President broad authority to pardon individuals, and like all broad authority it has to potential to be abused and therefore must be respected and carefully scrutinized. However, in this particular case I believe the President used his power correctly and I strongly support his decision.   It is important for everyone to remember that all of Sheriff Arpaio's legal issues stem from a single area, trying to enforce the law when the federal government has fallen short of its legal obligations to secure our borders. For year's the federal government has failed to enforce our immigration laws, so much so that one point California sued the federal government in court claiming that the influx of illegal immigrants was so great that it constituted a foreign invasion.  The federal government has a responsibility to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws, yet for decades Presidents of both parties refused to make this issue a priority. The fact that illegal crossings on the southwest border are down 47% since President Trump came into office shows that a lot can be done as long in a short amount of time, as long as we have a President who is willing to make immigration enforcement a priority.  The truth of the matter is that the federal government has let our country down when it comes to fighting illegal immigration, and instead of focusing on the problem, they would rather punish those like Sheriff Arpaio who were willing to try to do something about it. That's disgraceful.  But even if you put all that aside, there's another strong legal reason to grant Sheriff Joe a pardon, and that's the fact that he was denied a trial by jury, a right that our Founding Fathers felt was very important. Federal criminal contempt charges are one of the very few legal issues in the United States where that right to a jury trial does not exist. Even if you disagree with the circumstances that led Sheriff Joe to be held in contempt, the issue of being denied the right to be judged by a jury of your peers should be concerning on a broader level. I'm hopeful that Sheriff Joe's pardon will increase awareness into this unique legal issue, and spark discussions in the legal community about whether giving that much power to a single judge is warranted in this country.","status",NA,NA,972,243,104,136,1,3,5,103

It got me thinking about the agenda that President Trump ran on and what it looks like.  Here is a synopsis:  - National security and securing a porous southern border.  This includes a comprehensive evaluation of our vetting process for refugees and visas, especially from terrorist stronghold countries during the President's pause on the flow of refugees from there.  - Tax Reform and lowering tax rates - allowing Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money.  - Putting Americans back to work and lessening their dependence on government assistance.  Working Americans helps two-fold: they shrink expenses of government and they pay taxes, thus increasing government revenue.  - Rebuilding of our military capability and readiness after years of sequestration and defense cuts.  We need planes, ships, parts, soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen as well.  - A strong foreign policy and the return to the Superpower that we can be and the world needs us to be.  - It will focus on spending reductions and addressing our $20 Trillion debt.  - Repealing the ACA (Obamacare) and replacing with less government-centered & controlled healthcare options while opening the door to free-market reforms that provide for competition and choice.  ""When companies compete, you save money.""  - Support for American energy development and projects like the Keystone Pipeline, Dakota Access pipeline, as well as LNG exports.  And doing those projects with American steel and American-made pipe.  - Bringing the American infrastructure into the 21st Century to support a growing 21st Century economy (growing based on the above) through an infrastructure package for rail, ports, interstate highways and water/sewer projects.    - On Tax reform, allowing the repatriation of overseas earnings by American companies will be a huge shot in the arm for the US economy!  Not sure the final expected tally - but believe over a Trillion dollars will come back to be reinvested in America (and taxed at a commonsense rate - like a one-time cash infusion in the US coffers).  We have already lessened the red-tape burden in so many ways through the Congressional Review Act bills which have been signed into law.  There are other items of course, but these are the biggies.  All the while dealing with a nuclear North Korea; nuclear ambitious Iran; terrorism targeting western interests by ISIS, al Qaeda and others; an imploding Venezuela here closer to home; migration from Latin America and elsewhere; what your tax dollars pay for and what they don't- like paying for gender-altering surgeries for military personnel; natural disasters like Hurricane Harvey; and a MSM which would rather focus on the shoes of the First Lady thatn the help the President has promised Texas.  I continue to look for ways to help President Trump Make America Great Again and move these agenda items - because I believe those things will truly help turn our nation around.  There are those who dislike President Trump.  He doesn't help when he mis-speaks, tweets or isn't clear in his rhetoric.  He isn't a polished, Obama-esque politician and orator.  But I believe the average Joe across America appreciates that.  And they appreciate that he is a ""street fighter"" so to speak.  President Trump has the American people's best interest at heart; the America which helped him be successful is what he wants to help others experience the same success; and a ""peace through strength"" approach to national security, defense and foreign policy is needed.  That is why I will continue to support a #MAGA hashtag.","status",NA,NA,239,124,45,53,7,0,1,10

After that, we will begin debate on the 8 remaining appropriations bills that the House has yet to take up (which have been rolled into a single bill). Unfortunately, with us being so close to the end of the fiscal year, I'm afraid Congress will likely pass another short term Continuing Resolution (CR) to fund government until December, expiring right before Christmas.

Another reason why Senate needs to pass Kate's law, so it can be sent to the President for his signature.  On September 14, 2017, Border Patrol agents arrested Miguel Angel Flores-Jimenez and Miguel Castro-Santiago, both illegal aliens from the country of Mexico. Flores-Jimenez and Castro-Santiago were arrested after they crossed the Rio Grande River and entered the United States illegally. Record checks revealed that in 2008, Flores-Jimenez was arrested and convicted for Lewd and Lascivious Sexual Battery on a Victim under 16 years of age in Jacksonville, FL. Flores-Jimenez was sentenced to 23 days in jail and 5 years of probation for this criminal act. After completing his sentence, Flores-Jimenez was deported from the United States in 2009.  The second subject, Castro-Santiago was identified as being previously arrested and convicted for Second Degree Murder in Montgomery County, Kansas. In 2005, Castro-Santiago was sentenced to 117 months in jail and ultimately deported from the United States after completing his sentence in 2013. Both subjects will be criminally prosecuted for illegal entry into the United States and will be removed from the country once criminal proceedings have been completed.  ‚ÄúThe arrest of these criminal aliens and preventing them from committing another heinous crime in the United States is one of many examples that illustrate how the United States Border Patrol keeps our communities safe,‚Äù said Laredo Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent Gabriel Acosta.","status",NA,NA,160,50,41,3,0,3,3,17

There were just a few Republican turncoats in the Senate and in the House who aren't willing to follow through on the clear promises that Republicans made to the American people to get rid of this horrible law. Those who lied about their desire to repeal Obamacare in order to be re-elected deserve to be thrown out of office, and I hope that you will assist them in that at the next available opportunity. Also deserving of blame are the Democrats who see Obamacare crumbling around them, see people suffering from double digit rate increases, and yet aren't willing to repeal this law and start over in a bipartisan way, or even worse, want more government interference in our daily lives by pushing for government run, socialized, single payer healthcare.  I've voted to repeal Obamacare, replace Obamacare, defund Obamacare, and challenge the constitutionality of Obamacare. I've also stood up in Republican conference meetings to encourage my colleagues to do the right thing. I've done everything I could to get this across the finish line, and I am saddened that a few wishy-washy moderates weren't willing to follow through on their campaign promises. It's shameful. I'm mad, and you have every right to be mad as well.  Now we officially start the process of passing tax reform. Tomorrow House Republicans are holding a rare half day conference on tax reform, and we will be joined by Vice President Pence. The first step will be to pass a budget for the new fiscal year. Once that is done, we will be free to use the reconciliation process on a tax reform package that cannot be filibustered. From there we have the difficult task of all hammering out the final details on what a tax reform package will look like. I believe we're all in agreement that we need a tax code that is fairer, flatter, simpler, and makes America more competitive. But the devil is in the details. Which tax deductions will stay and which ones will be eliminated? How much are we willing to cut? And the big issue that I am concerned with: after we've cut taxes, how are we going to address government spending?  I'm looking forward to the tax reform debate, and as always, I welcome your feedback. -Jeff","status",NA,NA,253,238,53,7,10,4,27,60

Sir,  I am writing in hopes that you will carry my message to Washington. In XXXX my husband was murdered in our home by three people. These people broke into our home to steal and my husband walked in on them and they shot him five times.  I was left to raise our two boys (ages X and X) by myself. I remember being angry because I lost not just my husband but my best friend. And even more angry that my son's would never have the opportunity to learn from their dad.  Through the years and today, not one time have I ever blamed my husbands murder on the gun that was used to kill him. My blame will always be on the people who pulled the trigger. The gun could not have killed my husband by itself.  I also believe if my husband would have been packing a gun when he entered our home that day he would still be with us today.  Guns do not kill people. Hatred, drugs and mean spirited people kill other people. Taking our rights to bear arms away from us will only give these type people more ammunition. The law abiding citizens will end up suffering more.  I speak from someone who experienced the murder of a loved one and someone who has lived a life surrounded by avid hunters.  In memory of my late husband who was also an avid hunter, I will fight to the end to keep our full 2nd Amendment rights.  And as a side note, I work in 911 Emergency Communications and I hear these type calls all the time, including active shooter calls. Again these are no different. It is not the gun it is the people who choose to pull the trigger.  I'm looking for your support and leadership in Washington on this issue and I'm asking that you fight the fight for us.  Thank you.","status",NA,NA,561,89,100,75,0,4,22,5

It means that you think you know better than the people who elected you, or have become susceptible to self promotion and flattery.  Senator Flake announced that he's not running for re-election. The media covered his bashing of the President, but what they did not focus on enough was his own admission that if he ran he would lose. Why? Because the people support President Trump and his agenda, and Senator Flake does not. He has taken it upon himself to say that when it comes to immigration, trade, border security, and other issues, he knows what's best, not the people of Arizona. Is that the mentality of a public servant? I certainly don't think so.  When I came to Washington, I said I wasn't going to drink the water up here. I had no interest in becoming part of the Swamp. I made it very clear that I was here to represent the people of South Carolina, not to make friends. I've fought both Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner to make sure we uphold the constitution, and return our government to the people.  One of the many things I've done to remind myself of that commitment is to keep this story over the water cooler in my office.  Jeff Flake? He drank the water in Washington, and became part of the swamp in the process. He screwed up by abandoning the conservative principles that got him elected and now he wants to blame President Trump? Give me a break.  President Trump and Vice President Pence are the only two people in our Democratic Republic who were elected by voters across all 50 states. They have a mandate from the people, and that means something to me. The nature of how they won means something to me as well. They won even though they were out spent and out organized by Democrats and the Clinton machine. They won even though the media was against them. They won in states that Republicans hadn't won in decades, and they won with the support of people from both parties.  Imagine what we could accomplish as a country if Republicans in the House and Senate actually supported the President and his mandate? A more secure nation, a stronger military, tax reform, economic growth, and job creation.  Washington tends to have an aura of self-importance to it. The town is filled with big egos, and even bigger ambitions. Maybe that's why it's hard to remember that being in elected office isn't supposed to be about you (the elected official), it's about the people, and their wants and desires.  It's time to get the egos out of the way. It's time to support President Trump and his agenda for the people.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJeffDuncan/photos/a.188882864462807.45546.187268144624279/1921132931237783/?type=3",NA,486,205,123,101,6,4,1,25

Donald J. Trump isn't a politician. That is what the American voters liked about him.  Yes, he said some things during his days as a Democrat that you would not want your President, brother, husband, son or best friend to utter.  Yes, he seems to over-react to things that are said about him, usually on Twitter, especially when those attacks come from people like Senator Jeff Flake within our own party.  But America..........this nation has problems. And the American voters looked to a non-traditional, successful businessman to help right the ship.  The same voters had given us the US House, then the US Senate - without seeing the expected results versus the big government, less liberty policies of President Barack Obama.  Donald J. Trump, now the 45th President of the United States, ran on a simple Make America Great Again agenda #MAGA.  The American people didn't embrace someone they hoped would be a Nobel Peace Prize winning, smooth talking, appeasement-minded apologist of the historical American greatness.  We already had that and are $20 Trillion in debt with big government programs driving the spending train in DC.  The American people elected President Trump, knowing full-well his non-traditional methods and actions.  It is time for the anti-Trump Republicans to get over it and embrace, not the POTUS, but the AGENDA that the American people support and voted for:  -Repeal Obamacare and get government out of the relationship between us and our doctors.  Repeal.  -National Security begins, for a sovereign nation, with border security and enforcement of the law. Time to secure the weak under-belly of our nation - our southern border.  -National Defense.  Sequestration continues to hurt our defense readiness and capability.  We seem to be able to find cuts to the Constitutional role of defense but never can find cuts to the social programs that, being on auto-pilot, are continuing to cause deficits and debt.  It is time to return to the Superpower that the world needs America to be!  -Tax Reform.  Americans, after 31 years, deserve to keep more of their paychecks at the end of the month, businesses deserve to keep more of the profits they create - for reinvestment, debt reduction or dividends to the investors who took the risk by believing in them. The US Tax Code is 73,954 pages.  The US Constitution (4,543 words) is four pages.  -Repatriation of overseas earnings by American Corporations at a fair tax rate.  Possibly more than a Trillion dollars sits offshore in ghe accounts of American businesses who haven't brought those earnings back due to the oppressive confiscatory tax rates which would apply.  A fair tax rate creates a wind-fall in tax revenue for government while also creating a huge cash infusion into the American economy!  Economic activity and job growth!  -A 21st Century infrastructure plan to address a 21st Century economy.  Keep pork-barrel spending out of it and spend money where needed to support this future economic growth.  It is a spending bill, but would pay for itself with a growing, robust economy.  These are the highlights of a #MAGA agenda which I support.  I wonder what part of this Agenda Senators Flake, Corker, Collins, McCain - and Republican colleagues in the House - disagree with?  Just think what we could accomplish for America if we truly supported this #MAGA agenda, regardless of personal feelings about the guy occupying 1600 Pennsylvania Ave!","status",NA,NA,649,290,137,157,9,2,4,23

It is outrageous and shocking that a federal agency would go after a whole political ideology with heightened tax scrutiny. I have long been advocating for current IRS Commissioner John Koskinen‚Äôs impeachment since he proudly led the department during these discriminatory acts. He has never wanted to comply with congressional inquiries due to his corruption and dishonesty, and I believe justice still needs to be served. The settlements with these targeted groups are a positive step forward even though many have spent enormous amounts of time and money to fight off liberal discrimination. In my own congressional district, the Laurens County Tea Party was targeted by the IRS, and their leader, Dianne Belsom, boldly testified before Congress in 2013 to explain the heightened tax scrutiny to lawmakers.   Thankfully, we do not have to deal with Mr. Koskinen too much longer. I am pleased to see President Trump pick a new acting IRS leader, David Kautter, who will take the job in November. Koskinen‚Äôs reign of corruption is coming to an end, and he won‚Äôt be missed.","link","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/26/trump-doj-settles-lawsuits-over-tea-party-targeting-by-obama-irs.html","foxnews.com",126,54,38,6,2,2,1,13

(**House Intelligence Committee has secured agreement with Fusion GPS for bank documents**)  By Kimberley A. Strassel Oct. 27, 2017  The confirmation this week that Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid an opposition-research firm for a ‚Äúdossier‚Äù on Donald Trump is bombshell news. More bombshells are to come.  The Fusion GPS saga isn‚Äôt over. The Clinton-DNC funding is but a first glimpse into the shady election doings concealed within that oppo-research firm‚Äôs walls. We now know where Fusion got some of its cash, but the next question is how the firm used it. With whom did it work beyond former British spy Christopher Steele ? Whom did it pay? Who else was paying it?  The answers are in Fusion‚Äôs bank records. Fusion has doggedly refused to divulge the names of its clients for months now, despite extraordinary pressure. So why did the firm suddenly insist that middleman law firm Perkins Coie release Fusion from confidentiality agreements, and spill the beans on who hired it?  Because there‚Äôs something Fusion cares about keeping secret even more than the Clinton-DNC news‚Äîand that something is in those bank records. The release of the client names was a last-ditch effort to appease the House Intelligence Committee, which issued subpoenas to Fusion‚Äôs bank and was close to obtaining records until Fusion filed suit last week. The release was also likely aimed at currying favor with the court, given Fusion‚Äôs otherwise weak legal case. The judge could rule as early as Friday morning.  If the House wins, don‚Äôt be surprised if those records include money connected to Russians. In the past Fusion has worked with Russians, including lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who happened to show up last year in Donald Trump Jr.‚Äôs office.  FBI bombshells are also yet to come. The bureau has stonewalled congressional subpoenas for documents related to the dossier, but that became harder with the DNC-Clinton news. On Thursday Speaker Paul Ryan announced the FBI had finally pledged to turn over its dossier file next week.  Assuming the FBI is comprehensive in its disclosure, expect to learn that the dossier was indeed a major basis of investigating the Trump team‚Äîdespite reading like ‚Äúthe National Enquirer,‚Äù as Rep. Trey Gowdy aptly put it. We may learn the FBI knew the dossier was a bought-and-paid-for product of Candidate Clinton, but used it anyway. Or that it didn‚Äôt know, which would be equally disturbing.  It might show the bureau was simply had. Don‚Äôt forget that it wasn‚Äôt until January the dossier became public, and the media started unearthing details. And the more ugly info that came out (Fusion, Democratic clients, intelligence-for-hire) the more former Obama officials seemed skeptical of it. In May, former Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper said his people could never ‚Äúcorroborate‚Äù its ‚Äúsourcing.‚Äù In June, Mr. Comey derided it as ‚Äúsalacious and unverified.‚Äù  Yet none of this jibes with reports that the FBI debated paying Mr. Steele to continue his work. Or that Mr. Comey was so convinced by the dossier that he pushed to have it included in the intelligence community‚Äôs January report on Russian meddling. Imagine if it turns out the FBI was duped by a politically contracted document that might have been filled up by the Kremlin.  There‚Äôs plenty yet to come with regard to the DNC and the Clinton campaign. Every senior Democrat is disclaiming knowledge of the dossier deal, leaving Perkins Coie holding the bag. But while it is not unusual for law firms to hire opposition-research outfits for political clients, it is highly unusual for a law firm to pay bills without a client‚Äôs approval. Somewhere, Perkins Coie has documents showing who signed off on those bills, and they aren‚Äôt protected by attorney-client privilege.  Those names will matter, since someone at the DNC and at the Clinton campaign will need to explain how they somehow both forgot to list Fusion as a vendor in their campaign-finance filings. Some Justice Department lawyer is presumably already looking into whether this was a willful evasion, which can carry criminal penalties. It‚Äôs one thing to forget to list that local hot-dog supplier for the campaign picnic. It‚Äôs a little fishier when two entities both fail to list the firm that supplied them the most explosive hit job in a generation.  And there are still bombshells with regard to unmasking of Americans in surveilled communications. If the Steele dossier reports (which appear to date back to June 2016) were making their way into the hands of senior DNC and Clinton political operatives, you can bet they were making their way to the Obama White House. This may explain why Obama political appointees began monitoring the Trump campaign and abusing unmasking. They were looking for a ‚Äúgotcha,‚Äù something to disqualify a Trump presidency. Of course, they were doing so on the basis of ‚Äúsalacious and unverified‚Äù accusations made by anonymous Russians, but never mind.  No, this probe of the Democratic Party‚Äôs Russian dalliance has a long, long way to go. And, let us hope, with revelations too big for even the media to ignore.","status",NA,NA,151,103,60,15,4,12,0,3

He tried to mask it as just lecturing Republicans, but what he actually did was belittle everyone who disagreed with him. If you wanted a secure border, or were concerned about Islamic terrorism you were a racist. If you wanted the federal government less involved in our daily lives you were heartless. If you questioned the narrative that the President was pushing you were uneducated.  There's been an effort in this country to shame people into holding certain beliefs, and assign labels to those who do not conform to the standard set by the establishment, the elites, Wall Street, the Swamp, the media, ect.   The 2016 Presidential election was about a lot of different things, but I firmly believe that at least one component was the rejection of the snobbish liberal elitism that has crept into our country.  And when I see political ads like this one that reflect that elitism, which appeared recently in the Virginia governor's race, it angers me to my core.  Yesterday, New York City was attacked by an Islamic terrorist immigrant. Yes, it is common sense that we should be able to talk about our immigration vetting processes, how many people we bring into our country, and how we are fighting Islamic terrorism. No, that does not make you a racist.  We have MILLIONS of people living in our country illegally. People who have broken our laws and violated our national sovereignty. Yes, it is perfectly reasonable to be concerned about this and support legislation to stop the problem. No, that does not make you a racist.  I'm glad we have a President like Trump, while he does not always say things in the best way, refuses to be held hostage to the liberal shaming game when we need to be having grown up conversations about these important issues.","link","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0thehNSUbc","youtube.com",329,149,67,51,8,2,3,32

Sayfullo Saipov, a 29 year old Uzbek native, brutally murdered eight and injured twelve people on Tuesday during his radicalized rampage. He planned this terrorist attack for over a year and pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. He told investigators that ""he felt good about what he had done"" while also asking for an ISIS flag to be hung in his hospital room.   He came to the U.S. on a ‚Äúdiversity visa‚Äù which is a program for immigrants coming from counties that have historically-low rates of immigration to the U.S. (like Uzbekistan). Many countries that utilize these visas have poor (or nonexistent) record keeping with high possibilities for fraud and abuse. He also reportedly brought 23 relatives with him due to nonsensical chain migration. This man had been radicalized, and we let him and his family members in our country to score diversity points.    This whole situation is sickening, and political correctness has brought us to this point.

They would rather be politically correct than face the fact that there are people in this world who want to destroy us.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help all Americans take home more of their paychecks while stimulating the economy, creating jobs, and fostering a fairer tax code for the middle class. I am still reviewing the bill, but so far I like what I see. Let me know your thoughts! Here are a few highlights from Ways and Means.  For individuals and families: - Lowers individual tax rates for low- and middle-income Americans to Zero, 12%, 25%, and 35% so people can keep more of the money they earn throughout their lives, and continues to maintain 39.6% for high-income Americans. - Significantly increases the standard deduction to protect roughly double the amount of what you earn each year from taxes ‚Äì from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals and $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples. - Eliminates special-interest deductions that increase rates and complicate Americans‚Äô taxes ‚Äì so an individual or family can file their taxes on a form as simple as a postcard. - Takes action to support more American families establishing a new Family Credit ‚Äì which includes expanding the Child Tax Credit and preserving the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to help families care for their children and older dependents such as a disabled grandparent who may need additional support. - Preserves the Earned Income Tax Credit to provide important tax relief for low-income Americans working to build better lives for themselves. - Streamlines higher education benefits to help families save for and better afford college tuition and other education expenses. - Continues the deduction for charitable contributions so people can continue to donate to their local church, charity, or community organization. - Preserves the home mortgage interest deduction for existing mortgages and maintains the home mortgage interest deduction for newly purchased homes up to $500,000 ‚Äì providing tax relief to current and aspiring homeowners. - Continues to allow people to write off the cost of state and local property taxes up to $10,000. - Retains popular retirement savings options such as 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts so Americans can continue to save for their future. - Repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax so millions of individuals and families will no longer have to worry about calculating their taxes twice each year and pay the higher amount. - Provides immediate relief from the Death Tax by doubling the exemption and repealing the Death Tax after six years. Family-owned farms and businesses will no longer have to worry about double or triple taxation from Washington when they pass down their life‚Äôs work to the next generation.  For job creators of all sizes:  - Lowers the corporate tax rate to 20% ‚Äì down from 35%, which today is the highest in the industrialized world ‚Äì the largest reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate in our nation‚Äôs history. - Reduces the tax rate on the hard-earned business income of Main Street job creators to no more than 25%‚Äì the lowest tax rate on small business income since World War II. - Establishes strong safeguards to distinguish between individual wage income and ‚Äúpass-through‚Äù business income so Main Street tax relief goes to the local job creators it was designed to help most. - Allows businesses to immediately write off the full cost of new equipment to improve operations and enhance the skills of their workers ‚Äì unleashing the growth of jobs, productivity, and paychecks. - Protects the ability of small businesses to write off the interest on loans that help these Main Street entrepreneurs start or expand a business, hire workers, and increase paychecks. - Retains the low-income housing tax credit that encourages businesses to invest in affordable housing so families, individuals, and seniors can find a safe and comfortable place to call home. - Preserves the Research & Development Tax Credit ‚Äì encouraging our businesses and workers to develop cutting-edge ‚ÄúMade in America‚Äù products and services. - Strengthens accountability rules for tax-exempt organizations to ensure the churches, charities, foundations, and other organizations receiving tax-exempt status are focused on helping people and communities in need. - Modernizes our international tax system so America‚Äôs global businesses will no longer be held back by an outdated ‚Äúworldwide‚Äù tax system that results in double taxation for many of our nation‚Äôs job creators. - Makes it easier and far less costly for American businesses to bring home foreign earnings to invest in growing jobs and paychecks in our local communities. - Prevents American jobs, headquarters, and research from moving overseas by eliminating incentives that now reward companies for shifting jobs, profits, and manufacturing plants abroad.","link","https://fairandsimple.gop/","fairandsimple.gop",146,95,34,21,2,0,0,16

I thought it might be helpful to answer a few of the frequently asked questions I have been getting:   Q: Is this closing loopholes? A: Yes. This legislation is closing dozens of complex loopholes for special interests.   Q: What‚Äôs happening with the mortgage interest deduction? A: If you currently hold a mortgage, your deduction will not be changed.  Starting next year, under this legislation, your deduction on any new mortgage will be capped to the interest that applies to the first $500,000 of your mortgage debt. In 2016, the average amount of mortgage debt was $156,150 in South Carolina.   Q: What‚Äôs happening with the state and local tax deduction? A: Low-tax areas like ours subsidize high-tax areas like New York, Boston, Washington DC, and San Francisco. Under this legislation, we are cutting rates across the board and eliminating that deduction ‚Äì which will stop South Carolina from subsidizing Manhattan‚Äôs high taxes. Check out this map to see a county-by-county breakdown: https://static.taxfoundation.org/state-local-deductions-2014/index.html   Q: Is this tax reform retroactive?  Will it sunset like the Bush tax cuts did, setting up some future cliff? A: No. This is permanent reform that would take effect with the 2018 Tax Year.  Q: Does this tax reform end football tax subsidies? A: Yes. This bill stops NFL teams from getting tax free bonds to build stadiums.  Q: What about charitable contributions? A: There are some technical changes on making sure that cash donations get receipts but the deduction will stand.  We believe it‚Äôs more important that private and non-profit institutions help people than having the federal government do it. Regular people know how to help other people far more effectively than bureaucrats do.  Q: What about education? A: This reform keeps and consolidates education tax credits, expanding 529s to cover elementary and secondary education, and allowing 529s to be created for as-yet-unborn children. It also allows credits for tuition which will save college parents thousands every year.  Q: Why do away with exemptions?  A: To simplify the system. To make up for this, the standard deduction is being doubled and indexed to inflation, the lowest bracket (of 12%) is being expanded to the first $90,000 of income, and the child tax credit is increased to $1,600. For most families, that‚Äôs going to result in an overall savings of around $1,280/year.  Q: Doesn‚Äôt cutting the corporate rate only help the rich? A: Not at all. Most economists agree that the cut to the corporate rate will result in higher wages for American workers, an average raise of $3,000/year. They also estimate that the corporate reforms will add 1 million American jobs over the next few years. That amounts to an overall increase of around 5% to GDP.  Q: What happens to Social Security? A: This bill doesn‚Äôt impact Social Security, benefit recipients, or payroll taxes.   Q: What about Obamacare taxes? A: I would love to get rid of those, in this bill or any other.  The decision (for now) seems to be to avoid complicating this bill with the Obamacare tax issues, but handling those in a health care specific bill. I‚Äôve asked our Leadership to specifically kill the medical device tax, the health insurance tax, and the net investment tax, but so far that‚Äôs not being included in this discussion.  Q: Why can‚Äôt you go to just a Flat Tax/Fair Tax approach? A: I am a cosponsor of H.R. 25, the Fair Tax Act of 2017, and I am a supporter of both Fair Tax and Flat Tax approaches. However, there weren‚Äôt enough cosponsors on H.R. 25 for it to be part of the discussion. The more deductions we can eliminate, the better off we will be to ensure a fairer and flatter system for all Americans.","status",NA,NA,147,97,63,13,1,0,0,9

Sixteen years later, ‚ÄúGlenda‚Äôs Gardening and Landscape‚Äù has 41 workers, serves three counties in the area, and is expected to earn $500,000 in net income this year. Under today‚Äôs broken tax code, where small business income is taxed at individual rates, Glenda and her husband will personally be taxed on everything earned by the company. That means paying taxes at individual wage rates, with an income tax bill of about $128,000. With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Glenda, her family, and her business will see some much-needed tax relief. Her net business income will be taxed at a low maximum rate of 25%, which in combination with no Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) will reduce her tax bill by about $25,000.

Example of a Main Street Startup Company Making $62,000 in Income  Tom always dreamed of opening his own bakery.

I've talked about the benefits of eliminating deductions and loopholes in exchange for lowering the overall rates.  However, there was an important part of the overall discussion that was left out. Isn't it telling that so many financial decisions from individuals, families, and businesses are made with taxes in mind? Shouldn't that be a warning sign in itself that our government is too big, takes too much of our money, and is too involved in our daily lives?  If a business is making decisions about whether to set up operations in the United States or move them overseas based on taxes, that's a problem. If a family of four, or a retired couple, are making tax policy the top consideration on what to do financially, that's a problem.  I have always said that my goal is to create a fairer, flatter, simpler tax code that empowers the individual and lowers the impact of the government. I believe the House passed bill is a step in that direction.

My thoughts are in parentheses.  1. Keeping the lights on: ‚ÄúBoth sides have floated the possibility of a short-term stopgap to push negotiations (from Dec. 8) until just before Christmas. But informal talks have been abortive,‚Äù Mike DeBonis and Ed O‚ÄôKeefe report. ‚ÄúThe first step toward a resolution will be reaching an agreement on government spending levels for 2018 and perhaps beyond, lifting caps imposed under a bipartisan 2011 budget deal. ‚Ä¶ Under current law, Congress may appropriate no more than $549 billion for defense programs and $516 billion for nondefense programs next year, a cut from current levels. But the Trump administration and defense hawks want to boost defense spending to more than $600 billion, and Democrats are demanding a dollar-for-dollar increase in nondefense spending.  ‚ÄúTalks before the Thanksgiving holiday focused on raising spending levels somewhere between $180 billion and $200 billion over the next two fiscal years combined but went nowhere ‚Ä¶ Aides from both parties warned that if a spending accord is not reached this week, hopes for the passage of a broad appropriations bill before Christmas would be dim.‚Äù   (We're $20 trillion in debt. National defense is a constitutional role of the federal government. We shouldn't have to spend more in non-constitutionally appropriate areas, to live up to our commitment to our military. We need to be cutting spending, not growing it. Also, I hate these stop gap measures. Congress needs to get their act together and get these things done on time.)   2. The House and Senate must reconcile their tax plans. Senate Republicans are seriously considering several last-minute changes to their tax bill to win over reluctant lawmakers ahead of critical votes planned for this week. ‚ÄúThe lawmakers attracting the most concern from leadership and the White House are Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who say the current version of the bill favors corporations over other businesses,‚Äù Damian Paletta reports. ‚ÄúThere are numerous members demanding changes, and their needs don‚Äôt all overlap. Together, the requests put Republican leaders in a difficult position, as they attempt to accommodate individual holdouts on a one-off basis without losing other members or creating a situation in which the bill collapses under the weight of disparate demands. At least six GOP members have raised concerns about specific provisions in the GOP tax bill, though none has flatly said they plan to vote against it this week. Johnson came closest, saying he opposed the measure but later suggesting he could support it with changes.""  Another change under consideration: Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) wants to allow Americans to deduct $10,000 in local property taxes from their taxable income. ‚ÄúThis provision was in a bill that passed the House ‚Ä¶ but it is not in the Senate bill. Though Collins has voiced the most concerns about its absence, other members have quietly said they also want the change to be made,‚Äù per Damian. ‚ÄúMaking this change could cost more than $100 billion over 10 years and would probably require Republicans to find new money to offset it. ‚Ä¶ The total size of the tax plan cannot be more than $1.5 trillion over a decade, so adding new benefits could force Republicans to find ways to raise additional revenue. Presently, they only have roughly $80 billion in wiggle room to use, a small sum because many of the changes would be spread out over 10 years.‚Äù (Remember that well planned tax cuts result in an increase in economic activity, which results in more, not less, tax revenue. These government scores fail to calculate that).   3. Several big health-care issues are in the mix. Democrats would like for the year-end spending bill to stabilize the insurance markets by restoring the cost-sharing reduction payments that President Trump cut off, and there‚Äôs a bipartisan measure co-authored by Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) that would accomplish this. But many on the right see it as a bailout for insurance companies, and Democrats say they won‚Äôt back a CSR fix if it‚Äôs paired with a repeal of the individual mandate ‚Äì a provision that continues to be in the Senate GOP‚Äôs tax bill.  Separately, Congress allowed the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program to lapse on Sept. 30 and must reauthorize it to prevent another 9 million kids from losing coverage. States have been using stop-gap measures to keep programs going, but several say they cannot keep doing so for much longer. (The House passed an extension to CHIP, just waiting on the Senate to Act. There's a lot of debate on the market stabilization issue).  4. Offsets for disaster appropriations? The White House has asked for another $44 billion to finance the federal response to this year‚Äôs natural disasters ‚Äì including three hurricanes and the wildfires in the West ‚Äì but it wants Congress to offset this new spending with cuts elsewhere. That‚Äôs going to be a non-starter. (Disaster relief should always be offset. Otherwise we will never make progress in addressing out debt and deficit. It's a matter of setting priorities and recognizing we have limited resources).  5. FISA must be reauthorized: The federal law that allows intelligence agencies to gather foreign electronic communications on U.S. soil will expire Dec. 31, potentially taking away what the National Security Agency has called ‚Äúthe single most important operational statute‚Äù at its disposal unless Congress acts to renew it. ‚ÄúSeveral lawmakers want to constrain the government‚Äôs authority to search intelligence gathered under the program for information about Americans,‚Äù per Mike and Ed. ‚ÄúWhile there are bipartisan bills to revise and extend the law, no agreement has been reached to advance them.‚Äù (We must protect the civil liberties of American citizens)","status",NA,NA,35,34,8,1,0,0,0,0

Schmidt, a United States Marine.    ‚ÄôTwas the night before Christmas,  he lived all alone  in a one bedroom house  made of plaster and stone.  I had come down the chimney  with presents to give,  and to see just who  in this home did live.  I looked all about,  a strange sight I did see,  no tinsel, no presents,  not even a tree.  No stocking by mantle,  just boots filled with sand,  on the wall hung pictures  of far distant lands.  With medals and badges,  awards of all kinds,  a sober thought  came through my mind.  For this house was different,  it was dark and dreary;  I found the home of a soldier,  once I could see clearly.  The soldier lay sleeping,  silent, alone,  curled up on the floor  in this one bedroom home.  The face was so gentle,  the room in such disorder,  not how i pictured  a United States soldier.  Was this the hero  of whom I‚Äôd just read?  Curled up on a poncho,  the floor for a bed?  I realized the families  that I saw this night,  owed their lives to these soldiers  who were willing to fight.  Soon round the world,  the children would play,  and grownups would celebrate   a bright Christmas day.  They all enjoyed freedom  each month of the year,  because of the soldiers,   like the one lying here.  I couldn't help wonder  how many lay alone,  on a cold Christmas eve  in a land far from home.  The very thought  brought a tear to my eye,  I dropped to my knees  and started to cry.  The soldier awakened  and I heard a rough voice,  ""Santa don't cry,  this life is my choice;  I fight for freedom,  I don't ask for more,  my life is my god,  my country, my corps.""  The soldier rolled over  and drifted to sleep,  I couldn't control it,  I continued to weep.  I kept watch for hours,  so silent and still  and we both shivered  from the cold night's chill.  I didn't want to leave  on that cold, dark, night,  this guardian of honor  so willing to fight.  Then the soldier rolled over,  with a voice soft and pure,  whispered, ""carry on Santa,   it's Christmas day, all is secure.""  One look at my watch,  and i knew he was right.  ""Merry Christmas, my friend,   and to all a good night.""","status",NA,NA,56,14,40,16,0,0,3,0

As I have said for years, our immigration system opens our country up to great danger. I‚Äôve introduced legislation like the Terrorist Deportation Act that would bar entry into the US or demand removal of foreigners suspected of terrorism. As important and as common sense as that legislation is, even that would likely not have made a difference in this attack because of the terrorist‚Äôs legal status as a green card holder alone.   Once we grant someone residency, it is extremely difficult to legally remove them from the country, even if we suspect them of wrongdoing. That is why we as a nation have to be so careful about who we allow to come into this country. We are at war with radical Islamic terrorism. Europe is under constant threat. Unless we are willing to take some serious steps now to safeguard our country, I am fearful that we will soon be sharing the fate of countries like France, the United Kingdom, and Germany.   I continue to reaffirm my support for President Trump‚Äôs travel ban, and the elimination of uncontrolled chain migration into the United States (positions I held before President Trump took office by the way.)

I am a strong believer in an open internet, free of excessive government regulation and control. That is precisely why I support the decision by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) yesterday to free the internet of 1930-styled regulations that were imposed upon it by the Obama Administration that are responsible for reducing critical broadband investment crucial for the rural Third District and South Carolina as a whole.  The vote taken by the FCC yesterday returns the internet to the same regulations it had been under until the Obama Administration acted heavy-handedly and without Congress to reclassify the internet under a 1930‚Äôs era law intended to regulate telephone companies. Since the decision in 2015 to regulate the internet like a public utility, we have seen broadband investment fall two years in a row, the first drop in investment in American history outside of a recession. The internet is one of the best free-market success stories of our day, and its rapid growth is a testament to less government interference, not more. Simply put, the government shouldn‚Äôt be in the business of picking winners and losers, stiflingly entrepreneurship, or discouraging private investment.  There have been a lot of misconceptions surrounding this decision. During the eruption of the internet in the 1990s, President Clinton and a Republican Congress adopted a policy of a free and open internet ‚Äúunfettered by federal or state regulation.‚Äù This light-touch, market-based approach to internet governance was successfully implemented by the Clinton Administration and upheld by the Bush Administration. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ruled that internet service providers (ISPs) and internet content providers should be regulated the same way. ISPs refer to companies that provide internet access (Verizon, AT&T, Charter) whereas internet content providers handle the distribution of online content (Facebook, Google, Netflix, Amazon).  In 2015, the Obama FCC reversed decades of precedent and exercised a stunning power grab by reclassifying ISPs as common carriers, making them subject to Title II regulation of the Communications Act of 1934.  Yesterday‚Äôs vote taken by the FCC was to restore internet regulations back to the pre-2015 standards, the same free-market approach that has spurred internet innovation and investment for the last several decades. The vote yesterday is not ending the internet (what you will hear from George Soros backed groups and from those who want more government control over your life), but simply returning ISPs to be regulated how they always were before Obama‚Äôs abuse of power.  This is not a big guy vs. little guy fight, as some of attempted to frame the debate. Google, Facebook, Netflix, and others were all once small start-ups that had a chance to compete without the government picking winners and losers.  It‚Äôs important that we talk about this issue truthfully. We can‚Äôt let this be a political football - reclassifying the internet differently with each new Commissioner and Administration that comes along in the future. That‚Äôs bad for the economy and undermines the democratic process by circumventing Congress. And if a consensus is reached that new regulations are warranted to keep the internet free and open, those tough decisions should be made by the people‚Äôs representatives, not by unelected bureaucrats in Washington, DC. Trying to fit a square peg in a round hole by applying 1930‚Äôs era laws to something as new and modern as the internet is more than bad politics, it‚Äôs also bad policy.","status",NA,NA,341,195,122,41,3,2,3,58

Here it is for your consideration:  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) overhauls America‚Äôs tax code to deliver historic tax relief for workers, families and job creators, and revitalize our nation‚Äôs economy. By lowering taxes across the board, eliminating costly special-interest tax breaks, and modernizing our international tax system, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help create more jobs, increase paychecks, and make the tax code simpler and fairer for Americans of all walks of life. With this bill, the typical family of four earning the median family income of $73,000 will receive a tax cut of $2,059  For individuals and families, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:  ‚Ä¢    Lowers individual taxes and sets the rates at 0%, 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37% so people can keep more of their hard-earned money.  ‚Ä¢ Significantly increases the standard deduction to protect roughly double the amount of what you earn each year from taxes ‚Äì from $6,350 and $12,700 under current law to $12,000 and $24,000 for individuals and married  couples, respectively.  ‚Ä¢    Continues to allow people to write off the cost of state and local taxes ‚Äì just like current law ‚Äì up to $10,000. Gives individuals and families the ability to choose among sales, income and property taxes to best fit their unique circumstances.  ‚Ä¢    Expands the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000 for single filers and married couples to help parents with the cost of raising children. The tax credit is fully refundable up to $1,400 and begins to phase-out for families making over $400,000. Parents must provide a child‚Äôs valid Social Security Number in order to receive this credit.  ‚Ä¢    Preserving the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to help families care for their children and older dependents such as a disabled grandparent who may need additional support.  ‚Ä¢    Preserving the Adoption Tax Credit so parents can continue to receive additional tax relief as they open their hearts and homes to an adopted child.  ‚Ä¢    Preserves the mortgage interest deduction ‚Äì providing tax relief to current and aspiring homeowners.  ‚Ä¢    For all homeowners with existing mortgages that were taken out to buy a home, there will be no change to the current mortgage interest deduction.  ‚Ä¢ For homeowners with new mortgages on a first or second home, the home mortgage interest deduction will be available up to $750,000.  ‚Ä¢    Provides relief for Americans with expensive medical bills by expanding the medical expense deduction for 2018 and 2019 for medical expenses exceeding 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income, and rising to 10 percent beginning in 2020.  ‚Ä¢    Continues and expands the deduction for charitable contributions so people can continue to donate to their local church, charity, or community organization.  ‚Ä¢ Eliminates Obamacare‚Äôs individual mandate penalty tax ‚Äì providing families with much-needed relief and flexibility to buy the health care that‚Äôs right for them if they choose.  ‚Ä¢    Maintains the Earned Income Tax Credit to provide important tax relief for low-income Americans working to build better lives for themselves.   ‚Ä¢    Improves savings vehicles for education by allowing families to use 529 accounts to save for elementary, secondary and higher education.  ‚Ä¢    Provides support for graduate students by continuing to exempt the value of reduced tuition from taxes.    POLICY HIGHLIGHTS:  ‚Ä¢    Retains popular retirement savings options such as 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) so Americans can continue to save for their future.  ‚Ä¢    Increases the exemption amount from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) to reduce the complexity and tax burden for millions of Americans.  ‚Ä¢ Provides immediate relief from the Death Tax by doubling the amount of the current exemption to reduce uncertainty and costs for many family-owned farms and businesses when they pass down their life‚Äôs work to the next generation.  For job creators of all sizes, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:  ‚Ä¢    Lowers the corporate tax rate to 21% (beginning Jan. 1, 2018) ‚Äì down from 35%, which today is the highest in the industrialized world ‚Äì the largest reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate in our nation‚Äôs history.  ‚Ä¢ Delivers significant tax relief to Main Street job creators by offering a first-ever 20% tax deduction that applies to the first $315,000 of joint income earned by all businesses organized as S corporations, partnerships, LLCs, and sole proprietorships. For Main Street job creators with income above this level, the bill generally provides a deduction for up to 20% on business profits ‚Äì reducing their effective marginal tax rate to no more than 29.6%.  ‚Ä¢    Establishing strong safeguards so that wage income does not receive the lower marginal effective tax rates on business income ‚Äì helping to ensure that Main Street tax relief goes to the local job creators it was designed to help most.  ‚Ä¢ Allows businesses to immediately write off the full cost of new equipment to improve operations and enhance the skills of their workers ‚Äì unleashing growth of jobs, productivity, and paychecks.  ‚Ä¢ Protects the ability of small businesses to write off interest on loans, helping these Main Street entrepreneurs start or expand a business, hire workers, and increase paychecks.  ‚Ä¢ Preserves important elements of the existing business tax system, including: Retaining the low-income housing tax credit that encourages businesses to invest in affordable housing so families, individuals, and seniors can find a safe and comfortable place to call home.  ‚Ä¢    Preserving the Research & Development Tax Credit that encourages our businesses and workers to develop cutting-edge ‚ÄúMade in America‚Äù products and services.  ‚Ä¢ Retaining the tax-preferred status of private-activity bonds that are used to finance valuable infrastructure projects.  ‚Ä¢    Eliminates the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, thereby lowering taxes and eliminating confusion and uncertainty so American job creators can focus on growing their business and hiring more workers, rather than on burdensome paperwork.  ‚Ä¢ Modernizes our international tax system so America‚Äôs global businesses will no longer be held back by an outdated ‚Äúworldwide‚Äù tax system that results in double taxation for many of our nation‚Äôs job creators.  ‚Ä¢    Makes it easier for American businesses to bring home foreign earnings to invest in growing jobs and paychecks in our local communities.  ‚Ä¢ Prevents American jobs, headquarters, and research from moving overseas by eliminating incentives that now reward companies for shifting jobs, profits, and manufacturing plants abroad.  For greater American energy security and economic growth, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:  ‚Ä¢ Establishes an environmentally responsible oil and gas program in the non-wilderness 1002 Area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Congress specifically set aside the 1.57-million acre 1002 Area for potential future development. Two lease sales will be held over the next decade and surface development will be limited to 2,000 federal acres ‚Äì just one ten-thousandth of all of ANWR.  ‚Ä¢ Significantly boosts American energy production. Responsible development in the 1002 Area will raise tens of billions of dollars for deficit reduction in the decades to come, while creating thousands of new jobs, reducing our  dependence on foreign oil, and helping to keep energy affordable for American families and businesses.  ‚Ä¢ Provides a temporary increase in offshore revenue sharing for the Gulf Coast in 2020 and 2021, allowing those states to invest in priorities such as coastal restoration and hurricane protection.","status",NA,NA,164,105,64,21,0,3,2,15

What that means is the Latino unemployment rate is a measly 4.7 percent. Black Unemployment Rate Hits 17-Year Low At 7.3 percent, the black unemployment rate still needs to improve, but not since hitting 7 percent in 2000 have things looked this good, most especially after nearly two decades of double-digit unemployment. Real Economic Growth After an unexpectedly high growth rate of 3.3 percent in the third quarter of 2017 (and that is with two devastating hurricanes), projections for the fourth quarter have edged into the magic number of 4 percent. Soaring Economic Optimism Optimism in the American economy breeds investor confidence and consumer spending, which, in turn, drives all the creation and manufacturing and shipping of products needed to fill those needs, which, in turn, gives us Boom Times. For the first time in more than a decade, a majority of Americans see our economy as ‚Äúgood or excellent.‚Äù A near record of 41 percent believe 2018 will see an even better economy and their home values rise; 42 percent believe their wages will increase. Perception is reality. Booming Stock Market With millions of working and middle-class Americans invested in the stock market through various retirement accounts, every announcement of a new record rings like a cash register ringing in their hardworking ears. While pushing long overdue corporate (and income) taxes through Congress, using whatever authority he can to unilaterally cut red tape, and the power of the bully pulpit to sell America and the American worker to the world, Trump‚Äôs tide is lifting all boats in ways the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù warned us was not possible. Unemployment Rate Hits 17-Year Low America now enjoys an unemployment rate of just 4.1 percent, the lowest since 2000. Manufacturing Jobs Boom In the final year of the Obama presidency, America lost a net of 16,000 manufacturing jobs. While still president and speaking of Trump, this is how President Obama responded: When somebody says like the person you just mentioned who I‚Äôm not going to advertise for, that he‚Äôs going to bring all these jobs back. Well how exactly are you going to do that? What are you going to do? There‚Äôs uh-uh no answer to it. He just says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to negotiate a better deal.‚Äù Well, how? How exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have? And usually the answer is, he doesn‚Äôt have an answer. So far in 2017, a full 171,000 manufacturing jobs have been created. Moreover, the manufacturing unemployment rate is just 2.6 percent, the lowest ever recorded. With massive tax cuts expected to become law this week, maybe even as early as Tuesday, this should make for a very bright 2018 and relieve fears of the stock market gains becoming a bubble. Additionally, these tax cuts also finally kill off the onerous Obamacare mandate, a massive tax increase that brutalizes those making less than $50,000 a year. Other goodies include incentives for corporations to repatriate trillions stashed overseas to avoid America‚Äôs unnecessarily high tax rates. Moreover, finally, after decades of being blocked for no good reason, this tax bill ends the dumb ban on oil drilling in Alaska‚Äôs Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), which will create any number of solid manufacturing jobs in an area in desperate of them. Hopefully, everything mentioned above will turn into the kind of job growth this country should have seen after coming out of 2008‚Äôs Great Recession (had Obama‚Äôs affection for socialism, wealth distribution, and central government control not smothered it). And a jobs boom could not come at a better time for the American worker. With unemployment at just 4.1 percent, something close to full employment, wage increases will surely follow.‚Äù","status",NA,NA,119,50,29,14,2,1,0,10

During my time in Congress, I have voted for disaster relief packages and I have voted against them. The difference between a yes or a no vote? I look at whether the spending is really going towards disaster relief, how are we paying for it, and the process for getting the bill to the floor.   The House just voted on another supplemental disaster appropriations bill for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and the California wildfires with the price tag of $81 billion ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt support it. The bill wasn‚Äôt paid for, was cobbled together at the last minute, and had been loaded down with extra pet projects. This happened with Superstorm Sandy several years ago too. I supported the first package, but couldn‚Äôt support the other packages since they contained projects unrelated to the disaster.   I am open to federal funding for disaster relief, but we have to do it the right way. I also believe that whenever possible these relief bills should be paid for with corresponding spending cuts. When we have emergencies come up in our personal lives, we are forced to make tough decisions and set priorities. The federal government should have to operate the same way. We're over $20 trillion in national debt, and we absolutely have to get handle on government spending.   Very recently, we've heard Democrats in Congress talk about their concern for our national debt in the context of the tax reform debate. Unfortunately, I have little reason to believe their concern on this issue is genuine. First off, the money being talked about in the tax reform debate belongs to the taxpayers, and returning as much money to them (to you) as possible is the moral thing to do. Secondly, as President Kennedy once said and as history has proven, tax reform that spurs economic growth results in more government revenue, thus helping pay for tax cuts in the first place. Finally, it's important to remember that we don't have a revenue problem in the United States Federal Government, we have a spending problem. Our debt is driven by our addiction to spending, and therefore the solution to that problem is not raising taxes on the public, but rather cutting spending, which is something that Democrats who believe in a large federal government strongly oppose. Over the last few days, you have undoubtedly heard media reports of a possible government shutdown. Well, those shutdown fears were almost exclusively the result of Democrats demanding increases in domestic non-defense government spending. Don't claim to suddenly care about an issue like our debt, when you have done absolutely nothing to address spending over the past nine years.  The bottom line is this: emergencies are unpredictable and there is no way to foresee the magnitude of devastation and damage they will cause. I want to help people on the ground in a responsible way, but I can‚Äôt support giveaway packages that lose focus on the goal ‚Äì people in need. I am always willing to consider disaster relief packages, but we must change the spending culture in Washington and address underlying issues that are driving our spending decisions. We have to change how we budget for disaster funding, and improve the process so we aren't scrambling to pass these massive spending packages at the last minute that further mortgage away our children's future.","status",NA,NA,98,60,11,12,1,0,0,3
