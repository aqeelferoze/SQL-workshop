Trump and the Republican Congress accomplished big things for the American people over the last 100 days. The highlights of the last 100 days include:  --Congress passed and the president signed 28 bills into law. That equals out to a bill being signed into law every three days.  --Of those, 13 were passed using a special process under the Congressional Review Act, known as CRAs. Before Donald Trump became president, only one CRA had ever become law.  --CRAs are used to stop harmful regulations put in place by the previous administration at the last minute. Here are a few of the Obama administration rules that were repealed: 1) A rule that barred Georgia and other states from defunding Planned Parenthood; 2) A rule that could have eliminated one-third of coal mining jobs;  3) And a rule that would have made it harder for some law-abiding seniors to exercise their Second Amendment rights.  --Between the CRAs and actions President Trump has taken on his own, taxpayers were already saved more than $86 billion in regulatory costs, according to the American Action Forum.  --President Trump nominated and the Senate confirmed a new Supreme Court Justice, Neil Gorsuch, who is a conservative replacement for Justice Scalia.  --Despite Senate Democrats doing everything possible to take down President Trump’s nominees, the Senate has still confirmed 25 nominees, including Secretary Tom Price and Secretary Sonny Perdue.   --President Trump has also kept his promise to step up the fight against the Islamic State and evil around the globe, including dropping the “Mother Of All Bombs” on Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan and launching 59 cruise missiles against Assad for his horrific war crimes.  --President Trump presented a plan to secure the border, including requesting proposals for construction of the border wall and hiring additional border patrol agents.  --President Trump requested an additional $30 billion to strengthen the military and secure the border.  --President Trump introduced a plan to cut taxes for all Americans and simplify the tax code.","status",NA,NA,103,54,23,6,18,0,0,5

Over the last seven years we kept fighting, we never gave up, and now we’re finally passing a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare that will hit the desk of a president who will sign it. This is Phase 1 of the President Trump’s three phase healthcare plan. Taken together, the president’s plan will reduce health insurance premiums, increase access to care and put patients first.  Importantly, the American Health Care Act continues to protect people with pre-existing conditions from price gouging, and they cannot be denied coverage. What’s new is that each state can take its own approach, as long as there are basic protections and clear benefits, such as increasing enrollment, offering more choices and lowering costs. A lot of work has gone into finding the right balance between lifting federal mandates and protecting Americans with serious health challenges, and I believe this is it.","link","http://tomgraves.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398761","tomgraves.house.gov",90,92,12,10,1,1,0,42

He’s keeping his campaign promises, and also being very honest with Americans about what it takes to balance the budget. Many decisions are hard, but the president has offered new ideas and a fresh approach to solve our nation’s greatest challenges.   The president’s vision includes major middle-income and business tax cuts, and a $1 trillion public-private plan for national infrastructure projects. These proposals would open up new opportunities and good jobs in communities across Georgia.  I support the proposal to build upon our spending cuts and further reduce the size of many federal agencies. The president rightly wants to have fewer bureaucrats around to regulate our lives in order to free up funding for border security and the military.   Congress has about four months to dig into the plan, debate the merits and respond with a final spending bill. I’m excited to work with the president and his team to do big things and empower Americans to achieve their dreams.","status",NA,NA,123,73,21,3,5,0,2,30

Our Wall Street reform bill turns the page on President Obama’s misguided financial takeover. It strikes the right balance between protecting Americans’ financial future and eliminating unnecessary regulations so that more of Georgia’s families, entrepreneurs and businesses can grow and thrive.   Importantly, our Wall Street reform bill also protects taxpayers. It ensures working families are never again asked to bail out any financial institution with their hard-earned tax dollars. It cuts the deficit by $24 billion and reforms the rogue Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and brings it under the regular government funding process. Currently, CFPB spends hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars every year without congressional approval.","link","https://tomgraves.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398780","tomgraves.house.gov",57,35,6,3,1,1,3,9

The first bill, the Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act, which the House passed on Tuesday, would simplify a complex web of state tax laws so employees are not subject to state income tax outside their home state unless they work in another state for more than 30 days during the calendar year.  In other words, if you live in Northwest Georgia but occasionally work in Tennessee, Alabama or any other state, this bill is for you. In today’s highly-mobile economy, no one should face extra taxes for the location of a few days of work. This bill means more money in your pocket.  The second bill, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which the House passed today, is bipartisan legislation strengthening and reauthorizing the Perkins Act, which provides funding for career and technical education.   As new technology continues to change the manufacturing industry and other skilled jobs, career and technical training is more important than ever. This bill will help educate, train or re-train Georgians for the cutting-edge jobs of today with an eye on the jobs of tomorrow.   That means more opportunities for individuals in Northwest Georgia to land good-paying jobs in textile mills, flooring plants, chemical manufacturing facilities, auto-parts factories and other workplaces.","status",NA,NA,29,11,6,0,0,0,0,0

The certainty the bill provides will empower individuals and companies use new defenses against cybercriminals. I also hope it spurs a new generation of tools and methods to level the lopsided cyber battlefield, if not give an edge to cyber defenders. We must continue working toward the day when it’s the norm – not the exception – for criminal hackers to be identified and prosecuted.

Trump and a Republican Congress is to cut taxes and help businesses create more American jobs. Our bill throws out the old system and creates a simpler, flatter and fairer tax code.  It will put more money in the pockets of hard-working Georgia families and make the annual tax filing process a lot easier. In fact, the House Ways and Means Committee predicts the typical family could file their taxes on a form the size of a postcard.    Additionally, the bill promotes economic growth and private-sector job creation by slashing the corporate tax rate – currently the highest in the developed world – and cutting tax rates for small business income to the lowest levels since World War II.   Our bill delivers relief for families and businesses, unleashes economic growth and private-sector job creation, and fulfills President Trump’s promise to the American people. I urge the Senate to act quickly so we can send a final tax reform bill to the president as soon as possible.","link","https://tomgraves.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398865","tomgraves.house.gov",163,117,35,27,2,3,3,45
