CLAY HIGGINS SUPPORTS CLARIFICATION OF THE JONES ACT   WASHINGTON DC - The US Customs and Border Protection Agency recently issued clarifications for Jones Act compliance. This action brings the Jones Act back into line with its original intentions. This action will incentivize the use of American crews and ships, particularly in the energy sector. Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA) supports these changes as they will help many of the maritime and oil and gas operations that the third congressional district relies on.    “The US Customs and Border Protections Agency’s (CBP) recent clarification of Jones Act compliance is a prime example of the work the 115th Congress will be undertaking in an effort to undo years of burdensome regulations that have caused our economy to shrink, jobs to be lost, and endangered the futures of many families around the nation,” said Rep. Clay Higgins. “The CBP ruling will bolster both Louisiana businesses and the oil and gas industry while at the same time promoting the nation’s energy independence. This is only the beginning of a renewed focus on the American worker and American economy, and I look forward to the positive impact this clarification will have on South Louisiana and the country,” said Higgins.   Employment opportunities across the third congressional district have been in decline due mainly to the recent decline in oil prices. Congressman Higgins believes this more traditional interpretation of the Jones Act will help alleviate this strain and promote economic growth and job creation.   ##","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanClayHiggins/photos/a.389585548056978.1073741828.388451608170372/400882130260653/?type=3",NA,102,10,63,7,0,0,0,0

CLAY HIGGINS NAMED TO ANTI-TERRORISM TASK FORCE  WASHINGTON DC - Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA) has been appointed to serve on a bi-partisan, eight member Homeland Security Committee Task Force focused on denying terrorists entry into the United States. With the terrorist threat on the rise and immigration a key concern for the 115th Congress, this Task Force will play an important role in closing gaps in our counterterrorism screening and vetting procedures.   “It’s an honor to be chosen by Chairman McCaul, as well as my esteemed colleagues on the House Committee on Homeland Security, to serve on this vital task force,” said Rep. Clay Higgins. “The threats to America are menacing and real. My real world Law Enforcement experience will enable me to bring a boots-on-the-ground perspective, as we search together for solutions to eliminate terrorist entry into the United States and keep America safe,” said Higgins.   The Task Force will examine all pathways by which extremists might infiltrate the homeland and will seek to resolve potential weaknesses in these systems. The panel will begin work in March and will provide a final report with its findings later this year.   ##","status",NA,NA,426,79,467,59,1,1,0,0

If there are opportunities for our farmers to trade with Cuba, then that’s something we’re definitely going to want to look at.”    A recent Pew public opinion poll showed increased, widespread support by Americans to end the Cuban trade embargo.   ##","status",NA,NA,39,10,6,0,0,1,0,0

CLAY HIGGINS INTRODUCES FIRST PIECE OF LEGISLATION  WASHINGTON D.C. – Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA) has introduced H.R. 1252 the “DHS Acquisition Authorities Act of 2017” as his first legislative initiative as a member of Congress. The bill is designed to create greater accountability for acquisitions programs within the Department of Homeland Security. A 2015 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that 20 out of the 22 major DHS acquisition programs experienced cost growth, schedule slips, or both. The “DHS Acquisition Authorities Act” will clearly designate who is responsible for each major acquisition program at DHS and requires documentation for each program that details life cycle cost estimates, cost-benefit analysis, and a detailed schedule for each project.    “As a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, it became apparent to my colleagues and I that our current major acquisition programs are unaffordable and inefficient,” said Rep. Clay Higgins. “We want to make sure all acquisition programs are being properly overseen and managed by appropriate staff at DHS. Ensuring proper oversight and clearly designated accountability is just common sense and good practice,” said Higgins.   The legislation defines major acquisition programs as a DHS project or facility that carries a $300 million or more life cycle cost estimate. Some examples of these programs, to name a few, include the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Passenger Screening Program, the National Cybersecurity Protection System, the Custom and Border Protection’s (CBP) Integrated Fixed Towers, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Logistics Supply Chain Management System.  The “DHS Acquisition Authorities Act” designates the Department of Homeland Security Under Secretary for Management as the Chief Acquisition Officer and gives the Under Secretary the authority to delegate each major acquisition program to specific senior officials. The bill also outlines new requirements for the DHS Chief Procurement Officer and the DHS Chief Information Officer designed to increase accountability and budget restraint.   “The federal government’s spending is off the rails. There’s no other way to put it,” said Rep. Higgins. “There is no reason why we cannot protect our homeland, secure the border and continue to rein in spending. That’s what Americans expect of us and we have to deliver.”  The DHS Acquisition Authorities Act of 2017 is scheduled to be marked up in the House Committee on Homeland Security on Wednesday March 08, 2017.   ##","status",NA,NA,104,12,18,11,0,0,0,0

He was a brilliant man and managed to incorporate life lessons in everything he did with me. Dad advised me, regarding billiards and life, that if I shoot a scared stick, I'll always lose.   The removal of longstanding monuments of American Veterans reflects weakness and fear. Our history is our history. Good or bad, uplifting or depressing, righteous or dark... our American history is ours, all of it, we've earned it. To hide or destroy selected historical monuments reflects a society unwilling or unable to accept the reality of our entire history. If we shoot a scared stick, we ultimately lose.   That being said, as a dedicated Constitutionalist, I completely support States rights and the right of municipalities and local governing authorities to conduct their business according to the dictates and will of their own citizenry within the parameters of their own laws and civil procedures. Healthy, meaningful debate should be engaged and encouraged at the local and State level regarding any controversial act of the governing authority.   America is replete with Patriot fervor. It is always my prayer, that my fellow Americans will engage. Only through candid, thoughtful discussion, can we evolve as a Nation reflective of our Saviors intent.

EDWARDS URGING STATE TO BLOCK THE REVISION OF OUR HISTORY  WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Clay Higgins, R-LA, sent a letter to Governor John Bel Edwards today, calling on the State of Louisiana to support measures blocking the removal of several historical monuments in New Orleans.  The letter reads, “The current spectacle in New Orleans reflects a culture of growing weakness and fear. Our history is our history. Good or bad, uplifting or depressing, righteous or dark…our American history is ours, all of it, and we’ve earned it. Hiding or destroying longstanding monuments of American veterans is a mistake with serious consequences and a denial of the reality of our entire history.”  Congressman Higgins notes that this decision is ultimately in the hands of the state and the City of New Orleans, and he strongly urges the Governor to take action to preserve the monuments.  “Our state is facing serious challenges. We should be focused on the real issues at hand, instead of getting stuck on needless distractions,” said Rep. Higgins.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanClayHiggins/photos/a.389585548056978.1073741828.388451608170372/444394529242746/?type=3",NA,659,149,707,99,2,4,1,13

Harvey will weaken to a tropical storm by Sunday, before moving back offshore and heading towards the upper Texas or southwest Louisiana coastline next week. It's too early to say how strong the storm could be for a second landfall next week. Long duration of heavy rain and flooding will be possible across our region Sunday into next week.   Storm surge is expected one to three feet above ground level for coastal areas. Winds could gust in the 25-35 mph range along coastal sections of Louisiana late Friday into Saturday morning. The tornado threat is very small for the weekend.

It will slowly head towards the upper Texas coast, before making landfall Wednesday morning as a tropical storm.  The major storyline with this system will continue to be the heavy rain and dangerous flood threat, especially in southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana. Storm total values could approach the 30 to 40 inch range in parts of southeast Texas.  This system is not expected to strengthen significantly, wind-wise. However due to the track forecast, a tropical storm warning is in effect for Jefferson County and Cameron and Vermilion Parishes. Expect to see wind gusts in the 30 to 40 mph range near the coast in the warning area.  Storm Surge will be one to three feet AGL. During the period of high tides tonight and Tuesday, expect to see coastal flooding in Jefferson County, and Cameron, Vermilion, Iberia, and St. Mary Parishes.  We are forecasting another 8 to 15 inches of rain in southeast Texas, 6 to 10 inches in southwest Louisiana, 5 to 8 inches in south central Louisiana, and 4 to 8 inches in central Louisiana. Note: There is potential for higher rain totals in southwest and/or south central Louisiana, depending on where the rain bands develop.  There will be a threat for isolated tornadoes tonight and tomorrow.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CalcasieuOHSEP/photos/a.467150449968612.129581.462720550411602/1965824650101177/?type=3",NA,11,0,0,0,0,0,3,0

However, this cornerstone upon...which we will build...does indeed reflect a fairer, simpler tax code that strengthens our economy, creates job growth, and allows individual Americans, as well as all American businesses, to keep more of what they’ve earned.  I strongly support significant reform of our tax code so that everyday American families and small businesses can take charge of their finances and spend, save, or invest however they see fit.
