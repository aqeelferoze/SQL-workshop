I helped start Lily’s Place with dedicated nurses, doctors and community leaders to be part of the solution to the opioid crisis ravaging West Virginia.  Lily’s Place focuses solely on helping newborn babies whose tiny bodies have been ravaged by the effects of drug withdrawal. Lily’s Place is a model of care highlighted in legislation I introduced that was signed into law last year and shows how a community can band together to help the most innocent victims of this epidemic.  To accuse Lily’s Place of contributing to the drug crisis demonstrates a willful ignorance of the true causes of the opioid epidemic.","link","http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/20170809/amid-opioid-crisis-drug-firm-cites-wv-infant-rehab-clinic-for-possible-fault","wvgazettemail.com",78,16,14,3,0,11,4,23
