In Texas alone, more than 150 banks have disappeared in the past five years as a result of these costs and government intervention.","link","http://williams.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-williams-statement-on-trump-dodd-frank-review","illiams.house.gov",111,61,11,4,2,2,0,19

I understand, firsthand, the impact that unfair, job killing taxes and regulations have on Main Street. I know what it’s like to nearly lose a family business that was built from the ground up, just because the federal government believes in a death tax. This, my friends, is a tax that strips families of the American dream they worked so hard to achieve. The inheritance tax takes money from folks who know how to use it to create jobs and donate to charities and puts it in the hands of those responsible for a 20 trillion dollar national debt. Mr. Speaker, I came up here to speak on behalf of the job creators that employ more than half of America’s workforce. These are the men and women who suffer directly from politicians’ knee-jerk reactions – politicians who have never met a payroll and have never worked in the private sector.

The irony that hardworking families have to pay money to figure out how much money to pay Uncle Sam goes without humor. For three decades, lawmakers have called for reform of the tax code while taking no true action. In that time we’ve seen loopholes and deductions created on behalf of special interests, but at the expense of Main Street America. As this Congress and administration look to tackle tax reform in the coming months, I hope and pray Washington starts to work for the families who cannot afford to contribute money to politicians or send lobbyists to DC.

We saw this when Republicans took back the House, took back the Senate, and then, most recently, recaptured the White House. The only time Nancy Pelosi told the truth was when she said, “We have to pass Obamacare so that we can find out what is in it.” Today, one-third of America’s counties have only one insurer left on the Obamacare exchanges. Premiums and out-of-pocket costs have increased and choices have become non-existent. Simply put, the marketplaces are not marketplaces, they are monopolies. Time and again, Texas and the 25th congressional district have rejected the Washington style big government and socialist policies of Nancy Pelosi. She is responsible for the largest tax increase in American history, and I hope she takes some Texas values back to Washington and stops holding on to failed, broken policies at the expense of the American people.","status",NA,NA,114,198,14,5,14,0,1,57

Looking back, I believe President Donald J. Trump has many accomplishments that conservatives can be proud of:   - Neil Gorsuch achieved a successful nomination on April 7, 2017 as an appropriate replacement for conservative Justice Scalia;  - 13 CRAs (Congressional Review Act) have been passed under the president. CRAs allow Congress to reverse rules within 60 legislative days of their submission. This means republicans have been able to roll back many of the Obama regulations that have suppressed our economy;  - And, the beginnings of the largest and most successful tax cut and reform in American history.    The first 100 days for the Trump administration have come and gone very quickly. However, in this short amount of time, the president has made more strides for a #betterway than Obama did in his entire eight years. I look forward to working with  my Republican colleagues to help President Trump Make America Great Again!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepRogerWilliams/photos/a.354104151362980.1073741825.322383274535068/1135527189887335/?type=3",NA,45,84,5,4,18,1,1,29

Since its inception, premiums have skyrocketed while deductibles and other out of pocket costs have made having insurance pointless. Insurers are leaving the marketplaces, thereby limiting choices and stifling competition. This is what happens when government takes power away from the people. The American Health Care Act will begin to undo the damage that has been caused by Obamacare. It will restore competition, bring down costs and increase options. All the while, it will protect our nation’s most vulnerable.

We came together as a nation and my hope is that we will continue to move forward and grow stronger together.    I’d also like to give you an update on Team Williams. Zack Barth from my office is doing exceptionally well. Our entire baseball family enjoyed having him in the dugout last night. It has been humbling and inspiring to watch Zack interact with friends, family and the media these past few days. He has shown true bravery that surpasses anything I could have imagined and I could not be more proud to have him in my office and working for our district.   Thank you again to officers David Bailey and Crystal Griner. Without these two brave heroes, I cannot begin to imagine what could have been. Capitol Police as well as the Alexandria Police Department stepped up in a moment of crisis and I will never be able to express my endless appreciation to them and any other first responders involved.   Lastly, we’d like to thank everyone for the overwhelming amount of love and support they’ve sent our way. The people of Texas’ 25th district as well as around the nation have been extremely kind and generous and we cannot put into words how appreciative we are.

Please share to help our fellow Texans who may be affected by the storm -   FEMA recommends visitors and residents in areas potentially affected by Hurricane Harvey take the following actions:  If the storm is expected to affect your area, know your evacuation zone and follow the direction of state, local or tribal officials if an evacuation is ordered for your area. Storm surge poses a significant threat for drowning and can sometimes cut off evacuation routes, so do not delay leaving if an evacuation is ordered for your area.  Monitor local radio or TV stations for updated emergency information, and follow the instructions of state, local, and tribal officials.  There is the potential for flooding and storm surge with Hurricane Harvey. Driving through a flooded area can be extremely hazardous. Nearly half of all flash flood deaths happen in vehicles. Stay safe when in your car by watching for flooding in low lying areas, at bridges and highway dips. As little as six inches of water may cause you to lose control of your vehicle. If you encounter floodwaters, remember – turn around, don’t drown.  Download the FEMA mobile app, which provides a customizable checklist of emergency supplies, directions to open shelters and recovery centers, disaster survival tips, and weather alerts from the National Weather Service. The app also enables users to receive push notifications reminding them to take important steps to prepare their homes and families for disasters.  Businesses of all sizes should prepare in advance for the approaching storm to prevent loss of life, property, or disruption to operations. Businesses can review and update their business continuity plans and ensure their workforce knows what to do before and during the storm. Resources are available on web sites such as Ready.gov/business and the SBA.gov/disaster-planning.  Visit www.ready.gov or www.listo.gov to learn more about preparing for hurricanes and severe weather.","status",NA,NA,17,3,6,0,0,0,0,0

The focus needs to be on relief for the lower/middle class & creating economic opportunity  Corporate Tax Rate:  Needs to be lowered to 20% to encourage economic growth & create good-paying jobs. The US is a model for creating a competitive free market system – free of a tax code that discourages growth  Alternative Minimum Tax:  We must repeal the AMT. This makes our tax code even more complicated  Inheritance Tax:  The federal government should not punish those who pass their family business or life savings onto loved ones  Full & Immediate Expensing:  Capital investment encourages economic growth & creates more jobs with higher wages  #JumpstartAmerica is smart and bold and offers an authentic business perspective, which is exactly what this economy needs.","status",NA,NA,68,48,8,4,1,0,1,10
