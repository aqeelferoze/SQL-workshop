Liliana, mother of two young children, has lived in the United States for 11 years, under Republican and Democratic administrations.  She lived here to watch an immigration reform proposal that would have given her a path to citizenship pass the U.S. Senate. The bill could have passed the House and become law, but Republican leadership never gave it a vote.  The remarkable turn of events in our nation now will deport Liliana to her native El Salvador, despite a pardon by her governor for a broken tail light infraction, and advocacy by both of her U.S. Senators. It will also deprive two young children of their mother.   The decision to deport Liliana Cruz Mendez lays bare the injustice of heartless Trump’s immigration stance, and its lie about making communities safer.

This has long been a serious problem, and Congress should take a leading role and help usher in change to protect victims and change our culture for the better.  Those who commit these offenses must be held accountable, no matter how powerful they are.  Congress should not be exempt, and I believe that Congressman John Conyers should resign.  Every victim of sexual assault should feel safe coming forward and have an avenue for redress. We must have systems focused on protecting victims and preventing assault.  I voted for a bill yesterday which would mandate sexual harassment training in Congress, but that is an insufficient response.  Congress must pass Congresswoman Jackie Speier's Me Too Act, which would reform policies in Congress to improve the process for complaints, add transparency, give victims access to counsel without forcing them to be silenced, and require lawmakers rather than taxpayers to pay damages.  We need more women in positions of leadership in communities, businesses, and government.   I've been working on that since I got to Congress, and I will continue those efforts. Virginia's elevation of women in elected leadership this month is a good sign.","status",NA,NA,130,12,2,5,0,0,0,0

Simultaneously, they refuse to address other urgent priorities, including protections for Dreamers, reauthorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), bipartisan legislation to address rising healthcare premiums, and the passage of relief funding to help areas affected by natural disasters. Instead of working to pass bills which have the support of members of both parties and the President, Republican leaders chose to spend the past few months pushing deeply unpopular tax cuts for the wealthy.   The Continuing Resolution on the floor today would postpone action on addressing these problems which cannot wait, and therefore I cannot support this bill.  This is not an easy vote, as I am well aware of the impact which any gap in funding the government would have on the many federal employees in Northern Virginia. I have prepared, with my colleague Rep. Wittman, legislation that would ensure that furloughed federal workers receive back pay in the event of a government shutdown. But the effects of postponing action to protect Dreamers and fund CHIP could be devastating and irreversible for many of my constituents, and I cannot in good conscience vote to leave them behind.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/congress-set-to-delay-shutdown-setting-up-bigger-spending-fight-later/2017/12/07/6b6712fa-db51-11e7-b1a8-62589434a581_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_shutdown-245p%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.8c573f46d47a","washingtonpost.com",59,17,5,0,0,1,2,39
