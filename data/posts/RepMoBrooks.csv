Luther Strange did it as Alabama Attorney General. Recusals are quite common among prosecutors. As such, I am proud that Attorney General Jeff Sessions did the right thing by recusing himself just in case there is ever sufficient evidence to warrant an investigation of the Trump Campaign for President.  Apparently recusal is not enough for some hyper-partisan Democrats. To those Democrats I say this: Get over it. Your side lost the election. Your conduct embarrasses yourself and your country. America needs you to stop whining and act in a bipartisan manner for the good of our country to help overcome America’s border security, health care, debt and other challenges.

While today’s health care legislation falls short of the full ObamaCare repeal that I called for and believe in, a partial repeal does more good for working American families than no repeal at all. Leaving ObamaCare in place is not an option for Americans.

Our immigration system, which is by far the most generous system on the planet, favors low-skilled immigrants, thereby depressing wages and harming our most vulnerable citizens.    The RAISE Act replaces the current permanent employment-visa framework with a skills-based system that rewards applicants based on their individual merits. Further, the legislation eliminates the diversity visa lottery as well as the immigration preferences for extended family and adult family members of U.S. residents, also known as ""chain migration"".   America must recognize our challenges and opportunities, and be much more selective in our immigration policies to ensure incoming immigrants are both self-sufficient and are able and willing to be properly absorbed into American society.
