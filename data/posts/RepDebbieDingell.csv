Debbie Dingell","2017-01-03","2017-01-03 17:42:07","It is a great day for manufacturing in Michigan and the United States with Ford Motor Company's announcement that its highest-tech vehicles will continue to be built right here in the U.S. Our challenge now is to continue to do everything we can – together – to keep Michigan at the forefront of innovation and technology and keep manufacturing in the United States.   Today’s announcement demonstrates what can happen when we do work together at the federal, state and local levels with workers and manufacturers to keep jobs in the U.S. This announcement also shows that the American auto industry continues to lead the way in many areas that will define the future of mobility, including autonomous vehicles and electric vehicles. Michigan’s auto workers are the best in the world, and Ford’s investment in the Flat Rock Assembly Plant that will create 700 new jobs illustrates their confidence in the U.S. workforce. This is a great way to start the New Year.","link","https://debbiedingell.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/dingell-applauds-ford-s-announcement-build-autonomous-commercial","debbiedingell.house.gov",232,16,26,12,0,0,0,0

For too long, trade agreements like NAFTA have failed to level the playing field for American workers, reducing wages and costing hardworking families in Michigan and across the country the opportunity to earn a decent living.   What I hope now is that President-elect Trump will make this issue a priority in his first 100 days and work with Congress on a new approach to trade that will create jobs, grow wages and put American workers first. It is important to note that Canada and Mexico have agreed that NAFTA needs to be revisited and modernized. This should be done on a bipartisan basis and we are here and ready to get to work. #FixNAFTA","link","https://debbiedingell.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/dingell-calls-president-elect-trump-live-promise-renegotiate-nafta","debbiedingell.house.gov",67,11,6,2,0,2,1,0

While Japan is an important ally, these unfair trade practices have had enormous, devastating impacts on American manufacturing for decades and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.

ICE also has an equally important responsibility to be transparent in its operations and to clearly communicate with local communities and law enforcement about their policies and activities.

James is right that our trade policies need to change, and we now have a real opportunity to renegotiate NAFTA in a way that puts working families first. My colleagues and I have introduced a blueprint to do just that and I'm proud to work with the Teamsters to move it forward.","link","http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/2017/03/01/trade-deal/98543984/","detroitnews.com",43,7,3,4,0,0,0,0

If a power line falls on your vehicle, remain inside until help arrives. -Always operate generators outdoors to avoid dangerous buildup of toxic fumes. -Turn off or unplug all appliances to prevent an electrical overload when power is restored. Leave one light switch on to indicate when power is restored. -Don’t open refrigerators or freezers more than absolutely necessary. A closed refrigerator will stay cold for 12 hours.

Ford’s announcement of a new advanced data center at the Flat Rock Assembly Plant also further positions the company as a leader in the future of mobility, including the development of connected and automated vehicles which have the potential to improve safety and save lives.

The committee was able to hear the empowering story of Tammi Carr and her family. The Carrs, and most importantly, their son and brother Chad, have inspired Michigan and the entire country with their strength and courage in the face of an unspeakable tragedy. Chad lost his battle with a rare form of pediatric brain cancer called DIPG on November 23, 2015, but along the way he showed all of us what it means to be #ChadTough.   Tammi and her family embody his same toughness and determination and are working to turn a tragedy into a positive – not only for their family, but for all children who suffer from rare diseases. As Tammi testified today, it is critical that we invest in medical research funding to prevent other families from going through what her family went through. She said, “if NIH funding is reduced, it will stifle progress for some of the most vulnerable people in our country who face devastating diseases like DIPG... That is not a future we can accept; for these children, it is no future at all. Our children deserve more. We must do better.”  We all must fight alongside Tammi and so many others to increase funding for the NIH, not decrease it, so we can provide hope to patients and ultimately find cures. As Tammi said, we must do better.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDebbieDingell/photos/a.642145099223701.1073741828.639796166125261/1122153754556164/?type=3",NA,108,5,4,8,0,0,1,0

He pointed out that until a few years ago, if you were born with a heart disease like Billy there was a good chance you would never be able to get health insurance, because you had a pre-existing condition – and if your parents didn’t have insurance you may not even live long enough to get denied.   Kimmel stated ""If your baby is going to die and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make. I think that’s something that whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right?”  As I keep saying, this is not about politics between two parties – it is about real people and the challenges they face every single day.

It restores access to year-round Pell grants, rejects proposed cuts to the #GreatLakes Restoration Initiative and increases funding for vital medical research by $2 billion. Particularly reassuring was the rejection of proposed cuts to the GLRI, which is critical for cleaning up toxic pollution, protecting our waters from invasive species like Asian carp, and restoring wildlife habitats. Protecting this funding is critical for the Great Lakes economy and our way of life. This legislation is a momentary victory, but our work is far from done.   Most disturbing were threats of a government shutdown in September. We will do everything we can over the next several months to ensure the programs funded today that matter to the working men and women of Michigan’s 12th District are funded in the next fiscal year and beyond.","link","https://debbiedingell.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/dingell-statement-passage-omnibus-funding-bill","debbiedingell.house.gov",116,13,10,1,0,0,2,2

This is a victory for the community, but especially for our kids, who have come to love “Dr. E” and are motivated to reach higher and work even harder because of his support and encouragement.

Before Dr. E came along, I never knew of the superintendents.” That hands-on approach is so important for our kids. Dr. Edmondson truly leads by example – helping to steer our kids on the pathway to success and working to ensure they have every opportunity to do what they want in life.   Another thing that Jeremiah said struck me – “Not often do I see leaders in my school that look like me.

While we need to see the details of Ford’s plan, it is a strong reminder of the responsibility of Congress to help create a business climate that ensures we are keeping jobs here in the U.S., supporting a strong manufacturing base, and as a result, a healthy auto industry. We need to be focused on policies not politics, and the uncertainty coming out of Washington these days is not creating economic stability or inspiring consumer confidence. In fact, it is doing the opposite. We need to be working together to accelerate our efforts to address barriers facing manufacturers and ensure our companies and workers can compete in the global marketplace. We need trade policies that protect against currency manipulation and ensure a level playing field. We need tax policies that ensure companies have access to the capital they need to keep the U.S. at the forefront of innovation and technology. The auto industry is still the backbone of the American economy, and we need to ensure that we can protect and grow the jobs in this industry, while at the same time ensuring companies can invest in growth and take advantage of emerging opportunities to remain competitive.  The bottom line is: this is about jobs. It’s about our families, friends and neighbors. We need to do everything we can to keep manufacturing in this country, and I will work with anyone to advance policies that protect and grow jobs and keep our economy strong.

Since NAFTA passed, too many workers in Michigan and across the country have seen their jobs shipped overseas, their wages drop in real terms and their families lose hope. We now have an opportunity to renegotiate this failed trade agreement, but it is critical that we do so in a way that puts working families first. We need to ensure that any renegotiated agreement creates jobs, raises wages and brings manufacturing back to this country. It must require strong rules of origin for cars and auto parts, which is critical for Michigan’s economy and the domestic auto industry, and the process must be open and transparent.   We cannot have another trade deal negotiated in secret. Today’s notice is very vague and it is not clear what the negotiation process will look like. If special interests dictate how NAFTA is renegotiated, the new deal could become more damaging for working families. We need to ensure that detailed negotiating goals are issued and that draft text is available after each negotiating round so the American people can determine how the policies will impact their families.

Eisenhower famously told troops on D-Day: “The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you.” His words still ring true today as we honor the brave servicemembers who fought and died to defend the democratic values we hold dear.

The #GreatLakes account for 20 percent of the world’s freshwater supply and are absolutely critical for millions of Americans who rely on them for clean drinking water, jobs and their way of life. Any spill in this area would be catastrophic for the entire region, and no barrier or wall would be able to contain it. As I told Prime Minister Trudeau last year, we never want to see nuclear waste in the Great Lakes.

They may try to jam a health care vote through both the Senate and the House, and everyone needs to make their voices heard loud and clear about what you are worried about and how this will impact you and your families.   It was a good weekend with important discussions, events, festivals and celebrations. Some very special moments. Last night, we went to the Because of the Brave dinner to support Downriver for Veterans. More than 100 veterans were at the dinner, including 12 who served in World War II. The hall was at capacity. Ann Rudisill, an Air Force veteran herself, recognized there were too many veterans Downriver with needs and few resources and realized we needed to do something. After serving Thanksgiving dinner to some who had no place to go, she opened a warehouse in Wyandotte that provides furniture, clothing, food, wheelchairs etc., and volunteers to help find housing, take veterans to the doctor or provide other things people need. I have attended many veteran events that have mattered, but this dinner was one of the most special as people just came together to thank the men and women who served and remind ourselves of the moral obligation we have to those who have sacrificed to keep us free.  This weekend also brought the Taylor Summer Festival 2017,  Trenton Summer Festival, Wayne County Senior Picnic, Ann Arbor Police and Fire Department Open House, Jim Toy Summer Festival, UAW party celebrating Joe Goddard’s retirement, graduations, farmers markets and many other events.   Everywhere I went, people are worried about health care. The proposal Senate Republicans released last week has many very frightened. I agree with President Trump on one thing on health care - the House bill was mean and from my perspective, the Senate bill could be even meaner. It undermines protections for those with pre-existing conditions and would have a devastating impact on working families with tens of millions of Americans losing coverage, and millions more paying more for less care. This legislation literally means life or death for people in Michigan and across the country. I will do everything possible to defeat this bill that will hurt millions of Americans.

The Fourth of July is an opportunity to pause and remember how lucky we are to be Americans. We remember that 241 years ago our founding fathers charted a path forward for this nation, and declared that all are created equal and ‘endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.’   Independence Day is a celebration of these values. It is also a time to honor the brave men and women who have served to protect and defend these rights so we may live safe, secure and free. As we gather in our communities for fireworks, barbecues and parades, let us stop to reflect and remember what we owe those who have fought for these principles throughout the history of our country.   We need to also remember there is far more that unites us than divides us, and we are stronger when we all may pursue our founders’ vision of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Let's use America’s birthday to remember what binds us together – to tone down our rhetoric and improve civility. Let us listen more, respect each other's opinions, disagree without disrespect, seek common ground as a starting point for dialogue about differences, be aware of preconceptions, and try to get others to do the same. Let us stand up to fear and hate; and encourage civic engagement as the antidote for current times.   Let us remember, first and foremost, that we are all Americans.

At some point, nearly everyone will need to take time off work to care for a new baby, recover from an illness, or care for a sick or aging family member, but today, 41 million people – 36 percent of the workforce – do not have a single paid sick day, and only 14 percent have access to paid leave through their employer.   For a majority of Americans, taking time off often means choosing between a paycheck and taking care of themselves or their family. No one should have to make that choice, and my colleagues and I are working to pass The Healthy Families Act and The FAMILY Act so they don't have to. These policies would provide paid time off for individuals to recover from an illness or welcome a new child.

No one should feel isolated, confused or shutout from the world because they cannot afford the treatment they need.","link","https://debbiedingell.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/dingell-introduces-legislation-allow-medicare-cover-hearing-aids","debbiedingell.house.gov",635,72,93,95,0,0,0,0

In Michigan, home of the modern labor movement, we know the hard-fought victories labor won for all of us – better wages, safer working conditions, a 40-hour work week, health care and retirement benefits, safe nurse to patient ratios and classrooms that aren’t overcrowded. The battles fought and won by labor improved the well-being and standard of living not just for their members, but for all who labor. We must never take these gains for granted.   At a time when unions are undermined and under attack, we must stand in solidarity with working men and women across this country. We need to fight for policies that keep good-paying jobs in this country, grow manufacturing and level the playing field on trade; we need policies that raise wages, address income inequality and ensure that the pensions working men and women have paid into their entire working lives are protected. We will never stop working toward these goals.   Today, I march side by side with my brothers and sisters in downtown Detroit, as I have for decades.

Automated vehicles have the potential to transform mobility in this country – reducing congestion on our roads, providing greater independence to seniors and those with disabilities, and helping to prevent the 35,000 deaths on our roadways each year. This is also fundamentally an issue of American competitiveness. Automated vehicles are going to be developed whether we like it or not. The question is whether the United States will remain in the driver’s seat as opposed to China, Japan, or even the EU who are all making significant investments in this space. The SELF DRIVE Act steers us in the right direction, and I want to thank the bipartisan leadership of the Energy and Commerce Committee for their hard work and support to get this legislation across the finish line.  This issue is so important for Michigan. Our state is synonymous with the development of the automobile; we transformed transportation and mobility with great inventors like Henry Ford, the Chryslers, Buick, and the Fisher brothers who all had a vision to make people's lives better. This isn't just about moving people from point A to point B, it is about human progress – the freedom of mobility to help make people's lives better and change the way the world moves. Michigan and the U.S. have always been at the forefront of this effort, and the SELF DRIVE Act will help ensure we can continue to innovate and lead for decades to come.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepDebbieDingell/videos/1280677538703784/",NA,173,10,17,7,1,4,0,0

September is Suicide Prevention Month, and with it comes the question of how we as a community can help end the stigma associated with mental health and bring conversations about suicide out of the darkness once and for all. The campus lost one of their own in the last week. Far too many families have suffered the heartbreak of suicide. With this year’s Suicide Prevention Month theme, “Take a Minute, Change a Life,” we are reminded of the actions that each of us can can take, however small, to educate others, touch someone and support our family, friends and community. While difficult to speak about, it is the reason I share my own family's story to help remove the stigma of talking about it.  I was also with veterans today and we need to remember our veterans are disproportionately impacted by suicide. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has enacted the #BeThere program to help combat this statistic and support veterans and servicemembers.  Small actions, like checking in on a neighbor or even a friendly smile can mean more than you know and help make someone feel less alone. We must continue to talk about these difficult issues, raise awareness and provide support. I told everyone today hug someone every day that just looks like they need someone to show they care. It is my hope that in doing so, we can help one another heal and reclaim hope.

Most people had no idea that Equifax was even holding their data. It’s one thing to take steps to mitigate damages after a breach has occurred, but going forward we must give consumers the chance to protect themselves before a breach happens. We need a longer debate about who owns this data and how we educate the American people.  We also need action, which is why I introduced the Data Protection Act of 2017 to require companies to better secure consumers’ sensitive personal information against a potential security breach. I am also a cosponsor of the Secure and Protect Americans’ Data Act, introduced by Energy and Commerce Ranking Member Frank Pallone and Rep. Schakowsky.

Tonight, the House Energy and Commerce Committee considered Republican proposals that would reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and community health centers by slashing billions from Medicare and the Affordable Care Act. CHIP is a lifeline for nearly nine million American children, ensuring that every child can go to the doctor when they need to and have necessary check-ups, immunizations and medical treatment. Community health centers fill the gaps in our system and are the main point of care for many Americans who have nowhere else to turn. These critical programs have been bipartisan from day one and should continue to be just that.  We have a responsibility to provide care for all Americans – young, old, sick, healthy, rich and poor. It is part of our fabric as a nation. We should not be robbing Peter to pay Paul, or in this case, dealing a devastating blow to the Affordable Care Act, Medicare and the seniors who depend on it in order to pay for equally important priorities.  I won't take a back seat to anybody in terms of fighting for children and working families. In Michigan, we have 82,000 kids on CHIP and another 1.2 million on Medicaid. If we don't act soon, Michigan will soon start to send notices to families that their child's coverage could be cancelled.  Imagine being single, working mother who is working two jobs to make ends meet, coming home after a very long day of work to find a letter saying your child may not have health insurance in a few weeks. You think about cutting back on groceries, keeping the house even colder, doing without medicine for yourself. This could be a reality for families in our state.  What we considered today doesn't work and is simply unacceptable. The authorization for these programs has already expired and we must act now, which is why it is so disappointing that this Republican proposal forces a false choice between kids and seniors. We should not undermine Medicare to pay for CHIP. Similarly, we should not raid $10 billion from the Affordable Care Act, including from the Prevention and Public Health Fund which provided critical aid in response to the Flint water crisis, to reauthorize our vital community health centers.   We should take a deep breath and move forward with consensus legislation that reauthorizes CHIP and community health centers rather than the dangerous and misguided proposals put forward today that put our children, families and seniors at risk.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDebbieDingell/photos/a.644559945648883.1073741829.639796166125261/1303417329763138/?type=3",NA,75,20,47,0,0,3,21,43

I also live with a man who suffers from chronic pain and needs access to opioids to manage it. We cannot let the pendulum swing too far in either direction. We must take real, serious steps to stop the number of overdoses in our country while still ensuring patients can access the medicine they need.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepDebbieDingell/videos/1321200401318164/",NA,162,50,28,18,1,7,2,0

The Republican budget resolution that passed the House today fails this test. It proposes to slash $1 trillion from Medicaid, which provides critical long-term care for seniors, and nearly $500 billion from Medicare, ending the program as we know it at a time when 10,000 seniors turn 65 every day. This proposal would also slash investments in education, job-training and infrastructure programs, which create jobs and help working families compete and succeed, and increase the deficit by more than $1 trillion – all to pave the way for a tax reform plan that provides a massive tax break to the wealthy and big corporations instead of the working families who need it most.   This is not responsible budgeting or responsible governing. Democrats fully support tax reform that helps working families succeed, promotes economic growth and makes the tax code simpler and fairer. We are ready and willing to work with Republicans toward that goal, but we cannot support a budget that cuts taxes for the wealthy on the backs of hardworking Americans, seniors and children.","link","https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/26/16526458/2018-senate-budget-explained","vox.com",88,47,123,2,0,5,39,127

Hardworking men and women in my district and across the country were made a promise when they started working – that they would get to retire with a pension that allows them to live with dignity and security.   Now, the pensions they’ve earned over a lifetime of hard work are under attack and in jeopardy of being cut by as much as 70 percent. We cannot allow this to happen. The Butch Lewis Act ensures workers and retirees can keep the retirement they have earned, and must be passed by Congress immediately.

Instead, the legislation that passed the House today leaves working Americans behind – increasing taxes for 86 million families and jeopardizing the future of Medicare and Social Security, all while providing trillions in tax breaks to the wealthy and big corporations. This is plain wrong.   Republicans are trying to sell working families a bag of goods, but the American people will not be fooled. Those Representatives who voted today to put politics above the people they represent will have to answer to hardworking families across the country who will see their taxes go up as a result of this devastating plan. Working families deserve better, and now more than ever, we must continue to fight alongside them.","link","https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/19/16790100/republican-tax-vote-2017-house","vox.com",67,64,28,1,1,0,27,96

That threat just became more real with today’s announcement that Michigan’s #CHIP allotment will expire in April 2018 and cancellation notices will start going out in the New Year to 100,000 Michigan families.   It is unconscionable that Congress would add $2.3 trillion to the deficit in order to pass tax breaks for the wealthiest and big corporations while leaving children and families out in the cold. CHIP ensures every child can go to the doctor when they need to and receive necessary checkups and immunizations. It has always been bipartisan, and there is no reason it should not be today. This is not a time for games; this is about real people’s lives. I am calling on Republican leadership to come together with Democrats to renew CHIP in a bipartisan way before we go home for Christmas. American families cannot wait any longer.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDebbieDingell/photos/a.642145099223701.1073741828.639796166125261/1377794988992038/?type=3",NA,55,27,59,0,1,2,28,55

It does nothing to provide certainty to businesses or families, and it does nothing to address urgent, overdue priorities for the American people. This bill fails to provide long-term funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which is a lifeline for 100,000 Michigan children; it fails to address DACA and bring needed relief to the 800,000 young people who call this country home; and it fails to include a common-sense fix to put our nation’s pension plans back on solid footing so American workers can keep the retirement they have earned.    This short-term bill is a disappointing yet unsurprising way to end the year given that Republicans have spent the majority of 2017 working to rip health care away from the American people and push through a partisan tax bill that provides tax cuts to the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. Democrats remain committed to fighting for the priorities that matter to families and communities.

This legislation dedicates existing revenue from oil and gas royalties to the Wildlife Conservation Restoration Program, which would provide states with new critically needed resources to effectively implement State Wildlife Action Plans to conserve 12,000 species in greatest need of conservation while providing the public with more access to open spaces.  I'm proud to partner with Rep. Fortenberry and the National Wildlife Federation, Bass Pro Shops, the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation and many others on this important legislation.
