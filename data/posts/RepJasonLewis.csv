The $20 trillion national debt poses a huge danger to their ability to succeed. The nation’s fiscal health should concern us all- and that’s why I opposed the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act today.   It’s important that we keep our government running, and I was pleased to see some of my priorities were properly funded. However it’s even more important that we fund our government responsibly. Washington bureaucrats are addicted to spending- and tackling the growing debt starts by not throwing millions at pet projects like Southwest Light Rail.   My vote today was to put Washington on notice: we need to get serious about tackling our debt and spending problems right now. I’m committed to working in the Budget Committee to make those tough decisions- because the future depends on it.","status",NA,NA,173,217,17,15,3,0,0,52

D Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which is the primary federal law supporting state and local Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs. Lewis is a cosponsor of this legislation. The Perkins Act makes grants to states to expand access to CTE and give students hands-on training to equip them for in-demand jobs in today’s economy. Lewis’ amendment ensures that parents and students are aware of dual and concurrent enrollment opportunities available and encourages the development of articulation agreements to make sure that postsecondary credits earned in dual enrollment are transferable toward a recognized postsecondary credential.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepJasonLewis/videos/1903568336550846/",NA,118,35,11,9,0,0,0,6

We have to protect our children’s future from Washington’s unsustainable and reckless spending. If you break down our $20 trillion national debt, every man, women, and child owes $60,000. We need to make tough decisions, by funding programs that actually work for Americans and making sensible reforms to tackle the debt.   The Administration, for the first time in years, has sent us a budget that balances – and that's a necessity. While I don’t agree with each and every policy in the President’s budget request, I am pleased that the Administration shares my goal of getting back to fiscal sanity.   The federal government is collecting a record amount of taxes from Americans, and yet Washington continues to spend its way into deficits that are projected to triple over the next 30 years.

It’s clear to me that drones have a growing role to play in interstate commerce, and that’s vital to maintaining our economic strength at home and competitiveness on the world stage.   The Drone Innovation Act will promote that spirit of invention by establishing a clear framework for the operation of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). Importantly, my legislation also lays out clear protections for your right to privacy and gives local governments the primary responsibility in forming guidelines for how drones can be used in our communities.   I look forward to working with the FAA to maintain an environment that works for all stakeholders, and thank my colleagues for their support.""  Congresswoman Brownley said: “Congress needs to do more to spur innovation in this exciting new field of aviation, while at the same time promoting the safe integration of unmanned systems into the national airspace. As this process moves forward, it's important that we explore the proper role of state and local governments in helping to foster innovation.

Secretary Price referred to the 28.2 million uninsured as “28.2 million promises broken.” The editorial labels the statistic “misleading” — while acknowledging its accuracy — and calls Price’s tweet “bizarre” and “disingenuous.”  The fact is that President Obama promised to “sign a universal health care bill into law that will cover every American,” as well as making the now-infamous claim that it would cut the cost of family premiums by up to $2,500 a year. Folks in Minnesota know that claim was indeed “disingenuous,” given that premiums have risen by 50 percent to 66 percent in back-to-back years. In fact, according to the most recent data, more than 94,000 Minnesotans paid the IRS nearly $20 million just for the right to go without the kind of health insurance Washington told them to buy.  Moreover, I’d bet the 100,000 Minnesotans who had their plans canceled don’t find Price’s tweet “bizarre,” but agree that it’s accurate.  Led by liberal commentators on these pages, our state jumped headlong into Obamacare. One result is that Minnesota spends $11 billion on Medicaid — $3 billion more than Wisconsin, with a larger population — and also just had to bail out MNsure with a $312 million premium support program. Despite massive tax increases on everything from over-the-counter medications to medical devices made right here in Minnesota, trillions in new spending, and thousands of new pages in regulations, Minnesotans still face skyrocketing costs and fewer coverage options.  I’ll continue to work with my colleagues — and with Tom Price — to help all Americans (including the 28.2 million who remain uninsured) get access to high-quality and, most important, affordable health care.

Jason Lewis","2017-07-28","2017-07-28 16:26:12","WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congressman Jason Lewis (MN-02) issued the following statement after the Senate failed to move forward on health care reform:  “Health care markets are in disarray, as premiums, along with deductibles, continue to skyrocket and Minnesota families are hurting. Yet the status-quo folks in Washington still don’t get it.   “Last night’s Senate capitulation was a political victory for the entrenched interests—from big insurance to big media—who fought so hard to preserve Obamacare. But as all too often is the case, it was a defeat for hard-working Americans. I was proud to support real health care reform that passed the House and tried to actually fix the failed experiment in government-run health care, including the problems that even predate the ACA. But Senate Democrats, and a few wayward Republicans, refused to even send a compromise to a conference committee to work with the House. This is not acceptable and the U.S. Senate must simply change its dysfunction.   “But make no mistake, bailing out a ‘too big to fail’ system is not the answer. So as markets continue to deteriorate, health care costs continue their climb, and as out-of-control entitlements threaten our nation’s fiscal solvency, Minnesotans should understand that the same folks who gave us this mess apparently have little interest in changing it. They even tout scores from the same CBO that erroneously said that 23 million Americans would get coverage through the ACA by 2016. They and so many others were wrong by over 10 million.   “Nevertheless, I will continue to fight for families in the 2nd district when it comes to affordable health care, tax reform and a rising tide of economic growth that benefits everyone.  That’s what I was sent to Washington to do and one setback won’t deter my commitment to that vision.”   ###","status",NA,NA,286,307,55,11,5,1,12,125

There’s a skills gap in our country as colleges push students to take a four-year degree instead of equipping them with the technical knowledge to get on the fast-track for an in-demand career.   My amendment would simply transfer the proposed funding increase from well-funded programs that encourage more four-year degrees and put that $70 million where it’s needed most: state grants to improve Career and Technical Education (CTE).   Encouraging CTE means that young people avoid debt and graduate school ready to succeed in a well-paid job.  CTE Statistics:  • High school graduation rate for students who concentrate in CTE is 93%, well above nation average of 80% • High-risk students are 8 to 10 times less likely to drop out in the 11th and 12th grade if enrolled in a CTE program • 4 out of 5 high school CTE graduates who pursued postsecondary education had earned a credential or were still enrolled 2 years later • 27% of people with less than an associate’s degree earn more than avg. bachelor’s degree  • Over 80% of manufactures report that talent shortages will impact their ability to meet customer demand • Currently, only 19% of high school students are concentrating in CTE, 81% are taking an academic route","status",NA,NA,232,47,23,20,1,1,0,10

The unbelievably complicated Obamacare bill was so destined to destroy healthcare markets that HHS--starting under the law's own architects like Kathleen Sebelius-- granted over 1200 waivers by 2012--in many cases outright favors to certain states, companies, unions, or collections of companies in a given representative’s district.

Jason Lewis","2017-09-27","2017-09-27 19:35:03","My statement on the tax reform framework:   American families and businesses suffer under some of the highest tax rates in the world, and consequently families have less income and businesses create fewer jobs. Our economy has been stuck in low gear for years, growing far slower than the post-WWII average of 3.3%. As a result, median family incomes have failed to keep pace since the 2007 recession.   Today, that changes. Our tax reform plan doubles the standard deduction, which will massively reduce the tax burden on millions of families and allow them to file their returns on a postcard. It encourages investment and capital formation by lowering rates on small business pass-through income. And we finally end the outdated practice of being the only industrialized nation to tax foreign profits twice—once abroad and again when proceeds are brought back for investment here at home.    I want a tax code that promotes economic growth—not one that merely divvies up a shrinking economic pie. It’s time to close the tax loopholes so we can embrace good policy where everyone has skin in the game--but at much lower rates. This plan is about defending the American Dream—the right to fly as high as your wings will take you.   As John F. Kennedy said when he unveiled his proposed tax cuts in 1962: ‘The present patchwork of special provisions lightens the tax loads of some only at the cost of placing a heavier burden on others. It distorts economic judgments and channels undue amounts of energy into efforts to avoid tax liability... In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now...’   JFK was right. Tax reform not only worked then, but whenever it’s been tried—in the ‘20s, the ‘60s and the ‘80s. And it will work today for America’s families and business.”","status",NA,NA,152,129,13,15,1,2,0,32

By passing this budget, we’ve begun the process of reforming our broken tax code, making it vastly simpler, doubling the standard deduction, and cutting taxes for the middle class and small businesses.  “Today also represents a win for everyone who wants to leave a better and more prosperous society for their children. By finally tackling mandatory spending and returning to a budget that balances, we’ll restore much-needed fiscal responsibility to the federal government and help preserve the American Dream for the next generation.”  Background: Building a Better America is the House Budget Committee’s blueprint for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018. The budget balances within 10 years by addressing spending, reforming government, and growing the economy. The budget produces a $9 billion surplus in FY2027, and achieves $6.5 trillion in total deficit reduction over 10 years. It provides reconciliation instructions for tax reform in order to lower rates and simplify the complex tax code.","video","https://youtu.be/uOHi3JWXg74",NA,123,70,13,7,11,1,2,36

While sensible reforms need to be made to ensure Medicare is still viable for seniors in the future, IPAB was a total misstep and I’m glad to have been able to protect the doctor-patient relationship our seniors have through Medicare.”  Background: H.R. 849 terminates the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) which has the unprecedented authority to unilaterally alter Medicare policy, could ultimately reduce seniors’ access to health care, and puts the government at the center of our health care system.    IPAB:  - Puts the government – rather than patients and doctors – at the center of our health care system by allowing the board to unilaterally alter Medicate policy   - Puts 15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats – whose decisions can only be overridden by supermajority vote in Congress – in control of Medicare. If no board members are appointed, the HHS Secretary would be solely responsible for developing the legislation to cut Medicare to achieve the savings target. - Is free from judicial review and delegates far too much power to the Executive Branch - Calls for new cuts in addition to the more than $800 billion Obamacare took from Medicare to spend on new enrollment programs - While the current Medicare program is unstable, allowing a panel of bureaucrats to make critical health care decisions instead of patients and their families is the wrong approach - H.R. 849 is strongly bipartisan","status",NA,NA,115,52,10,15,0,0,1,25

We're working to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans by cosponsoring H.R. 4261, the Safe, Accountable, Fair, and Effective (SAFE) Justice Act    Since 1980, Congress usurped state and local authority by putting more than 4500 federal crimes on the books—including arbitrary mandatory minimums that in some cases throw non-violent or first-time offenders in jail, leading to a vicious cycle of recidivism. There are better ways to spend Americans’ tax dollars and keep our communities safe through real evidence-based initiatives that actually reduce crime by reserving costly prison space for hardened criminals.

Here’s what they said about our criminal justice reform bill:   “I strongly commend the bipartisan efforts of Congressmen Bobby Scott and Jason Lewis to introduce the SAFE Justice Act,” said Hilary Shelton, Director of the NAACP’s Washington Bureau, and Senior Vice President for Advocacy and Policy.  “The SAFE Justice Act adopts models that states have used to successfully cut prison costs and the prison population while reducing crime rates.  It will effectively reform our expensive and ineffective criminal justice system by focusing mandatory minimums on drug kingpins, as Congress originally intended.  It will reinvest prison savings into people by improving early prevention and intervention programs, prison programs, and reentry programs.  Congress should immediately pass this bill and I urge President Trump to sign it into law.”   “The principles underlying the SAFE Justice Act would increase public safety, foster human dignity, and hold the Bureau of Prisons more accountable for the billions in taxpayer money it spends,” said David Safavian, the Deputy Director of the American Conservative Union Foundation.  “These are principles on which Liberals and Conservatives can find common ground.”","status",NA,NA,49,11,5,5,0,0,0,0

Jason Lewis","2017-11-09","2017-11-09 20:47:35","Lewis introduces College Completion and Success Act, H.R. 4336:   “Students make a big investment in a college education to earn a degree and enter the workforce with the right skills. There’s a completion crisis in this country as far too many young people drop out and end up owing huge sums of money with no degree to show for it- and with taxpayers on the hook for federal loans. Colleges must be more engaged in the academic success of their students, especially students from less-advantaged backgrounds. My legislation puts more financial responsibility on colleges to ensure they do their job and keep students on the pathway to a bright future.”  Background:   Only about 55% of full-time students attending 4-year institutions actually make it to graduation. The numbers are even lower for part-time students and those attending 2-year institutions. Students who do not earn a degree are three times more likely to default on their loans, leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab.  The College Completion and Success Act reforms the burdensome institutional refund process so colleges do not “earn” all of a student’s financial aid until the student actually completes the semester. By streamlining how colleges calculate the amount of aid earned, schools will be able to spend less time and resources on compliance. The bill shifts the primary burden of repaying unearned aid onto the colleges, giving them a strong incentive to promote student persistence and success. Taxpayers’ investment in higher education is protected when student completion is not achieved and students benefit by regaining Pell eligibility, increasing their ability to return to school and complete a degree.","status",NA,NA,80,51,5,7,1,0,0,15

In too many instances we have seen the federal government put roadblock after roadblock in the way of important infrastructure projects nationwide.

Ultimately, the people who live here know best how to protect our land, while also providing vital opportunities to use the natural resources we have been blessed with to benefit our citizens and their families.”  Background:  H.R. 3905, the Minnesota’s Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest (MINER) Act: • Halts northern Minnesota mineral withdrawals by requiring Congressional approval for these actions • Ensures National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review for any reinstated or future leases • Ensures strict environmental review for any projects proposed in the area, as established under current law • Expressly affirms Minnesota’s commitment to restricting any mineral development in the Boundary Waters or its state and federal buffer zones  H.R. 3115, the Superior National Forest Land Exchange Act  • Ratifies the appraised land values and objectives of the NorthMet Land Exchange  • Does not authorize any mining to occur • Does not affect the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness or the Rainy River Watershed  • The land exchange allocates 6,690 acres of private lands to the Forest Service and allocates 6,650 acres of Federal surface land to PolyMet","status",NA,NA,132,143,5,16,0,0,3,60

Jason Lewis","2017-12-01","2017-12-01 18:45:17","Congressman Jason Lewis released the following statement after Education & Workforce Committee Chairwoman Foxx introduced the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform Act, or PROSPER Act, a higher education reauthorization and reform bill that contains Lewis’ H.R. 4336, the College Completion and Success Act:  “One of my top priorities is equipping our young people with the skills they need to succeed in the 21st Century economy. With six million unfilled jobs in this country, we clearly need a new approach to higher education that provides additional options in order to meet the needs of both our economy and our students. Many students prefer a two-year or technical qualification that leads straight to a well-paid, skilled job, and we need to make those opportunities more widely available with apprenticeships and work/study programs that give students relevant on-the-job experience. That’s why I was glad to see my dual enrollment amendment already pass the House and give young people the chance to gain practical experience even while in high school.  “Regardless of the educational path they choose, we need to make sure students are graduating prepared to thrive in the workforce - and my College Completion and Success Act, included in the PROSPER Act, actually reforms the student aid system so that schools have skin in the game and are incentivized to help them do better. I’m proud to support this bill and look forward to helping these historic reforms become law.”","status",NA,NA,64,76,2,5,0,1,0,17

The Constitution gives, and the Supreme Court has upheld in two recent decisions, an individual right to bear arms. For many, a concealed carry permit is a way to feel secure wherever they go- and in fact, women are the fastest-growing group of applicants for these permits.   “Your right to be safe, just like to drive, doesn’t end at the state line with arbitrary limits on travel. If you are a law-abiding citizen with a permit for a concealed carry- and you’d have to comply with a host state’s laws- you shouldn’t have to turn around every time you reach the bridge to Wisconsin. And to make sure that criminals and bad actors aren’t able to get these permits, we also ensure our background check system has the most accurate and up-to-date information from government agencies and the states.   “This protects the right of responsible Minnesotans to self-defense wherever they are.”","status",NA,NA,215,179,18,30,0,0,9,143

I’m glad to see an audit finally beginning (as has been in law since 1990). I’ve been calling for this since my arrival in Congress, with my Defense Spending Accountability Act and language in the House Budget highlighting the importance of the audit.   “It’s important that we use what we learn from an audit to reduce waste and make the Pentagon much more accountable to the people it serves. Military readiness doesn’t equal spending for spending’s sake. We can have the best military in the world and tackle our national debt simultaneously, and I look forward to the results of the audit helping to guide the government in making progress on both of these important goals.”  Background: The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has placed DOD on the High Risk List since 1995.  This means DOD has had sustained and uncorrected deficiencies, on a massive scale, in their financial management. As GAO has stated, this has hindered the DOD’s ability to make sound and financially prudent decisions. This not only wastes taxpayer dollars, it also makes it harder to ensure military readiness.  The Washington Post reported that the Pentagon buried a report that showed $125 billion in administrative waste- read it here. This is the first-ever audit of the DOD’s $2.4 trillion in assets.

Long before I arrived in Congress, I spent the better part of two decades advocating that putting more money in the hands of the people who earned it is always a good idea. I’m keeping that commitment to Minnesotans by voting to cut taxes on hardworking Minnesota families and businesses.  Our bill doubles the standard deduction, gives a rate cut to everyone, in each bracket, and drastically reduces taxes on Minnesota entrepreneurs. By making our tax code internationally competitive, it also gives companies the right incentives to stay in the United States, to hire our friends and neighbors, and to give folks a raise.  In the New Year, families will see more of their hard-earned money in their paycheck, and we’ll spend less time worrying about filing our tax returns.
