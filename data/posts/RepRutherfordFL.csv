Speaking about the hearing, Congressman Rutherford said, “As the administration focuses on securing our southern borders, it is important we continue to secure our coastal borders, as well. Cartels and drug runners seek to exploit our maritime borders for trafficking, and Florida plays a strategic role in drug interdiction at sea. The safety and security of the First Coast and the Port of Jacksonville must remain a top priority. I commend Secretary Kelly for his commitment to support our U.S. Coast Guard units and keep all borders safe. I look forward to working with him and the Committee further to ensure the safety and protection of all Americans.”","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepRutherfordFL/videos/164459570718114/",NA,78,20,29,2,0,0,0,0

Just this week, we saw two more announcements of insurance carriers leaving the marketplace, leaving consumers with few or even no choices for coverage. Obamacare has given us fewer choices, skyrocketing premiums, higher deductibles, and higher taxes. It is not working and we must act. I promised the people of Northeast Florida that we would protect them from this misguided law, and today we have voted to do just that.  “The American Health Care Act repeals Obamacare, its mandates, taxes, and rules, which will lower consumer costs. It replaces it with a system that empowers individuals and families to obtain affordable, quality health care coverage. No longer will Americans be mandated to buy a plan they cannot afford, do not want, and cannot even use. The legislation maintains the guarantee that Americans with pre-existing conditions will have affordable coverage, and it continues to allow children to stay on their parents’ plan until age 26.  “While this represents a big step toward the market-based reforms needed to make health care more affordable and accessible for all, we must continue to drive down the cost of health care. I will continue working to increase access to quality, affordable health care for every Northeast Florida family.”  https://rutherford.house.gov/media/press-releases/rutherford-votes-repeal-and-replace-obamacare","link","https://rutherford.house.gov/media/press-releases/rutherford-votes-repeal-and-replace-obamacare","rutherford.house.gov",153,402,67,25,1,0,10,217

It was a powerful message and signal to the Afghan people, our allies, and terrorists that America will not lead from behind when it comes to threats of terror that can hurt our citizens and our allies.  With last night’s address to the nation, the President demonstrated his ability to thoughtfully consider advice from his national security team, make a decision based on national security priorities rather than political goals, and clearly articulate the implications of these decisions to the American people and most importantly our brave servicemen and women at home and abroad.  The key pillars of this strategy – using conditions on the ground rather than artificial timelines to make military decisions, integrating our instruments of diplomatic, economic, and military power to reach our goals, and abandoning nation-building as a goal – are strong and prudent.  I also applaud the President for applying pressure on Pakistan and recognizing that they cannot continue to be a safe haven for the terror that threatens the region and the world.  We in Congress will continue to conduct oversight over American military operations in Afghanistan to ensure that we adhere to the guidelines the President set forth in his speech.

The letter is being led by Members in Congress who were previously in the Armed Forces, Rep. Kinzinger, Rep. Gallagher, and Rep. McSally.  I believe it is time for Congress and federal regulators to evaluate the regulation of bump-stocks. I signed onto a letter sent to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives urging them to re-evaluate the regulation of bump-stock devices. On the morning of October 2nd, we were shocked to awaken to news of the horrific event in Las Vegas and the role bump-stocks may have played. It is our duty as legislators to review policies to keep our citizens safe while ensuring the protection of our constitutional rights.  Read a copy of the letter below:   The Honorable Thomas E. Brandon Acting Director Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives 99 New York Ave NE Washington, DC 20226   On the morning of October 2, we were shocked and appalled to awaken to news of the horrific events that occurred during the night at a concert in Las Vegas.  As a nation, we mourn the loss of life, we condemn the senseless and evil attack on these innocent victims, and we praise the brave actions by our first responders and bystanders alike.    Reports in the aftermath of this tragedy indicate that the perpetrator may have used a commercially available mechanism to modify the rate at which his weapons were able to discharge. Commonly called a bump-stock—also known as a “slide fire”—this mechanism is designed to replace the weapon’s original shoulder stock to allow the rest of the weapon to slide backward and forward, harnessing the kinetic energy of the weapon’s recoil to allow for a more rapid trigger pull, thereby dramatically increasing the rate of discharge.   It is also our understanding that this mechanism is technically legal under the National Firearms Act (26 U.S.C. 5845(b)) and the Gun Control Act (18 U.S.C. 921(a)(23)). In fact, we have enclosed two letters from the Firearms Technology Branch (FTB) of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) dated June 7, 2010 and April 2, 2012 which indicate this mechanism is not implicated by the laws that apply to machineguns.  In light of the tragic events in Las Vegas, we respectfully request that FTB-ATF work expeditiously to re-evaluate bump stocks and similar mechanisms to ensure full compliance with federal law. If the re- evaluation shows otherwise, we request that you move swiftly to issue appropriate rulings concerning the manufacture, sale, transfer, and importation of these mechanisms, as well as any other mechanism that is expressly designed to simulate the automatic rate of fire of a machinegun. For our part, we will be studying legislative options to close any loopholes that might exist in current statutes governing the regulation of machineguns.   We trust that you will undertake this request expeditiously and thoroughly, and we thank you for your thoughtful consideration. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us directly.   Sincerely,","status",NA,NA,222,134,21,15,1,0,1,7

His testimony was critical to allowing Congress to hold the FBI accountable to the American people. As former Sheriff, I often think about the perceived politicization of our law enforcement agencies and the impact that could have on operations. That is why my colleagues are so concerned regarding the private communications by FBI personnel tasked with the Clinton investigation. This type of bias goes against the ethics of the FBI and of other law enforcement agencies – the American people deserve impartial enforcement of our laws.
