Conservatives support this legislation for many reasons, including that it massively shrinks the federal government and protects our economy at large.   ""Conservative critics are discounting these and other benefits because the bill isn’t everything they imagine, but they’re missing the larger and rarer opportunity. ObamaCare was designed to expand over time, reaching deeper and deeper into the middle class and displacing ever-more private health insurance. This private market decomposition has been slower than expected because the Obama Administration botched the law’s design.  ""But if ObamaCare continues on present trend, the result will inevitably be much higher levels of taxation across society. As the entitlement state’s obligations consume more GDP, the economy’s long-term growth trend will further decline and there will be fewer jobs, as the European welfare-state experience demonstrates.  ""If conservatives fumble this repeal-and-replace moment, they won’t get another chance. And they’ll have squandered their best opening in a generation to control the size and scope of the federal Leviathan.""  https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-health-bills-fiscal-bonus-1489531943","link","https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-health-bills-fiscal-bonus-1489531943","wsj.com",16,29,5,2,0,0,0,1

Republicans have confidence in the potential of the American worker to make our country grow again—that’s why they are the foundation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   We’re giving job creators more reasons to invest in America's workforce, strengthening our economy and our communities. We’re making the IRS less ravenous and putting more money back in the hands of American families so that they can pursue more of their ambitions on their own terms.   A decade of the status quo has guaranteed us only a stagnant economy. Republicans promised to reform a broken, bloated tax system so that Americans can chart a path out of economic anxiety and into economic empowerment. We’re keeping that promise today.","status",NA,NA,112,105,10,10,2,0,1,40
