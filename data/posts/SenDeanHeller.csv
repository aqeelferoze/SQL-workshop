It recognizes Obamacare's failed one-size-fits-all approach and empowers states as decision-making will leave Washington. By allowing states to address the unique health care needs of their populations, it gives states the flexibility to innovate and come up with a tailored approach that is most appropriate for their citizens. In Nevada, this means supporting programs that are currently working in our state and exploring new options to address coverage and cost. The goal of health care reform should be to increase choice, lower costs, and improve the quality of care in this country, and I believe this proposal is the best way to go.","status",NA,NA,461,1561,94,36,12,10,30,774

Americans are already feeling the positive impact of this bill given that immediately after its passage, several companies announced they plan to increase wages and give their employees bonuses. I encourage all Nevadans to compare their paychecks today to the ones they’ll receive in February; they’re going to be bigger because our bill allows you to keep more of your hard-earned money. This is particularly important at a time when nearly 8 in 10 Americans who work full-time are living paycheck to paycheck, Nevadans real median household income is down $7,000 from 10 years ago, and at a time when the cost of housing and childcare expenses continue to skyrocket.  Nevadans have been waiting for a break, and this is it. For example, this bill includes my provision to double the child tax credit from current law and provides relief to tens of thousands of Nevadans by eliminating Obamacare’s individual mandate tax penalty. From bringing Secretary Mnuchin to Nevada to hear directly from my constituents to working closely with Ivanka Trump to increase the child tax credit, I’ve made sure that Nevadans voices were heard by the Administration and my colleagues as we worked with the White House to put together and pass the first tax relief package in more than 30 years.
