In the dark of night, in a secret vote, the majority breached public trust by disempowering the sole independent investigatory body holding lawmakers accountable for ethics violations.  This action exposes Republicans’ campaign pledge of ‘drain the swamp’ as absolute parody.  Furthermore, instead of protecting American families from the devastating effects of gun violence, House Republicans have responded to last year's historic Democratic sit-in by proposing potentially unconstitutional punishments for Members who participate in similar actions in the future. This is unacceptable, and Democrats will not be intimidated out of fiercely advocating for policies that save American lives.  The Republican rules package includes brazen assaults on the integrity of the House, and I urge all of my colleagues to reject this package.  https://lowey.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/lowey-statement-proposed-house-republican-rules-package","link","https://lowey.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/lowey-statement-proposed-house-republican-rules-package","lowey.house.gov",271,51,62,9,0,1,2,47

Making matters worse, this order removed the Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from being permanent members of the Principals Committee. Promoting a controversial political aide over policy experts is unprecedented and reckless.  Let me be clear: Mr. Bannon is woefully unqualified to serve as a White House official, let alone on the NSC or the Principals Committee. In his previous role as Chairman of Breitbart News, Mr. Bannon aggressively dispersed inflammatory stories and fake news, and espoused right-wing, anti-Semitic, and xenophobic views that aren’t in line with American values and won’t help keep our country safe.  That’s why I’ve cosponsored H.R. 804, the Protect the National Security Council from Political Interference Act of 2017, which would prohibit Mr. Bannon’s appointment to the NSC, and I’ve called for Bannon to be removed from the White House staff.
