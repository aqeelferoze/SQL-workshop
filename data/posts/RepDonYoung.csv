Today’s announcement by ConocoPhillips – a discovery in the NPR-A that  could yield 300 million barrels of oil – is living proof that Alaska’s abundant energy sector is alive and well. Although we face many challenges, many at the hands of an unwilling federal partner, there is great hope that we will once again fill the Trans-Alaska pipeline, provide high-paying/quality jobs for our workforce and reignite an industry which has provided so much for our state.

However, in Alaska and across the nation we’ve seen the exact opposite. The facts speak for themselves. Year after year, Alaskans have faced skyrocketing premiums and soaring deductibles – pricing hardworking individuals and families out of access to healthcare entirely. The promise for increased competition and lower prices represents another major failure in this law, as insurers flee the individual marketplace and leave Alaska and more than one third of U.S. counties with just one insurer in 2017.  Simply put, the real world application of this government-knows-best mandate has resulted in broken promises, inadequate results and a demand for change from the American people.   In many ways, we are at a fundamental crossroads – a law on the verge of collapse and a unique opportunity, granted by the American people, to transition towards a more stable healthcare system. Given the numerous consequences of the law, I have chosen, without reservation, to move forward with a process to repeal and replace this unworkable law. This budget resolution represents the first step in an effort to transition away from Obamacare, and move towards a system that gives American consumers the choice and flexibility they need and deserve.","link","http://donyoung.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398828","donyoung.house.gov",69,52,12,7,0,0,0,18

It left those tasked with implementing this policy with inadequate information and little direction, and resulted in what many believe to be the wrongful detention of certain lawful residents of the United States. The White House and the Department of Homeland Security are working to clarify this language, including a clear exception for green card holders, to ensure its implementation is consistent with its intent.  This administration has made it very clear – throughout the election cycle and since entering office – they are focused on protecting the American people from foreign and emerging threats. Ultimately, I support the goals of increased security, additional screening and added layers of safety. I believe we must do everything in our power to ensure our immigration system is complete, thorough and capable of examining threats – particularly from some of the most dangerous regions of the globe.

Today, I proudly introduced the Digital Coast Act, an important step towards developing a system that supports our coastal communities with up-to-date and reliable information on our coastlines and weather conditions.

As we begin to gather around the dinner table with friends and family, I'm reminded of the many things to be thankful for this holiday season. I am forever grateful for love of family, for the gift of good health and for the honor to know the Lord from a very young age. I am eternally thankful to our men and women in uniform who continue to serve this nation and protect our freedoms. And I am forever honored by the responsibility Alaskans have entrusted in me to serve in Congress.   God Bless and may you have a very wonderful Thanksgiving!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDonYoung/photos/a.10152409483709852.1073741834.7476269851/10157331585299852/?type=3",NA,89,27,2,11,0,0,2,4

Earlier this week, we successfully took the first step in opening the 1002 area to responsible energy production. I am encouraged by the U.S. Geological Survey’s revised estimates for how much technically recoverable oil and natural gas is in and around the NPRA and OCS planning area.  Our natural resources can and should be developed in a safe, responsible way to maintain affordable energy prices for the American people. I have always supported an “all-of-the-above” energy policy, and that must include oil and gas production in Alaska. Not only will moving forward with development of the 1002, NPRA, and Arctic OCS increase American energy independence, but it will maintain the security and increase the lifespan of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. I am proud to continue to work with this Administration to further the interests of Alaskans and the nation as a whole.

This extension will provide fishing and small commercial vessels relief as Congress pursues a permanent exemption to a patchwork of burdensome federal and state regulations for vessel ballast water and incidental discharges.  Without this bill, fishermen and small vessel operators would be forced to get permits for simple things like hosing out their fish holds and vessel deck runoff which is a prime example of over-regulation. While this is a short-term fix to a long-term problem, the Alaska delegation has been developing a more permanent solution to this frivolous and burdensome rule issued by the EPA. I look forward to addressing this issue when Congress returns next year so we can implement a permanent solution.   https://donyoung.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=399082","link","https://donyoung.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=399082","donyoung.house.gov",79,22,8,8,0,0,0,20
