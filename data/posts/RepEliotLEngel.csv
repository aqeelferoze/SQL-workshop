Engel (NY), Ranking Member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Representative Gerald E. Connolly (VA) are leading a group of more than 50 lawmakers to offer legislation that would punish illegal foreign interference in an American election. The SECURE Our Democracy Act would sanction any foreign individual or entity found to have unlawfully meddled with a federal election, and would bar entry to the United States and freeze U.S.-based assets of anyone involved in such interference.    “Our intelligence and law enforcement communities are unanimous in their assessment that Russia worked to rig our election. This is an attack on our country, and it cannot go unanswered. If the criminals who interfered with our election get away with it, what’s to stop our enemies from doing the same thing the next time Americans cast their votes? This bill would mete out tough penalties to those who tried to undermine our democracy, and it would put any other would-be meddlers on notice: stay out of our business or face the consequences,” said Rep. Engel. “Every member of the House should cosponsor this bill. I hope in the days ahead, we build the sort of bipartisan support around this issue we're seeing in the Senate under the leadership of Senators McCain and Graham.”   “The U.S. Intelligence Community recently shared an unclassified report detailing an unprecedented, deliberate, and multi-faceted campaign by Russia to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. That should trouble every American,” said Rep. Connolly. “One of our most cherished institutions, democratic elections free of foreign interference, was attacked. Congress must come together in a bipartisan fashion to demonstrate that there is a cost to such attacks on American democratic institutions.    “I am glad to join with Ranking Member Engel to introduce legislation that would publicly identify and authorize sanctions against foreign persons and governments that unlawfully interfere in U.S. federal elections. I applaud the Obama Administration for releasing this intelligence assessment. Our bill seeks to standardize this transparency measure because exposing these tactics is the best way to nullify them.”   Among the bill's cosponsors are Ranking Members Nita Lowey (NY) of the Appropriations Committee; Adam Smith (WA) of the Armed Services Committee; Bennie Thompson (MS) of the Homeland Security Committee; Adam Schiff (CA) of the Permanent Select Intelligence Committee; John Conyers, Jr. (MI) of the Judiciary Committee; and Elijah Cummings (MD) of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Click here for a complete list of the bill’s original cosponsors.   The SECURE Our Democracy Act would require the Secretary of State to compile and regularly update a public list of foreign persons and entities who, at any time since January 1, 2015, unlawfully interfered in U.S. elections for federal office. Those on the list would be barred from entering the United States and have their financial assets in this country frozen. Similar sanctions have won strong bipartisan support and have been used successfully against terrorists, drug traffickers, and human rights violators. The bill would also require the Secretary to submit a report to Congress after each federal election summarizing any foreign interference in the previous cycle, offering the American people an official report.  The SECURE Our Democracy Act would cost zero taxpayer dollars.","status",NA,NA,56,2,2,0,0,0,0,0

Dr. King talked throughout his life about racial and economic equality. He talked about expanding voting rights, and making sure that working people got a fair shake. Of course, he also talked about the injustice and violence facing the black community, and the need for true civil rights for all Americans. He said, ‘The goal of America is freedom,’ but he sadly wrote those words from a Birmingham jail cell.   We can all be proud of some of the ways we’ve reached for Dr. King’s goal together in the last eight years. We achieved nationwide marriage equality for our LGBT family and friends. We made lifesaving healthcare available to millions who couldn’t afford it before. We lifted American families away from the threat of a second Great Depression and created more than 11 million jobs. And we saw one of Dr. King’s dreams realized when we elected an African-American to be President of the United States.    It’s strange to think that President Obama is more optimistic now than he was in January 2009, as he said in Chicago last week. But this was part of the point of Dr. King’s letter from that Birmingham jail: when we come up against enormous obstacles, the solution is to work even harder, and have faith that our work can change things.   I am committed to pressing forward this Congress with an ambitious agenda to make America’s elections fairer, safer, and more open; reform the justice system; expand access to healthcare; protect America from cyber threats; reduce carbon emissions; and safeguard America’s values, both at home and abroad. And when need be, I will fight as hard as I can to protect the advances we’ve made so that our country can continue moving forward rather than back. President Obama’s mounting optimism is a testament to our ability to get these things done – to get closer to Dr. King’s goal – if we all work together.","status",NA,NA,153,15,7,7,0,0,0,0

This policy forces health-care providers to cut services for women, increase fees, and even close clinics. Often, those providers are the only ones who offer even basic health care to poor and remote areas.  By prohibiting caregivers from providing information on essential care, President Trump's Global Gag Rule breaks the vital trust shared by patients and providers at the expense of good health care.  I am deeply disturbed that the President has taken this devastating action just days into his administration. As Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I will make every effort to defend women and girls worldwide against this administration's harmful anti-woman agenda.  Background:  Under President Trump's Global Gag Rule, foreign NGOs must choose between receiving U.S. funding or providing women with life-saving, comprehensive reproductive health care. As a condition of receiving U.S. foreign assistance under Trump’s rule, NGOs may not provide legal abortions or counseling for women seeking abortions, even if the activities are funded privately. The Trump Rule also bars NGOs from educating the public on the significant dangers that unsafe abortion poses.","status",NA,NA,127,19,14,1,0,2,1,19

But today’s actions prove the President is undeterred in pursuing this anti-immigrant track, and all Americans should be worried by it.   The President’s proposals will not improve America’s immigration system, nor will they help ease any of America’s economic or security concerns. A border wall won’t make us safer when the vast majority of undocumented immigrants come into the country by airplane. Taking away billions in funding from America’s largest cities won’t create jobs. Rounding up ethnic minorities suspected of being undocumented won’t ‘restore law and order.’ Yes, the current immigration system has problems. But we need commonsense, comprehensive reform, not policy that plays to people’s fears.   Americans across the country have to stay strong in the face of these dangerous ideas.

Engel, Ranking Member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, today urged President Trump not to lift sanctions on Russia.  In a letter to the President, Rep. Engel voiced his concerns about comments from White House counselor Kellyanne Conway that lifting sanctions was “under consideration” before the President’s Saturday call with Vladimir Putin.  “Vladimir Putin means our country harm, and his actions and aggression have destabilized Europe.  Until he changes his behavior, lifting sanctions on him is unthinkable,” said Rep. Engel. “In fact, we should be doing more.  I recently introduced a bill to punish foreign interference in our elections, which I hope House leaders will act quickly on.  Representative Engel continued, “Last year, the House unanimously passed my bill that would make Crimea-related sanctions on Russia permanent until Putin changes course.  Now, as we face the possibility of a new Administration unduly lifting those sanctions, it may be critical for Congress to play its role and hold Putin accountable. If it becomes necessary, I hope my colleagues on the other side will put country before party and take a strong stand against the threat Russia poses to our security and global stability.”  Text of Rep. Engel’s letter to President Trump follows and can be found here.  Dear Mr. President:  This morning, your advisor Kellyanne Conway said in an interview that lifting sanctions on Russia is ""under consideration"" as you prepare to speak with President Putin on Saturday. Such an action would be a catastrophic misstep. I strongly urge you not to take any action that would reduce pressure on Russia until Mr. Putin ceases his destabilizing policies of sowing violence and chaos beyond Russia's borders.  Mr. Putin's hostile actions and rhetoric risk the decades of American efforts to secure a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace. His aggression has cost tens of thousands of lives and brought war to Europe. Our sanctions regime may not have reversed Russia's gains, but it has imposed a price upon the Kremlin’s military advance toward our allies in Europe. And our resolve in confronting this threat has reassured our largest trading partners on the Continent. Premature sanctions relief on Russia would signal a dangerous and provocative weakness on our part and jeopardize other sanctions programs that the United States uses to promote our national interests.  Congress has advanced stronger measures to deter Russia's aggression and strengthen the position of the United States while keeping the door open to cooperation where advisable or necessary. Yet, until Russia halts its aggression and reverses its illegal occupation, I strongly urge you to maintain American sanctions on Russia.  Sincerely,  ELIOT L.

In 1939, when Jewish refugees aboard the ship St. Louis could look ashore and see the lights of Miami, they thought the United States would be their salvation. But the power of fear and cowardice prevailed, sending those poor souls back across the ocean, many to their deaths. That moment is a stain on our country's history, and one that ran contrary to America's best values and traditions.  Today, fear and cowardice are winning again. President Trump is slamming the door on the world's most desperate refugees, whose eyes are gazing upon our shores today, seeking the promise of America that has illuminated the world for more than two centuries.  He's building a wall and banning a religion, actions that won't keep us any safer, but will send a message that if you aren't a certain color, or don't speak a certain language or worship a certain way, you don't have a place in America. He's turning America's back on children who made a dangerous journey to escape violence and poverty, telling the huddled masses to find refuge elsewhere.  In our best moments, America has been synonymous with freedom, hope, justice, and opportunity. That's not the America the world sees today.  When Ronald Reagan likened America to a shining city upon a hill, he envisioned a place ‘teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace.’ Our beacon shines dimmer today, and I fear we've lost our way.

Korematsu was a Japanese-American civil rights activist who was jailed for fleeing the Japanese internment camps during World War II under Executive Order 9066. Mr. Korematsu sued the U.S. government, arguing that mass internment of ethnic minorities violated the U.S. Constitution. In 1944, he lost that argument in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. That the Supreme Court of the United States could sign off on mass detention of an ethnic minority should remind us all: this has happened here before, and it can happen here again.  The President’s Muslim ban – which the White House has said that they plan to expand in the future – undermines our values in the same ways as Japanese internment camps did in the 1940s. And just as it was in the 40’s, it is fear and ignorance that are the driving forces behind these compromises of our values, masked under the veil of ‘security’. These men, women, and children who seek refuge here only want the same things as we do: a chance at a better life, lived free. But the administration has denied them that chance, with an executive order so brazen that it is obvious they are playing the same prejudicial games the U.S. played with refugees and ethnic minorities 75 years ago.  From turning back the Jews on the St. Louis to Japanese internment and beyond, we have witnessed these moments of profound darkness in our country before. It takes only a handful of officials at the highest levels of government to turn these repulsive ideas into the official policy of the United States. I am relieved that the Courts have put a hold on deportations under this ban, and I am grateful for the thousands who have stood up across the country to protest the President’s actions. But Mr. Korematsu’s story reminds us all how important the Supreme Court is, and it reminds us how easily we can fall into these horrible patterns if we do not stay vigilant.","status",NA,NA,92,3,4,2,0,0,4,1

It’s fitting that we had an ACA hearing today, on Groundhog Day. Because at the hearing, Republicans brought the same ill-advised bills we’ve debated over and over again. There was one exception: a half-written draft that, they claim, would protect Americans living with pre-existing conditions – but, when you look closely, would punish them instead.  The situation Republicans have created is indefensible.  My constituents are frightened. They’re worried that the preventive services the ACA guaranteed them free-of-charge are going to disappear. They’re worried that insurance companies will again impose caps on their coverage. They’re worried that, without the ACA’s protections, they’ll be charged more for insurance. And my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are doing nothing to allay their fears.  The draft presented today would require insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing health conditions. However, there is nothing in the text that prevents insurance companies from charging you more if you have a pre-existing condition, like asthma or diabetes. Under such legislation, Americans with pre-existing conditions could be priced out of the care they need.  Lately, we hear Republicans use the phrase ‘universal access’ – as in, they want everyone to have universal access to health care. They’re careful to say access – not coverage – because this is what universal access is: a scheme in which insurers must cover you, but can charge you whatever they want, making it all but impossible for you to actually afford coverage.  This is why they choose their words so carefully: because the ‘access’ they’re promising isn’t truly access at all.  “For seven years, Republicans have claimed to have a better way to reform America’s health care system. If that were true, this hearing would have been the perfect opportunity to lay out that path forward.  But instead, after seven years, they gave the American people tired bills and half a draft.  My constituents have serious concerns. And it’s going to take a lot more than this to put those concerns to rest.","status",NA,NA,73,6,10,0,0,0,3,6

The Congressional Budget Office has now revealed exactly what the GOP was hiding.   According to CBO, the GOP bill to repeal the ACA will take insurance coverage away from 14 million Americans by 2018. Not a few Americans, not some—millions. That number will grow to 21 million in 2020, and 24 million in 2026.   This estimate – while staggering – is not unexpected, given the policies included in the Republican bill.   Their proposal radically structures the Medicaid program in a way that will force states to ration care, including care for children. In addition, their bill terminates the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid, which allowed more than 12 million Americans to gain health coverage. The GOP bill also eliminates the ACA’s premium tax credits that millions rely on to pay for health coverage, in exchange for an inadequate flat tax credit that leaves working families totally exposed to premium increases.   Families who do not lose coverage altogether under the GOP plan will have fewer protections, including those that safeguard seniors and people with pre-existing conditions against discrimination. Indeed, CBO notes in its readout that the GOP bill would allow insurers to ‘substantially’ increase premiums for older Americans.   In short – under the Republican plan, Americans will be paying more and getting less.

It seeks to dismantle President Obama’s efforts to combat climate change in the name of bringing back coal and other dirty-energy jobs. This effort rests on a false premise and threatens the health and security of the American people.  Coal mining jobs are not disappearing because of regulations. They are disappearing because natural gas is cheap, wind and solar are booming, and automation has allowed coal companies to produce more fuel with fewer employees. Clean energy jobs across the country outnumber fossil fuel jobs by more than 2.5 to 1. Solar and wind jobs are growing at a rate 12 times faster than the rest of the U.S. economy. But this executive order, much like the President’s proposed budget, is a job-killer that throws obstacles in the way of innovation and job creation in the renewable industry in favor of sweetheart deals for fossil fuels.  Repeal of the Clean Power Plan, which aims to slash greenhouse gas emission from electricity by 32 percent by 2030, will lead to billions of additional tons of carbon being released into the atmosphere contributing to hundreds of thousands of premature deaths.    The Department of Defense has viewed climate change as a national security concern for at least a decade, and ignoring it threatens our military installations and infrastructure, while raising the potential for increased conflict across the globe.

Following such resounding opposition from the American people, one would think that the Republican Majority might end its senseless crusade against the Affordable Care Act and, at long last, work with Democrats to improve the ACA and build on its progress.   Sadly, that was not the case.   Today, House Republicans successfully voted to strip health care away from millions of Americans, raise costs for working families and seniors, and put insurance companies back in charge of health care decisions – contrary to everything the President said he would do.   The version of Trumpcare that passed today is, shockingly, even worse than its predecessor: it guts protections for those with preexisting conditions, allowing insurers to once again discriminate against people based on their health status. It lets states eliminate essential health benefits, resulting in paltry plans that cover very little. And it gives insurers free rein to levy an unlimited ‘age tax’ on older Americans.   In a pathetic attempt to placate worried constituents, Republicans added $8 billion to their plan at the last minute to help cover those with pre-existing conditions. But estimates suggest that this eleventh-hour addition constitutes a mere fraction of what’s needed. No matter what the Republicans say, millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions are still left without the protections they need under Trumpcare. This change is too little, too late.   Now, there are no illusions regarding the GOP’s answer to the Affordable Care Act, which they criticized and voted to repeal repeatedly for seven years.  Their plan is simple: pay more and get less.  Not an appealing alternative.  How anyone can claim to be a ""compassionate conservative"" while actively working to take health care away from another human being – and for a political end, no less – is beyond me.

This proposal—save for the very rich—does not discriminate in who it hurts. It is disgraceful and, I believe, a total non-starter in Congress.   Here are just some of the harmful cuts President Trump would like to make happen: After the President unambiguously promised not to cut Medicaid, he proposes a $610 billion cut; the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a program to prevent domestic hunger benefiting children and families, would see a $193 billion cut over 10 years; the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, which states and municipalities rely upon for funding local development and infrastructure projects, would be completely eliminated; the HOME program, which creates affordable housing, would be completely eliminated; and the National Institutes of Health would suffer billions of dollars in crippling cuts to research.    But that’s not all. The President is also proposing a 30 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agency, which would include the zeroing out several clean energy and climate change programs. He wants to slash the Education Department by $9.2 billion, or 13 percent, and eliminate programs that serve children, including after-school programs and mental-health services. And he has proposed slashing the State Department by 28 percent, another extreme cut which I find particularly alarming as Ranking Member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.  This all amounts to a devastating assault on every American—our housing, health care, safety, education and environment are all put at risk. It represents a vision for America that is both cruel and unrealistic. We need to come up with a budget that works for the American people, not punishes them.

Out-of-pocket costs will skyrocket. In short – Americans will pay more, and get less.  The report also confirms how dangerous Trumpcare will be for Americans living with pre-existing conditions – a fact the GOP has tried to conceal. CBO finds that, in states that opt out of the Affordable Care Act’s protections, ‘people who are less healthy (including those with preexisting or newly acquired medical conditions) would ultimately be unable to purchase comprehensive nongroup health insurance at premiums comparable to those under current law, if they could purchase it at all.’  The gravity of this report underscores just how irresponsible my Republican colleagues were to vote on Trumpcare without knowing the extent of its effects.

Among other deficiencies, these reports uncovered weakly encrypted wifi networks at Mar-a-Lago, unsuitable for protecting vital information.  Because of this, I penned a letter signed by 23 of my House colleagues to White House Counsel Donald McGahn calling for immediate action to rectify this security risk.   Text of the letter can be found below:  June 7, 2017  The Honorable Donald McGahn  Counsel to the President  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW  Washington, DC 20500  Dear Mr. McGahn:  Recent reports have highlighted serious network vulnerabilities at several Trump properties including and especially the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida.[1]  In light of these reports, we write to urge you to take all necessary steps to immediately secure the networks at Mar-a-Lago, and at the President’s other personal properties where he plans to execute the Office of the President of the United States.  Cybersecurity experts noted that these vulnerabilities “could be used to remotely turn on the microphones and cameras of devices connected to the network.”[2]  Cyber-criminals and nation states have both the incentive and the ability to hack these networks to obtain sensitive information critical to our national security and international diplomacy.  To leave these networks unsecured undermines our national priorities and the trust the American people place in the Office of the President.  Since taking office in January, the President has spent a substantial amount of time at Mar-a-Lago and has even hosted several foreign leaders there.[3]  The President has openly strategized and discussed national security issues on the club’s open-air terrace.[4]  Much of the information transmitted to Mar-a-Lago, and the President’s communications while there, are undoubtedly as sensitive as the information and communications that pass through the White House.  Recent reporting by ProPublica and Gizmodo unfortunately brought to light many cyber vulnerabilities that raise questions about the security of information at the retreat.  This reporting found unsecured printers on the premises of the resort.  Notably, a single unsecured wireless printer can create a back door within a network, creating a full network-wide vulnerability.[5]  More generally, unsecured wireless printers can also allow unauthorized persons to intercept sensitive information.[6]  To address these problems, the Defense Information Systems Agency requires military facilities to disable all wireless printing features.[7]  Reporting also uncovered a weakly encrypted Wi-Fi network at Mar-a-Lago.  The network in question uses a form of encryption that security researchers, for more than a decade, have found unsuitable for protecting sensitive information.[8]  Indeed, the U.S. Army prohibits the use of this weak form of encryption.  In the Army’s Information Assurance Best Business Practice guide, the Army’s chief information officer notes that this form of encryption has “fundamental flaws that allow for the rapid compromise of the encryption using readily available tools.”[9]  Finally, reporting also demonstrated Mar-a-Lago’s public facing website included unencrypted login pages to back-end databases containing sensitive information.[10]  Similarly, cyber authorities note that logging into a server remotely with an unencrypted protocol is a major risk.[11]  Until these vulnerabilities are addressed, we are concerned that sensitive or even classified information could be readily accessible to cyber criminals or nation states.  While the Government Accountability Office is currently investigating this matter,[12] the White House must act immediately to secure the potentially sensitive information on these systems.  Cybersecurity experts note that the data on these networks may already be stolen and the systems may already be compromised.[13]  Time is of the essence, and we urge your office to take immediate action.  The risks are too high, and these vulnerabilities are too glaring to wait.  Sincerely,  Eliot L. Engel; Mike Doyle; Brendan F. Boyle; Yvette D. Clarke; Diana DeGette; Anna G.

North Korea's current course is unacceptable but the costs of miscalculation on our part are also considerable. I urge the President to exercise caution as he considers possible responses to this North Korean provocation and to remain closely coordinated with our allies so we avoid the unthinkable human cost of another military intervention on the Korean Peninsula.  Unfortunately, the President has not yet learned what many of us have long known: complex foreign policy issues do not get solved overnight. China will not change its perception of its own strategic interests just because of the force of the President's personality. It is naïve and short-sighted to think that a long-standing, dangerous problem can be addressed without a serious strategy and the determination to see it though. Though the United States cannot outsource this challenge to Beijing, we must find a way to work with China—the country with the most influence over the North Korean regime—to solve this challenge.

It is a signal to the millions of Americans who owe their health to the protections and coverage provided by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that our voices will be heard. This debate should never have been about the politics of ‘winning.’ A White House victory doesn’t always translate into an American victory. There is no victory in denying health care to millions of Americans—whether its 22 million, or 32 million, or 16 million, depending on which half-baked bill we’re talking about. The victory is in protecting millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes, or cancer, and preventing women from being charged more just for being women. It is about health care in the world’s greatest democracy being a right, not a privilege for the few.   I applaud not only my Democratic colleagues, but also the three Republican Senators who refused to vote for a bill they knew would hurt their constituents. They adhered to their principles and deserve our gratitude.    Today, we take solace in Trumpcare’s failure. But, tomorrow, we continue to fight.

Trumpcare had zero. What’s more – the final GOP bill wasn’t released until just before the vote. After years of decrying what they claimed was an opaque and rushed process around the ACA, Republicans barely allowed time to let the ink dry on their final bill before voting on it – much less fully understand what they were voting on.   Let’s not stamp our feet and take our toys home because commonsense prevailed. Instead, let’s abandon this closed-door approach to governing.

In the meeting we made clear that the type of service our constituents continue to endure is unacceptable, and the response from postal officials has been inadequate. We were told by Mr. Stroman that steps are being taken to improve service and that additional resources have been allocated to the area.  We have also been assured by Mr. Stroman that he will return in 30 days to assess the progress that has been made. We hope for positive improvement, but our offices will continue to work with constituents to resolve their complaints. The system is broken, and we were very clear with Mr. Stroman that it needs to be quickly fixed.

Now, just days before the fiscal year ends, they’ve proven only that they were willing to put critical programs on the backburner for a shot at fulfilling their misguided political promises.   Federal funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) expires on September 30th. This program, known in New York as ‘Child Health Plus,’ provides health insurance to more than 600,000 New York children and about 9 million children nationwide. Thankfully, New York has sufficient funds to keep our CHIP program operational past this deadline – but other states face a grimmer reality. 10 states are projected to deplete their CHIP funds by the end of this year, meaning they will soon need to begin the process of shutting their programs down – making the threat of disrupted health coverage very real.   Also expiring September 30th is funding for community health centers. Community health centers, funded by the federal government, serve one-in-thirteen people nationwide. Americans who are uninsured or don’t have a ‘regular doctor’ can turn to community health centers in times of need, rather than the emergency room. This allows patients to avoid unnecessary ER bills and, in turn, saves our health care system billions of dollars. By allowing this deadline to pass, Republicans are putting these centers and their patients in jeopardy. Some will need to end weekend and evening hours, roll back services, or freeze hiring to cope with the funding cliff.   For months, I have urged the Majority to act on these programs. I highlighted the need to extend CHIP and community health center funding during an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing in June. I again pressed the issue in a letter to House Leadership earlier this month. In addition, I am a cosponsor of H.R. 3770, the Community Health Investment, Modernization and Excellence Act to extend community health center funding. I sincerely hope that Republicans won’t waste any more time before extending these lifelines for our constituents.   Also expiring September 30th is the Perkins Loan Program. Perkins Loans are federal loans provided to low income students to make higher education more affordable. Students throughout this country rely on these funds to pursue their dreams of higher education. Unfortunately, beginning October 1, no new Perkins Loans will be disbursed and billions of dollars in student aid will be eliminated from schools’ revolving funds. This jeopardizes the future of the 50,000 New York students who have already begun their fall semesters.   The Perkins Loan Program is too important to New Yorkers to let lapse. I am a cosponsor of H.R. 2482, the Perkins Loan Extension Act and this week I called on House leadership to reauthorize this critical program. Sadly, those in leadership have failed to act.  These are programs that protect Americans, improve affordability, and expand access to critical, life-saving care. It is shameful that, just days before the end of the fiscal year, Republicans have put so many people in jeopardy.","status",NA,NA,40,3,0,0,0,0,0,0

Per the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), ending them will cause premiums to rise and spur insurers to leave markets, in turn leaving Americans with fewer choices – the exact opposite of what the President has promised for months.   If the President truly believed that action was needed on Congress’s part, he would have called on Congress to act. I have cosponsored the Marketplace Certainty Act, along with dozens of my colleagues, to appropriate funding for the cost-sharing reduction payments and remove any ambiguity on this issue. But, instead, the President chose to put millions of Americans’ health care at risk.   Just yesterday, the President signed an Executive Order that could bring back the junk insurance policies that, before the ACA, offered little value for your money and punished sick people for their health status. Now, he’s doubled-down with a move that will hike up premiums and limit consumer choice. All of this amounts to the same ‘pay more, get less’ plan that the American people rejected in Trumpcare.

Seniors should be able to count on a reasonable COLA and have peace of mind that they’ll be able to make ends meet from year to year.    This is a fixable problem. COLAs are tied to a measure of inflation called the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). This index doesn’t adequately measure the types of costs older Americans usually face. Seniors have unique spending habits, usually spending less on travel and gasoline and more on medication and housing than younger cohorts. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks an alternative index, the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E), which specifically accounts for seniors’ typical expenses to measure inflation. Using the CPI-E would allow the government to more accurately base COLAs on the true living costs that seniors face. What’s more, the CPI-E regularly determines a greater cost-of-living increase than the CPI-W.   That is why I have introduced the Guaranteed 3% COLA for Seniors Act, which requires the use of the more appropriate CPI-E to determine annual COLAs. In addition, my bill would ensure seniors receive at least a 3% COLA every year, even if the CPI-E COLA falls below this amount.    Our current system forces seniors to live in fear of paltry COLAs that won’t meet their needs. I will continue pushing to fix this problem and afford seniors the raises they deserve.","status",NA,NA,38,4,1,0,0,0,0,0

We will not successfully combat the opioid epidemic if Republicans continue their crusade against the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Prior to the ACA, more than a third of individual market policies did not cover substance use treatment. Now, thanks to the ACA, coverage of that treatment is guaranteed. Republicans’ ACA repeal bills would have also ended the Medicaid expansion and cut more than $800 billion from the Medicaid program, which has been a lifeline in affording people with substance use disorders access to treatment.   On top of sabotaging the ACA, Republicans have allowed funding for community health centers and the Children’s Health Insurance Program run dry, allowed cuts to safety net hospitals, and repeatedly failed to allot the funding needed to tackle this emergency head-on. While this declaration is positive, without additional funds to aid medical facilities that are already facing severe Republican cuts, it will not be enough to make a real impact.

Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, but fewer Americans are smoking and lung cancer rates are declining. Still, the disease is the number one cause of cancer death. About 220,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer in the U.S. each year, and more than 155,000 men and women are expected to die of the disease each year.   The biggest way to reduce your risk of lung cancer is to never smoke, or if you do smoke, quit. Smoking is responsible for about 80 percent of lung cancer cases in the U.S. In addition to cigarettes, smoking cigars, pipes, hookah or other tobacco products is harmful. The effects of e-cigarettes on cancer risk are not yet known, so they should not be considered a safe alternative or cessation tool until more research is done.  Although smoking is the main risk factor for lung cancer, secondhand smoke, exposure to radon gas, or occupational exposure to certain toxic substances or radiation may also increase your risk.   Lung cancer symptoms, including a persistent cough, constant chest pain, hoarseness lasting a long time or shortness of breath, don’t usually occur until the disease has progressed. If you are or were a long-time smoker, talk to a health care professional about the pros and cons of low-dose spiral CT screening, which can detect lung cancer at earlier stages, when successful treatment is more likely.   Quitting smoking is not easy due to the highly addictive nicotine found in cigarettes. A health care professional can connect you to resources to help you quit.

In my remarks, I mentioned how someone near and dear to me once said the Republican Party is the party of rich men and women, and the Democratic Party is the party of working men and women. Nothing proves that more than this tax bill scam today.  The tax bill the GOP just passed, without a single Democratic vote, is one of the worst bills I have ever seen brought to the floor of the House. It raises taxes on millions of middle-class families, eliminates key deductions for state and local income and sales tax, and adds trillions to the debt. All this to give tax cuts to America’s wealthiest families and corporations. This bill will also decimate Medicaid and Medicare, which in turn will create new deficits for these programs, leading to more calls from the right for their privatization.  New York already sends more money to Washington than it gets back. Residents in New York rely heavily on state and local income and sales tax deductions to level the playing field and provide extra tax relief. These deductions don’t just help the wealthy—they allow folks in the middle class to reduce their tax burden, own homes, and increase their purchasing power. But, if this tax plan becomes law, those deductions would either be eliminated completely or heavily reduced, and New Yorkers would be devastated.  In addition, the process by which this bill was written was just as disappointing as the final product. House Republicans once again took to writing a huge piece of legislation behind closed doors, without any input from Democrats. And considering what this bill will do to explode the deficit, I’m not sure how any House Republican who voted in favor if it can call themselves ‘fiscally responsible.’  Thanks to this bill, the middle-class will be directly paying for an upper-class and big corporation tax cut. No fair minded elected official could support that. Hopefully the Senate will scrap this disaster so we can go back to the drawing board and write a bill that treats middle-class taxpayers fairly.  https://engel.house.gov/latest-news1/engel-gop-tax-plan-a-scam-disastrous-for-new-yorkers/","link","https://engel.house.gov/latest-news1/engel-gop-tax-plan-a-scam-disastrous-for-new-yorkers/","engel.house.gov",79,13,2,0,0,1,0,0

This is exactly what opponents of the Keystone XL pipeline have long feared. Is it any wonder why folks who live near the pipeline are concerned about its possible effects to their water supply?   I implore the Public Service Commission in Nebraska to deny TransCanada’s permit to complete construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.

Today’s reporting not only confirms those suspicions, but indicates their plan is about as bad as it can get.   Net neutrality is a critical protection for consumers, one that prevents Internet Service Providers (ISP) from charging extra for certain websites and data usage. Without net neutrality, an ISP could decide to institute a tiered system for your internet access, blocking websites like Netflix and forcing you to pay extra to use them. Repealing net neutrality rules would also allow those same ISP’s to throttle—or slow down—your internet access if it suits them, or offer other consumers who are willing to pay more priority access to certain parts of the web. Clearly, this would be harmful to consumers. This proposal would also limit innovation, reduce competition among ISPs, and make the internet a less open place.  Millions of people across the country have spoken out against repealing net neutrality, but the FCC, Chairman Pai, and the Trump Administration have chosen to ignore what the American people want. This cannot stand. We must preserve net neutrality now, and for future generations.","status",NA,NA,125,16,10,0,0,2,0,11

Gun violence is a national crisis, and we cannot let another year go by without a response. It is long past time that Congress pass legislation to address the gun violence epidemic in our country.

I believe we should not end the year without enacting a solution for the hundreds of thousands of young people who had their immigration status so cruelly revoked by the President in September. Every day, another 122 DREAMers lose their protected status and are at risk of deportation. Yet, despite bipartisan support, this bill does not include a fix for DACA.  We also should not have ended the year without fixing the mess House Republicans made when they allowed funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to expire. This CR fails our nation’s children, putting an inadequate patch on CHIP instead of a long-term, bipartisan reauthorization. This won’t help states plan and it won’t give CHIP families peace of mind.  On top of that, this CR fails to provide adequate funding to care for our nation’s veterans. The VA is facing a dire shortfall and a shortage of 45,000 doctors, nurses and health care providers. It is unconscionable of GOP leaders not to authorize these funds and deny care to veterans.  Finally, the House also voted today on a supplemental disaster relief package – but one that doesn’t sufficiently meet the needs of fellow Americans in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
