Lois Frankel","2017-10-27","2017-10-27 13:42:05","Today at the UN Security Council an important debate is taking place: women’s involvement in peace negotiations on the world stage. Right now, tens of millions of women and girls have been displaced from their homes, and countless more are subject to unspeakable violence. Yet, UN peacekeepers are nearly all male, and most peace agreements make no mention of women— effectively silencing women’s voices and overlooking their rights. Studies show that when women have a seat at the table, the prospect that conflict prevention and resolution will succeed rise significantly. This, in turn, benefits our own national security. I am proud to have voted earlier this month for the Women, Peace and Security Act. Let’s build on this progress at the UN today by voicing our commitment to ensuring women’s equal participation in peacemaking. Their futures depend on it.","link","http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/women-peace-security","unwomen.org",26,15,3,2,0,0,1,1
