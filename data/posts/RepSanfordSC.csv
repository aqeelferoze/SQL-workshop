The changes weakening the Office of Congressional Ethics were removed from the congressional rules package.  This is an important victory for the kind of independent review that is vital to good government. What occurred around lunchtime today is a reminder to all of us of the importance of making our voice heard. Our office received lots of calls, and in speaking to other Members on the floor, I heard their offices did too. It’s indeed the squeaky wheels that get grease in politics, and this was the effect of those calls and emails this morning.  As I said earlier today, self-policing and enforcement on ethics matters does not work. I fought to this end for eight years during my governorship in South Carolina, given the legislative body there depends on self enforcement on ethics matters. Had this provision been a part of today’s rules package, it would have represented a step backward on ethics reform in Washington.","status",NA,NA,262,45,42,12,2,1,0,0

The start of each new Congress represents much hope and the opportunities that come with it. Yesterday, the first day, was a real mix of awe and bewilderment by new Members - and reflection by those of us who have been around a term or two. As we’re sworn in en masse, there is a blend of faces that you never see for the remaining two years of the Congress, given Members can bring with them their children to the House floor on this one day.   As we were sworn in yesterday afternoon, I was struck by the honor it represents to try the best I can to represent the 750,000 people that make up the First District of South Carolina. Accordingly, I just wanted to say thank you. It’s an honor indeed.  The times have never been more significant. We really are at a tipping point with regard to the debt, deficit, and government spending and what will come next in how these things shape the trajectory of our civilization. I appreciate the chance to work on these issues and others.  It’s also a big deal because this miracle of self governance is perpetuated by solemn votes cast and belief in the system that the Founding Fathers created. To stand as a part of the body that greeted people like George Washington or Thomas Jefferson or who had as a Member someone like Abraham Lincoln or John Quincy Adams is indeed a blessing that I thought about on the House floor yesterday.  So, the bottom line is thank you. I will continue to try hard.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/photos/a.124615434414913.1073741828.118387985037658/599026686973783/?type=3",NA,259,46,13,15,0,0,0,2

It would allow Congress to review and cancel regulations approved in the final months of the Obama administration all in one fell swoop...instead of one by one.   Since November, the Obama administration has put out dozens of regulations costing an estimated $44.1 billion, which doesn't even include the cost of regulations that are still in the works. Given this rapid output of regulations touching everything from ceiling fans to gas furnaces, there is an obvious need for this legislation from both a financial and a constitutional standpoint. This legislation is an attempt to cut costs and restore the power that properly belongs to the legislative branch.    The House did pass this same legislation this past November, but there was no chance that it would become law given that President Obama was not going to sign something that would overturn the very regulations it put in place. President-elect Donald Trump has committed to reducing regulatory burdens, and this legislation will help him to do just that.   For a few more details, I’m sharing my vote explanation from November here.","link","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/posts/577720802437705","facebook.com",397,47,0,19,6,2,0,4

The House measure passed by a bipartisan vote of 342 to 80, and I voted in favor of it.   Israel’s policy with regard to settlements on the West Bank is worthy of debate, but that is not what we got with the UN resolution and the Obama administration’s unilateral and unprecedented lame duck action.   To me, this is what this vote was all about: should an outgoing administration make major reversals in U.S. policy during the lame duck session when there is no voter accountability with regard to their actions - and the voters have clearly signaled they want a change of course? Yet President Obama did just that when the United States abstained - rather than vetoed - for the first time since 1995 a Security Council resolution of this nature.   Secondly, H.Res. 11 was also about reasserting congressional authority. It needs to be done on every sphere of government, and this includes foreign policy.   For decades, the executive branch and regulatory agencies have vastly expanded its reach into both domestic and foreign affairs at the expense of Congress. The Founding Fathers never intended for a king or imperial rule. Congress was to be separate but co-equal area of government. In this instance, when the Obama administration abstained, they ignored a measure passed by the House last November stating it is U.S. policy to veto UN resolutions that Congress viewed as one-sided against Israel. In an instance like this, when Congress has made its view clear and is responsible for the funding entailed in related decisions...it’s imperative that Congress speak up and assert it authority. Though it can’t undo the president’s action, that’s what this vote did - which is important in the international community’s assessment of whether or not the president’s view really reflects the American view on this issue.","status",NA,NA,194,29,29,4,0,2,2,0

I am a cosponsor of this bill, and it passed 237 to 187 with my vote.   The bill would require all new, “major rules” - meaning those rules that have an annual, estimated impact of $100 million or more - to be voted on by Congress and signed into law by the president before they go into effect. If Congress does not approve a proposed rule within 70 days, then it would be automatically rejected.  This was how the Founding Fathers intended the branches to work. They gave Congress the power to make laws and the executive branch the power to enforce them, but today I’d argue that the Founding Fathers would hardly recognize our federal government.   The recent creation and expansion of executive agencies, commonly called the “fourth branch,” is astounding. For most of the first hundred years of the United States’ existence, the only executive agencies were the Departments of War, State, Navy, and Treasury and the Office of the Attorney General. Today, there are over one hundred agencies writing rules and regulations that have the effect of law.   The extent to which the Obama administration has overstepped its constitutional power and usurped congressional legislative authority is staggering. The result? Over the past seven years and a half years, the Obama administration imposed a total of 20,641 regulations. Of these, 600 were deemed “major rules,” and according to Doug Holtz-Eakin, the former Director of the Congressional Budget Office, these rules cost taxpayers a total of $745 billion dollars.  While other administrations have issued executive orders and finalized major agency rules, the content and cost of those issued by President Obama are unprecedented. In George W. Bush’s last term, his administration finalized 268 agency rules, costing a total of $149 billion dollars.  Between 2009 and 2016, the Obama administration’s finalized rules cost taxpayers $750 billion...five times more than the former president.  Some people have a level of concern regarding the impact that the REINS Act might have on federal agencies’ ability to issue rules that protect natural resources and the environment. I believe these concerns to be unwarranted. Requiring Congress to be more involved in the rulemaking process does not change Congress’s ability to listen to what people are saying about the environment - it just moves us from unilateral executive branch authority.   With a new president being inaugurated in just 15 days, this legislation would help restore the balance of power outlined by the Constitution and help ensure future presidential administrations work with Congress and not around it. For these reasons, I voted for this bill.","status",NA,NA,208,37,46,10,0,0,0,0

For instance, traffic here locally has gone from bad to worse.   This isn’t unexpected. However, there is a lot of new in Charleston. As our city continues to grow with massive influxes of people, the natural settings that are part of what makes this area so desirable starts to shrink. Indeed, big cities seem to capture you. In a sense, it becomes harder and harder to get out, and I think that the congestion we’re seeing is indeed a sign of our own growth. Unfortunately, this makes what used to be a quick drive out to the country that much tougher on a Friday afternoon.  It’s for that reason the great cities of the world have been deliberate about capturing parts of their countryside and incorporating them into the tapestry that makes a town. Think about it. All the great cities have parks of scale. New York has 843 acres in the middle of Manhattan. Sydney, Australia has over 1,000 acres on the water. London and Paris both have about 5,000 acres downtown, while Stockholm has over 6,000 acres. I could go on, but the point here is simple: planning these parks took foresight...and they add tremendously to people’s quality of life.   While a good deal of my time will be wrapped up in Washington - the 115th Congress officially kicked-off last week, I’ve an idea in this regard. We have the perfect place for such a park in Charleston, and I’d ask for your help.  There are 1,300 acres you and I already own through the Ports Authority on the tip of Daniel Island. And if the 400 acres along the Wando River were preserved, both you and I would have something special. It faces south and is thereby blessed with the afternoon breeze so essential to summertime enjoyment. It would be accessible by water taxi from downtown or Mount Pleasant, an important feature in dealing with the traffic headed our way.  It’s even been started already.  The state House and Senate have already secured 50 acres for our state parks system at the very tip of the peninsula for park use, but each one of us can work to make it happen. If you want to get involved, call my Charleston office at (843) 352-7572. Alternatively, email me at mark.sanford@mail.house.gov. This way, 100 years from now when Charleston looks far different than today, there will be a green oasis in the middle of our metropolitan area that offers a touch of what has attracted so many of us to call the Lowcountry home.

I voted for the bill, and it passed 238 to 183. This bill, along with the REINS Act and Midnight Rules Act passed last week, would help get our government closer to the three balanced and separate branches of government envisioned by our Founding Fathers. Allow me to explain a few of the main things this bill does to try to regain the balance they intended.   First, the bill would require agencies set forth the least costly alternative to achieve the same objectives of a proposed rule. For an agency to choose higher cost alternatives, the agency must show Congress how the more expensive option would better benefit public safety, health, and welfare. This section of the bill is important because the cost of complying with current federal regulations is already estimated at $1.86 trillion annually - a silent tax of about $15,000 for every American household every year.  Second, the bill would stop federal courts from giving too much power to agencies when it comes to interpreting laws created by Congress. Over the past few decades, courts have started a doctrine where they simply defer to agencies when there is a question as to the exact requirements of a law, even if Congress itself disagrees. This allows executive agencies to usurp the power of the judiciary and legislature. This portion of the bill would require federal courts to do their job and interpret the law without deferring to agencies.   Third, the bill would require federal agencies to consider the potential economic impact that proposed regulations would have on small businesses. Far too often, bureaucrats in the “Washington bubble” don’t understand the burden these rules can impose on small businesses - the money, time, and manpower it takes to comply with these regulations. There are over 28 million small businesses in the United States, and they collectively provide jobs for over 55 percent of the American workforce. Requiring agencies to stop and think about the economic impact these rules have on small businesses will hopefully make federal departments more aware of the economic consequences of their presumably well-intended actions.    While most of this bill does a fine job scaling back executive overreach and the burdens imposed by agency regulations, I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a perfect bill, and this piece of legislation is no exception. One part of the bill would delay any regulation with a potential cost of $1 billion until any lawsuit against it is over. On its face, this seems like a great idea. High cost regulations should receive greater scrutiny. That was the whole basis for the REINS Act I cosponsored and voted in favor of last week. But, I think the way in which this portion of the bill provides that scrutiny is flawed. Rather than giving Congress the opportunity to take a second look at high cost regulations, it gives this power to plaintiffs’ attorneys. I feel fairly confident that is not what the Founding Fathers intended, and this aspect could pose huge problems if Trump tries to reform our immigration system. I voted against this specific proposal when it came up as its own bill in the 114th Congress, and I explained that vote in greater length back in September.   In the whole, I do think this bill will help slow the growing powers of the executive branch and help restore the balance of powers among the three branches of the federal government intended by the Framers of the Constitution. Accordingly, I voted yes.","status",NA,NA,58,22,10,3,0,2,1,2

This is a fairly straight-forward regulatory accountability bill specific to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which had its authority to regulate securities markets greatly expanded under Dodd-Frank. Essentially, it brings the SEC into compliance with President Obama’s Executive Order 13563, issued in January 2011, which reaffirmed requirements that agencies conduct a cost-benefit analysis of regulatory proposals with public participation.  The bill would direct the SEC to consider whether a proposed rulemaking would promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation while imposing the minimum burden possible. It would also require the Commission to assess which regulatory approach would most benefit society, including the approach of not regulating at all.","status",NA,NA,34,16,4,0,0,1,2,3

But as is the case with all dreams, they are works in progress. The tragedy of what occurred at Mother Emanuel AME Church is a reminder of the degree to which there is still work to be done in fulfilling the dream of Dr. King.   On the other hand, the response of the victims’ families and the response of the Charleston community at large was inspirational for the way that it spoke to how far we have come in some respects to living in line with the ideals of Dr. King.  I think the picture below that was captured a few days after the tragedy is a visible reminder of what we’re all seeking to memorialize and live in honoring the dream and life of Dr. King. It’s a reminder of how far we’ve come and still how far we have to go.

I voted in favor of this bill, and it passed by a vote of 227 to 198. Allow me to explain the three main reasons why I ultimately voted in favor of it.   First, it’s the only vehicle we have to repeal Obamacare. In a nutshell, the bill passed today orders legislation repealing Obamacare, and that legislation can pass the Senate with a standard majority vote. This is important, given that the Senate has 52 Republicans...not the 60 needed to stop a filibuster, which is the biggest hurdle to getting legislation through the Senate.  Second, while well intended, Obamacare did not do as promised and, as a consequence, needs to be repealed. It has failed at many levels. It was President Obama that promised in  2008 to lower annual premiums by $2,500 for a typical family. Today, the opposite is true, and premiums are on the rise all across the country. Nationally, premiums are up 25% on average, and it’s even worse in South Carolina where people are facing 29% increases.   This shouldn’t be a surprise, considering providers keep leaving the marketplace reducing cost-cutting competition. In South Carolina, only one provider is left operating in the state. Despite shrinking choices and rising premiums, Obamacare imposes fines on Americans if they don’t have health insurance - penalties that range from $2,085 to 2.5% of yearly income.   On that note, repealing Obamacare is also about restoring individual choice and personal freedom. When Obamacare was signed into law about six years ago, it marked the first time in our history that the federal government forced citizens to purchase a private product. This was a bad precedent in 2010, and it is even more frightening when you take into account the growing cost the law has on people around the country.  Third, Congress will address the budget this spring. If I believed the budget numbers in this budget vehicle were to prevail, I would vote against it. But they won’t - this bill simply allows for the start of the Obamacare repeal process.   Since 2010, Congress has voted over 50 times to repeal all or parts of the law.

I voted in favor of the bill, and it passed by a vote of 268 to 151.   The waiting period, originally ten years long, became law in 1947 with the idea that having a civilian in charge of the Department of Defense would protect against the military growing stronger than the people it protects. The idea of civilian control goes back to the early days of our republic when George Washington gave up his military rank upon becoming president.   Three years after the waiting period was signed into law, Congress voted to issue a waiver allowing General George Marshall to serve as Secretary of Defense, even though he hadn’t yet retired from the Army. General Marshall had a record of success as a commander during World War II and as a diplomat in the years immediately following the war. President Truman nominated Marshall to the post to help turn things around, and in 1950, Congress granted a waiver for Marshall to serve as Secretary of Defense. This was the first and only time a waiver has been granted since it went into effect.   I have always believed in the notion of civilian control of the military. It is paramount, and the question we have to ask ourselves is whether or not we believe the Mattis waiver would jeopardize this.   At many levels, I do not believe it would.   By all accounts, General Mattis is a deeply philosophical man. His nickname is the “Warrior Monk” - in part, because of his knowledge of military history and strategy but also due to his demeanor. He is known for his bias in spending time directly with enlisted soldiers, and given the sacrifices they make, I think there is wisdom in having someone focused on the life and pressures of the everyday soldier.   I think there is also wisdom in not having a personality that says shoot first and ask questions later. It is Mattis who has observed that, “by reading, you learn through others’ experiences, generally a better way to do business, which is especially important in our line of work where the consequences of incompetence are so final for young men.”  We live in tumultuous times. There are emerging new threats to our nation. As we face a variety of power centers around the world rather than single source of opposing power, we have a challenged force structure and a president with no prior military or political experience - and I think all these things contribute to making this proposed waiver a warranted one.","status",NA,NA,155,20,12,5,1,1,0,0

The call was a simple, yet important step in the two-way communication that’s vital to representative government. Indeed, one of the most pronounced messages sent was that many were concerned with what happens next with regard to healthcare.   In that vein, I joined with Dr. Phil Roe and several of my colleagues from the Republican Study Committee (RSC) a few weeks ago to introduce the American Health Care Reform Act of 2017, which fully repeals and - just as important - fully replaces Obamacare.   My point in raising this is that it's yet another example of some of the concepts that will be advanced in what comes next in a replacement bill. The House has moved over the last few weeks from simply repeal...to repeal and replace based on so many making their voices heard - as they did last night on this issue.  The Department of Health and Human Services projects that premiums for insurance plans purchased through Obamacare exchanges will rise by 29% in South Carolina this year. To put these rising healthcare costs in context, keep in mind that real household income is down by 21% since 2000.  Here are some highlights of what the Republican Study Committee plan does:  1.  Fully repeals Obamacare on January 1, 2018.  2.  Replaces the tax exemption for employer-sponsored health insurance plans with a health insurance deduction of $7,500 for individuals or $20,500 for families. This deduction would apply to both income and payroll taxes and would be indexed to increase with inflation. In other words, healthcare coverage would become more affordable and less tied to your job.   3.  Expands access to tax-free personal Health Savings Accounts (HSA’s) with higher contribution limits. HSA’s empower patients to shop around and compare prices. No one spends your dollars as wisely and effectively as you do. 4.  Creates high-risk pools at the state level for the chronically ill. These premiums would be capped at 200% of the average premium for non-high-risk insurance in each state. 5.  Guarantees individuals with pre-existing conditions can move between health insurance markets, allowing for continuous coverage. 6.  Allows all Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines and makes insurance companies compete for your business nationally. The Constitution gives Congress the responsibility to “regulate commerce...among the several States.”  7.  Allows small businesses to join together to negotiate for more affordable insurance rates just like big corporations do. 8.  Extends federal antitrust laws to health insurance companies. This will help protect competition and, ultimately, consumer prices.  9.  Reforms medical malpractice to limit frivolous litigation and massive payouts for trial lawyers. Medical malpractice lawsuits cost doctors and insurance companies as much as $300 billion each year.   The larger notion here is that we have not yet given free markets an opportunity to work. Indeed, patient-centered, consumer-driven competition is the only way we can lower costs and increase access to America’s healthcare system.","link","http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/04/rsc-rolls-out-plan-to-repeal-and-replace-obamacare/","dailycaller.com",108,58,30,1,0,0,5,6

This represents the third time I have voted on this bill since 2013, and it passed 233 to 187.  This issue is polarizing, with people on both sides of the argument holding viewpoints very strongly. So, I would begin in agreeing on the difficulty of this subject and recognize that it is difficult if not impossible to change opinions and views. I would simply say that the position I have come to hold has been based on much thought and reflection that came after the birth of our boys. I respect the fact that people’s personal experiences may have brought them to a very different conclusion on when life begins or in who should make decisions about its destiny, but on this vote I think one has to vote one’s conscience and this is mine.   Given the degree to which this issue has people in our district on both sides, it strikes me as reasonable to prohibit any federal funds to be used to cover costs for abortion.

Since then, I’ve voted to allow this pipeline four times, and I’m pleased to see this step toward getting it moving again.  It’s often a difficult process finding the right balance between environmental stewardship, which I strongly believe in, and the energy needs of our country. I strongly fought offshore drilling here at home because I didn't think it struck the right balance. On the Keystone XL Pipeline, the equation is different. Canada has committed to extracting these resources. The question now is how will those resources be moved to being refined. Overwhelmingly, pipelines are the safest method of transporting energy resources. This not only means fewer truck or train derailments, and the environmental damage that comes with it, but less energy and emission used in getting things moved. And I think that should matter to all of us, whether we consider ourselves pro-energy, pro-environment...or both.  https://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/Pipeline_safety.jpg","status",NA,NA,179,65,20,8,0,2,1,25

So, it’s a tough lift, but I believe a vital one.   I say this in part because the larger issue here is that there seems to be a direct correlation between length of time in office and a propensity to spend federal dollars. Term-limited lawmakers would be more likely to see a big number as a big number...and by extension look out for the longer-range financial interests of our country.

It's telling for the way that in all the uproar over the last few days that has followed the President’s executive order on extreme vetting for refugees from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, for me, it underscores a couple of truths I tell my boys.  Sometimes it’s not what you say, but how you say it.  The right idea poorly implemented can come across as the wrong idea.  Perceptions are often realities in politics. Because one deals with such large numbers of people, most of whom will never know you personally, all people have to go on are their perceptions…which form the reality of what they believe of you in politics.  So at one level, many supporters of President Trump have told me that they are pleased that he is doing what he said he would do in the campaign. That too few in politics do just that. That more fully vetting refugees from these places identified by the FBI during the Obama administration is not unreasonable.  But what detractors have told me is that they are frightened and scared by the way in which President Trump seems to be going it alone – and that his language is coarse and needlessly confrontational. That one day he seems to be opening conflict with Mexico, the next day with one of our biggest allies, Germany, given Angela Merkel's response to the whole event.  At the heart of their outcry is a belief that we are drifting from two things our country was founded on, one that we are a nation of laws and not men…and two, that in America we judge you not by your ancestry, color, or ethnicity...but by your actions.  Let’s examine both of those thoughts.  One of our country's greatest strengths has been that we have always been seen as predictable - that we are a nation of laws and not men. Our Founding Fathers believed that man could be fickle and subject to whim and that kings and despots well illustrated this. Our system of checks and balances was designed to check this. President Trump hurts himself, scares people, and creates the perception of autocratic tendencies when Congress, and even different departments of the Trump administration itself, are not informed of an imminent change with far-reaching implications like this one.  Under the category of predictable, having MIT or Stanford students detained as they attempt to get back to American universities is not the sort of collateral damage any of us would want to see in maintaining Ronald Reagan's vision of America standing as a shining city on the hill as a beacon of freedom, hope, and opportunity.  On the second point, labeling Mexicans as “rapist and drug lords” or enacting a policy that treats graduate students and green card holders who have long been vetted by our immigration services the same as people who might do us harm strikes many people as wrong.  So, where does that leave me?  It leaves me believing that while we certainly should do more to vet refugees from places that the FBI has identified as points of concern, it should not be done in ways that catch allies around the world, Congress, and American citizens by surprise. I believe President Trump was mistaken in how he implemented this. Randomly stopping people in Dubai on their way back to what they believe is their home - America - leads people to believe the president is acting capriciously and not taking the level of measure they expect in the president.  I’d humbly submit he needs to remember three things. Sometimes it’s not what you say, but how you say it. The right idea poorly implemented can come across as the wrong idea. And that perceptions are often realities in politics.","link","https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4351026%2Fclinton-1995-immigration-sotu","c-span.org",472,149,282,20,11,8,1,2

I’ve had a fair number of conversations with folks at home – over the phone given, I’m in D.C. – and, whether your political leaning is to the left or right, I really have come to believe that his nomination makes great sense. From the right, we believe that a strict interpretation of the Constitution is what the Founding Fathers would have wanted. But from the left, as I’ve talked to folks, the heart of what they really want is the same. They are concerned that Donald Trump will operate outside the law. If that’s the case, wouldn’t you want a strict constructionist rather than a political jurist on the bench? You would want a Court not subject to political pressure and consideration – one that would call it as the law said, not as the person who appointed them would want?   Certainly, there would be issues on which my friends on the left would disagree with Gorsuch. But those things need to be debated and changed by way of the ballot box and the legislative process…not the courts.  For a while now, both political philosophies have wanted to appoint jurists that would take their side and change things by judicial edict rather than the messier and more difficult process of changing law. Gorsuch is a refreshing breath of fresh air in hopefully getting our Supreme Court a step away from judicial activism and a step toward simply interpreting the law, which should be blindfolded and fair to all – whether they are rich or poor, Republican or Democrat.","status",NA,NA,284,51,30,8,0,2,0,5

This is an issue I fought as governor, and we were successful in lessening the impact of the law. But this $17 billion unfunded federal mandate still remains a threat to state budgets and clearly violates the Framers’ understanding of the Tenth Amendment, which says that all powers not given to the federal government are given to the people or the states instead. It also poses serious risks to the security of our personal information. As such, I think it’s still a conversation worth continuing….  The  REAL ID Privacy Protection Act would eliminate the REAL ID program’s most problematic provisions, specifically the ones requiring your sensitive personal documents to be digitally archived for at least a decade in interlinked state databases. These interlinked databases could make it possible for cyber criminals to access your sensitive personal information from any single state database that is part of the REAL ID system. My bill would help protect this information by breaking this dangerous link. Keeping information decentralized is one way to keep information more secure.   Furthermore, the REAL ID Privacy Protection Act will level the playing field by granting a uniform extension of enforcement deadlines to all states currently not in compliance with the current REAL ID law. Thus far, these extensions seem to have been issued on a subjective basis. It has been unclear what criteria have been used to decide which states have been getting extensions, of which deadlines, and for how long. This lack of transparency is unfair to ordinary citizens who simply want to know what they need to do - and by when - in order to board a flight or enter certain federal facilities. It’s also unfair to state legislators trying to map out a route to full compliance.  With these proposed reforms in place, we would be left with a REAL ID program more focused on its core mission of modernizing and securing our state IDs without excessively burdening state budgets, risking the security of our personal information, or violating the Tenth Amendment to our Constitution.  In other words, this bill is designed to solve a problem without creating a host of new ones.

The recent Obama administration regulations are particularly troubling, given that they were enacted in his final months in office, and, in fact 150 of these “midnight” rules were passed after President Trump was elected! They came with a cost of $21 billion in compliance costs - the most of any departing president in over a generation.   In this regard, I recently voted in favor of the REINS Act, which I had already co-sponsored twice, and the Regulatory Accountability Act - two bills that give more power to Congress to oversee executive agency rules.   These bills build upon the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to take a second look at costly regulations recently created by agencies to decide whether they should stand or fall.   Here are a few of last week's votes on regulation:  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Extraction Rule: I voted to repeal this regulation that forces publicly-traded oil and mining companies to disclose all payments to foreign governments. While this may seem like a good way to stop corruption and bribes to foreign governments, that law is already on the books. Unlike China or France or a host of places around the globe, you go to jail in the USA if you do this. So why then does the SEC form its own rule that does the same as current law and only apply it to publicly-traded energy companies? I don’t know, but I do know that change on this front should come from Congress and not a regulatory body.    The Social Security Gun Check Rule: I also voted to repeal another regulation - this one from the Social Security Administration. It requires people whose Social Security benefits are managed by another person be reported to the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System in order to prohibit them from buying or owning a gun. Your son handles your social security paperwork and you lose a constitutionally enshrined right? That's not only unconstitutional, but it gives a sense of how far reaching these government edicts can be - with no due process. Federal law already prohibits people who have been deemed mentally ill by the courts from owning a firearm.   The Blacklisting Rule: I voted to repeal a regulation that requires contractors who bid for federal projects to disclose workplace violations from the past three years from 14 different federal labor laws. This rule could punish companies - not only for convictions of labor law violations, but also for mere allegations. In this country, we live by the notion that you are innocent until proven guilty. This rule turns that principle upside down.   The Flaring Rule: I voted to keep the Bureau of Land Management’s rule requiring oil and gas producers to use new technologies to cut down on the amount of methane they waste through leaks and intentional releases into the air. I voted to uphold this rule because it protects US taxpayers as much as the environment and had been in the works for years. In fact, the Government Accountability Office found in 2010 that taxpayers were losing almost $23 million annually in royalty payments from energy explorations operations on public land because of this practice. Resources that belong to the taxpayers just shouldn’t be wasted.   The Stream Protection Rule:  Finally, about a year ago, I was one of only ten Republicans to vote against the Supporting Transparent Regulatory and Environmental Actions in Mining (STREAM) Act that would have delayed for three years the Department of the Interior’s Stream Protection Rule. This rule regulates mountaintop removal mining in order to protect rivers and streams. I support it because it too had been debated for years, and I believe it strikes the right balance between private property rights and other people’s right to drink clean water. A basic tenet of conservative thought is that my rights extend only to the point where they begin to infringe on yours. Please take a look below at my post from last year if you’re interested in a fuller discussion of this issue...","link","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/posts/462494060627047","facebook.com",47,15,0,0,0,0,0,2

I have two thoughts:   One, though many see her in the most controversial of terms, I believe Mrs. DeVos will do a great job as secretary in advancing educational choices. I applaud the President's decision to nominate her. Today’s system of choice is by zip code or wealth. If you can afford the right house in the right neighborhood, you are assured of a great education for your child. The problem is many can’t, and therefore, the choices that Mrs. DeVos has advocated over the years play straight to enabling not just wealthy or upper-middle income folks to get a great education but for all students. If you missed it, Senator Tim Scott spoke briefly but eloquently in the Senate chamber today on how important this is for parents and students alike.   Two, the Vice President reaffirmed the administration's commitment to both repeal and replace on Obamacare and the tax cut package.

For those of you who didn’t read this piece, it included a link to a Washington Post op-ed that I wrote with regard to a few things I found concerning about Donald Trump’s approach thus far on economic development. Many people somewhat violently disagreed, and that’s worth a brief discussion.  Seeing things differently is what makes the world go round. I love my brothers and sisters, but it doesn’t mean we see everything the same way. In this light, I think it’s important that we find ways to disagree in a civil fashion. That notion of agreeing to disagree - but being humane and civil in the process - is one of the hallmarks of the American experiment.  We are a nation of laws and not men. That’s what our Founding Fathers promised us in the constitutional framework that forms our republic. On this front, I found it concerning that many comments essentially said you just need to get in line with Trump; still others said things to the effect of “you have no right” to raise a question. On the second point, we all have a right to raise a question or offer constructive criticism. That I have failed in a chapter of my life is well chronicled, but to presuppose that one who has failed no longer is entitled to a view is at odds with my faith and the reality of our shared humanity. As to the first point, “just get in line with whatever the President says,” would simply mean one is for a person in politics regardless of the ideas for which that person might stand. I will consistently look for ways to work with our new president on ideas that limit government, maximize individual liberty, and adhere to the balance of power our Founding Fathers created. But where that’s not the case, respectfully disagreeing is what one would expect in a representative republic.   I have credited President Trump on his Supreme Court appointment. Similarly, I have credited him on things like the composition of the cabinet and the repeal of regulations harmful to business. But I don’t think we ever want to get to a spot where you can’t say that we see things differently. I indeed respectfully disagree on him singling out individual companies via Twitter for what harm I think it will ultimately cause in economic development and capital formation. By that same token, I disagree with what he’s beginning to say with regard to spending. His words over the last few days have been, “A balanced budget is fine, but sometimes you have to fuel the well in order to really get the economy going.” That phrase is eerily similar to what President Obama said at the time of the stimulus package. I fought that package for all I was worth when I was governor, not because it was a Democratic idea or Obama’s idea…but because I thought it was a bad idea.   I write because I think that standing for ideas we believe in and opposing those we don’t is something we should all consider, as we think about what comes next in our country and how we make it a more perfect union.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-cant-twitter-shame-his-way-to-economic-growth/2017/01/31/08ca9aea-e6fb-11e6-b82f-687d6e6a3e7c_story.html?utm_term=.3d2278764675","washingtonpost.com",60,48,10,2,0,1,0,5

They weren't debated. They were again just edicts from Washington. As a consequence, Congress again used the Congressional Review Act this week to take a second look at some of those last-minute regulations. Here’s how I voted:   The Land Management Rule: I voted to repeal a Department of the Interior rule that shifts public land use planning away from regional field offices to officials at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Washington. To give you a sense of scope here, the Bureau of Land Management controls about 247 million acres - over 12 times the size of the whole state of South Carolina. My concern is that centralizing control of such vast amounts of land in an office in DC cuts the people who live on, or near, these lands out of the conversation about how the lands will be used. It seems reasonable to me that people with local knowledge should have more of a say about how public lands are used in their own communities...rather than less.   The Teacher Preparation Rule: I also voted to repeal an unfunded federal mandate requiring states to collect data on over 26,000 teacher preparation programs for the Department of Education. This requirement takes up a lot of time and manpower and forces state school boards and local school districts to divert financial resources from the classroom to implementation of Washington’s new requirement. I believe teachers and school boards at the local level have the best understanding of their own communities and the students they serve and are, therefore, better equipped to develop and evaluate their own teacher training programs. The bottom line is that teacher training is a state and local responsibility - and if the Feds want to drive requirements here, they should pay for them.   The State Accountability Rule: Finally, I voted to repeal a rule that weakens the parts of the Every Student Succeeds Act that gave states flexibility with regard to academic achievement standards. Under this rule, states are required to follow rigid federal guidelines defining accountability and improvement. People legitimately see this differently, but the majority of people I have spoken to at home believe education should be driven at a local level not by Washington. Accordingly, I believe these metrics would be better determined by the state and local education agencies that are closer to the parents and students affected.","status",NA,NA,198,43,39,2,0,2,1,1

We discussed a wide range of topics…everything from the Affordable Care Act to immigration and the budget. In the back and forth that ensued, I was struck by the degree to which our part of the world should again be recognized for its civility. People who disagreed 100% with one another were seated across the table, but in the back and forth, people treated one another with respect. In contrast to the town hall meetings of a number of my peers in Congress, this stands out. In this light, there is a picture that hangs in my office in Washington that was taken after the Charleston AME tragedy. In it, there’s a sea of hands holding one another. They are of different shapes, sizes, and colors with an American flag in the background and Charleston Harbor behind.

Trump - whether that entails the question of tax returns or his propensity to use Twitter as a way of shaming companies to do as he sees fit. I think a much better way of growing jobs and capital investment is by creating the right soil conditions for business - which is part of what gets me very enthusiastic about the idea of tax reform.   All this being said, I want to give him credit for appointing Mick Mulvaney as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.   I have long believed that we are walking our way towards a debt crisis, and it’s my hope that Mick’s voice in the White House on debt, deficit, and government spending will be heard. Mick has proven that he’s an equal opportunist when it comes to the need to curtail and control government spending - which we saw demonstrated today when John McCain was a dissenting voice on Mick’s nomination.   While on the category of credit, let me mention two other things:   On the financial front, President Donald J. Trump has frozen non-military and non-security federal hiring until there is a “long-term plan to reduce the size of the Federal Government's workforce.” I hope this holds as we assess where we go next on the budget.  Finally, while Obama was correctly criticized for overstepping his constitutional powers on too many occasions to count, the “pen and phone” can also be used for proper purposes: to enforce existing laws and to undo past executive overreach. For context, Obama set a new record by issuing more than 600 rules, each costing the economy more than $100 million every year. With that as background, President Trump has said his goal is to reduce federal regulations by 75% overall and to eliminate two old ones for each new one. I wish him the best on that important quest….","status",NA,NA,278,150,31,9,1,1,1,1

Here is one for today...the Email Privacy Act.    I am a cosponsor, and it passed the House for a second year in a row just a few weeks ago. This bill actually fits with much of the conversation today surrounding the nomination of General McMaster as the incoming National Security Advisor - namely, what does security look like for each one of us...and how does it balance individual liberty? I believe liberty to be the greatest of keys to real security....  This straightforward bill would require law enforcement to get a search warrant before looking at our private emails - the same standard of privacy our physical mail has always had. The current law, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, was written before email became a part of our daily lives, and it allows the government to access email that’s 180 days old or older...without a warrant.  With Americans now sending at least 40 billion emails per day, only the 509 million pieces of physical mail sent through the U.S. Postal Service - about 1.5% of our correspondence - are subject to constitutional privacy protections.    Simply put, this bill would update our privacy laws to keep pace with ever-changing technologies. Thomas Jefferson said, “The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground.” This bill is a win for liberty.

It's a free world, and people can make choices as they see fit...but if an employer has a no drug policy, should you and I pay for their choice to break with the employer's policy?!  Think about it. An employer says we don't allow you to turn up on the job site stoned to run a piece of heavy equipment. If someone gets hurt, we get hit with a lawsuit, work doesn't get done, people are at risk of injury, and more. This is hardly an unreasonable request!  In fact, it seems too crazy to be true...but it indeed is the case. And it gets worse.  Last year, the federal government created a rule that stopped states from drug testing most of these people before they get unemployment benefits. On a number of fronts, this makes no sense, and accordingly, I voted in favor of a resolution to repeal the rule last week, which passed 236 to 189.   As dad to four boys, I experienced first hand the notion that rules without consequence make little sense...which I think is a concept that applies here. What message is sent to drug users when the federal government rewards their behavior? If a person gets fired for doing drugs but can still collect a paycheck, there is little incentive to stop using and not wind up in the same place again. It defies logic.    Furthermore, the federal rule directly contradicts not only the principle of federalism but also the plain language of existing law. It is the states - not the federal government - that provide most of the funding for unemployment and pay the actual benefits provided to workers. Telling the states how they administer their state unemployment programs strikes me as a shocking example of federal and executive overreach. The Social Security Act even states, “The States shall have broad freedom to set up the type of unemployment compensation they wish.”  Perhaps most importantly, this is about doing what is best for the taxpayer. I certainly don’t want my taxes to be spent on unemployment for people who were fired for using drugs, and I imagine that I’m not alone on that one. Particularly at a time when federal and state budgets are stretched to their breaking point, there has to be a better way of spending the hard-earned money of the American people, and accordingly, I voted yes.","status",NA,NA,293,152,119,6,1,18,1,73

Here are three from last week and why I voted as I did:  Alaska Fish and Wildlife Rule: I voted to repeal another regulation that restricts hunting and wildlife practices on Alaska’s federal lands. This rule would hand over 76.8 million acres - 20% of Alaska’s land - to be controlled four thousand miles away in Washington. For comparison, 76.8 million acres is almost four times the size of South Carolina. At the end of the day, this debate boiled down to how much we really value the notion of federalism - one of the vital building blocks of our republic. Indeed, the state constitution Congress approved when Alaska applied for statehood in 1959 reserved the right to manage fish and wildlife practices, even on federal lands, to Alaska’s state government. An agreement should stay an agreement, and if left unchallenged, this action by the Fish and Wildlife Service could set a precedent for future top-down management decisions of wildlife refuges all across the country. Not only could this come in violation of previous agreements with states….but in many cases might hamper local perspective on the care of ecosystems which are unique and local and often times not well known from Washington.  State and Local Government Retirement Plans: I also voted to repeal a pair of rules that would treat state and local government run retirement plans in a very different way than private plans. Whether you work for government or the private sector you want your retirement savings there for you in retirement - accordingly why would we exempt local government plans from the same safeguards that are required in a company plan for amazon or walmart?  These two rules indeed allow cities and states to create their own government-run retirement plans - but exempt them from the requirements and rules of private plans. This is odd given the ways in which government - at all levels - doesn't have a stellar history of managing retirement benefits. Indeed, pension plans run by state and local governments are already underfunded by $5 trillion, and Social Security is underfunded to the tune of $32 trillion.   Family Planning Funding: I voted to repeal a 30-page Health and Human Services rule that prohibits states from determining how best to allocate federal money sent to the state to help fund family planning clinics. Federal funds too often come with strings attached, and I think it's important to allow states to pick the venues they determine most appropriate and best in providing a service.","status",NA,NA,82,38,9,1,0,0,0,0

One, Saturday was busy for me as a day filled with town hall meetings. I want to thank the folks that came out and made their voices heard. They were meaningful exchanges. In some cases, we agreed, and in others, we didn’t - but even in the differences of perspectives, I appreciated the civility that marked the day and the conversations that came with it. I learned a lot and hope others did too. Below is a link that will give you a little feel for the day.  Our next town hall will come this Friday in Beaufort at the Technical College of the Lowcountry at 2:00 PM.  Finally, I want to give credit where credit’s due. It hit me at the president’s visit and the Boeing event last week how people often forget what that site looked like just a few years back and the imagination that it took to envision what we see today at Boeing Charleston.   For me, two people stand out for the way that Boeing would not be there today without them. One is Bob Faith. He was my original Secretary of Commerce back during the governor's years and walked in the office one day with an article from Fortune about composite materials and commercial aircraft. His point was that something was happening here, and he believed that there was a play for South Carolina. He was both clairvoyant and determined in his pursuit of Boeing and its predecessors, Vought and Alenia, that invested the original $600 million that started what we see today. Next time you see him around town, give him a shout-out.   The other person is Enzo Caiazzo. We negotiated with him and his team at Alenia, and he will be my guest tomorrow night at the president’s Joint Address to Congress. Though Italian by birth, he has become Charlestonian by heart and deserves credit for his part in making our local dreams of what is now Boeing a reality.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/videos/622878327921952/",NA,73,25,2,4,0,0,0,0

Bill Pascrell attempted to use an obscure legislative tool called a “Privileged Resolution of the House” to call on President Trump to release his tax returns.   I wanted to support him because I have long believed that the Trump tax return issue is important and ultimately has little to do with his returns - and everything to do with sustaining our fifty year tradition for republican and democratic presidential nominees on this front. If there was a way I could have done so without making a mockery of House rules, I would have done so. But rules are rules for any institution - and are part of what create ordered debate, rather than a simple shout-fest as we iron our opposing points of view on the floor of the House and Senate.  Privileged resolutions are raised to address things like the seating of members and staff, conduct on the House floor, and protection of House records…and unfortunately, these rules have nothing to do with compelling another branch of government to produce tax returns. So, our vote last night was on whether or not the chair's ruling was right on if this proposal was germane to that which Rep. Pascrell was attempting to attach it.   The clear vote there was no. But given my history on this subject, I thought it best to simply vote ""present.""

Tonight will be President Trump’s first address to the Joint Session of Congress, and it will be informative for the way in which he’ll describe legislative hopes and plans for the year. This annual ritual has typically entailed a laundry list of wants from the executive branch from both Republican and Democratic presidents alike. In this regard, we know that there will be a proposal for a $54 billion increase to defense, we know that he will lay out details on his healthcare, immigration, infrastructure, and tax plans…but the one thing that I’ll be listening for is how these proposals get paid for.  We really are at an inflection point as a civilization. We cannot continue to go on spending as we have and expect there to be no repercussion in the value of our currency, inflation, and ultimately our way of life. Let me leave you with two reasons you should be listening as well for an addressing of the debt and deficit issue.  One, everybody in Washington seems to forget the fact that what goes up can come down. We are now in the fourth longest economic recovery in the history of our nation. Trees don’t grow to the sky. Averages exist because while things sometimes go up…they go down too. This phenomenon is not really built into the budget forecast that will drive the size and scope of the American debt and deficits coming our way. In short, what I’m saying is that the length of this expansion makes it all the more important to address the debt and deficit before we next go into an economic recession. That day will come again, and if we haven’t gotten ahead of this issue, it will make our spending, debt, and deficit problem that much worse.  Two, there is a great amount of economic data that shows high levels of debt encumber an economy. In short, you can’t get to 4% growth with a debt-to-GDP number of ninety-percent. I know I’m getting into mind-numbing numbers here, but this point fits with what we all know. In our home or business, if we get laden with debt, money that could have gone toward education, new equipment, or any of the tools that would raise our ability to produce income in the household or business instead would have to go to interest payments. When you take this phenomenon as a nation, the same effect holds true. Money that could have gone toward productive investment in our society instead is dedicated to paying for past bills.  What am I saying in all this?   I hope in tonight’s joint session that the president talks about how we pay for the many promises that come in what we consider a State of the Union speech.","status",NA,NA,106,37,9,3,0,0,0,0

One of the things he mentioned was that he believed our allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should live up to the agreement. I agree and this would mean that they would take on a greater share of the financial obligations with regard to their own defense.   Under the category of giving credit where it’s due, I believe President Trump is not only right on this issue, but that the good cop, bad cop approach seems to be beginning to work here.   It was not widely reported by the media, but Germany has already announced an increase of 20,000 troops. This is an important and significant step. The U.S. spends $410,000 per troop per year for everything from pay to equipment, and this means for the US to do the same would cost American taxpayers about $8.2 billion a year.   President Trump has repeatedly said that other NATO members haven’t been paying their fair share on military spending, and the numbers support his claim. The NATO Treaty requires member nations to spend at least 2% of their GDP (Gross Domestic Product) on defense, but only 5 of the 28 nations in NATO are currently doing so. For instance, France spends 1.78%,  Germany spends 1.19%, and the average for NATO nations other than the U.S. is only 1.43%.  By contrast, the U.S. spends nearly double the required amount at about 3.5% of GDP. That’s roughly $583 billion a year...and 65% of all military spending within NATO. To bring all these numbers to a personal level, we spent $1,865 for the military last year per U.S. citizen, while for NATO Europe, that figure was just $446.   Considered altogether, if the other member nations of NATO were hitting their 2% GDP targets, they would be spending $101 billion more combined on their military budgets.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/photos/a.124615434414913.1073741828.118387985037658/624392271103891/?type=3",NA,85,56,23,1,0,1,0,0

Why would we now water down this same bill and send a new and weaker bill to President Trump?   With regard to a healthcare bill moving forward, I see leadership’s healthcare plan as an opening proposal. In as much as President Donald J. Trump views many things as a negotiation, I’m quite sure he would rarely take any party’s opening bid.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee marked up the bill from yesterday morning to about mid-day today. It’s unusual for a committee to go all through the night without stopping, but they did so. And that gives one an indication of how fast they are attempting to move on this bill. The Ways and Means Committee marked up as well.  Throughout the day, I’ve been in three meetings on this issue. In fact, my day started with a conversation from here in DC on the Kelly Golden Show back home in Charleston. What was interesting about that visit is that Kelly asked me to come on to respond to the Vice President Mike Pence joining their show this morning. He gave three radio interviews in the early morning...in each case, in the districts of Members who have raised questions about some of what’s incorporated into the American Health Care Act being rushed forward. This morning’s district calls by the Vice President included Jim Jordan of Ohio, Justin Amash of Michigan, and myself. American Action Network also began running a TV ad series this morning in the district advancing the American Health Care Act.  While these different points of advocacy are what come in advancing any political idea, I continue to remain concerned about three facets of this bill.  One, there are several portions of the bill that amount to open-ended commitments by the taxpayer. For instance, in its present form, it would leave open Medicaid expansion for the next three years. In my view, this will create the unintended consequence of encouraging governors and legislative bodies across the country to expand their Medicaid rolls. If the door is closing and you see there’s a three-year window before it does so, does it not encourage a political body to grab more federal dollars while they can?  Two, it’s built upon the notion of “let’s get it done, but trust me later for the details.” Ronald Reagan encouraged the opposite in transactions, as his thinking was more along the lines of “trust, but verify.” If we pass the first portion of the bill, but change in the delivery and cost of healthcare in our country is predicated on stages two and three, what happens if two and three don’t happen?  This is very important. The things that would most impact the cost of healthcare, and by extension its availability, are built into stage three of this process. If Republicans pass healthcare that doesn’t positively impact the cost and availability of healthcare for Americans, the “victory” on changing the Affordable Care Act will prove to be a pyrrhic one.  Finally, we need to be careful about rushing a bill like this that involves nearly one-fifth of the American economy without thoroughly vetting its many repercussions and consequences. The one thing I’ve heard in talking to folks at home is that their healthcare really matters. I am committed to the notion of repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act…but we really do need to make certain it’s with something that betters people’s lives, creates a more robust marketplace that in turn helps in the pricing of medicine…and finally something that doesn’t heap onto the taxpayer yet new liabilities.   In any case, that’s a quick update from my end on the day’s activities on the American Health Care Act. I will continue to try and keep you posted.","video","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHcgWgYt3HI&feature=youtu.be",NA,84,74,16,0,0,1,1,1

The bill passed 371 to 48, and I voted yes. The House actually voted on a bill to fund the military for this year back in June, but it never made it past the Senate. As a consequence, defense spending levels for 2016 were simply extended through April of 2017 - in what is called a continuing budget resolution. A new bill was needed to ensure that our military is funded beyond this point in the year. This bill is similar to the one from June, and has its good points and its bad points. If I could, I’d like to tell you a little about both, starting with the good.  This bill stays underneath caps on defense spending set out in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. When Congress takes measures to control the long-term growth of spending, it’s important we stick to those commitments....or at minimum come up with some other way of slowing Washington spending. The caps have represented the last remaining current tool for budget discipline in Washington.   This bill reverses the planned reduction in end strength levels, allowing for 24,000 more active-duty troops and 12,000 more reserve troops than requested by the previous administration. It fully funds a 2.1% pay raise for all members of our military, which is 0.5% more than requested and the first full pay increase for our troops in four years. Additional funding is designated for cybersecurity and cyberspace operations, which will help our nation stay ahead of the curve and ensure our cyber defenses are strong enough to thwart even the most sophisticated attacks. Also included is funding for the Marine Corps’ next-generation Amphibious Combat Vehicle, which happens to be built right here at home in the lowcountry.  There are a few areas in which this bill could have been better, though. For one, the overall funding level is more than it was last June, particularly in the warfighting funds section, which is not subject to spending caps. In the past, this section has included funding that should have been designated for regular operations, but was moved to the warfighting account in order to stay under spending caps. That sort of budget gimmickry makes a mockery of the budget process. While it appears this bill does not do this again in major form, I’m still concerned that at least some of the funding for overseas contingency operations belongs in the base budget.  No mention is made in this bill of a new Authorized Use of Military Force (AUMF) for the war on terror, which is disappointing. Our military is still operating under the AUMF passed more than 15 years ago in the wake of September 11th, 2001. This is to treat an AUMF as a blank check and that's wrong. If you say it's ok to fight a war 15 years ago, it does not mean you are saying its ok to fight one today. Accordingly, Congress needs to pass a new AUMF that reflects those changes.  One more concern I have is related to defense spending, but not specifically to this bill. It involves President Trump’s call for $54 billion more in defense spending in 2018, as well as a potential $30 billion supplementary defense spending request for 2017. It’s hard to imagine how Congress will manage to fit these additional funding requests in underneath the cap on defense spending. We better watch out. What you don’t want is a $50 billion increase in defense spending in the House that is matched by a $50 billion domestic spending increase in the Senate. I intend to watch this very closely.  Ultimately, though, this bill is about providing our military with the resources it needs to do the job we need it to do, whatever that job may be. Providing for the common defense is a core, constitutional responsibility of the federal government, and this bill fulfills that responsibility in a way that is mindful of our $20 trillion national debt, and so I voted in favor of its passage.","status",NA,NA,57,33,14,1,0,0,0,2

Two weeks ago I voted in support of H.R. 1009 – the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act. This bill would delay federal agencies from issuing regulations that would have an annual effect of at least $100 million on the economy. Unless the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs can determine that the agency responsible for the rule has minimized the costs and burdens to society, these regulations would be kept from publication.  Why is this important?  Because increasingly regulatory bodies have taken on the role of the legislative body. There are a whole host of competing interests and perspectives that would quite naturally react affirmatively and negatively to any new action of government. The Founding Fathers believed that the ironing out of those differences was best done by the legislative branch wherein officeholders would be directly beholden to the voters. This is not the case with millions of unelected Federal employees...in a pejorative sense: “bureaucrats.” This distinction is a vital one. It is not to say that we don’t want or need regulation in a civilized society. It is to say that for major pieces of regulation that have significant impact in our economy we ought to at least debate the idea before it’s enacted.  Our Founding Fathers gave us a system of checks and balances.

Unfortunately it carried the same flaws, and as a consequence I voted against it. It passed again, 224 to 194.  This bill would change the federal lawsuit process and make it easier for defendants to take cases out of state courts and put them before a federal judge. I have great concern for defendants being dragged into court when a case lacks merit, which is why I voted for another bill this morning to protect against that. In my view this bill went much further, and would pull too many cases to the federal level that I believe should more properly be decided at the state level.

During the last two debt limit increases, Congress for the first time set the limit at a date rather than an amount. This bill would end that practice. This is important because if I gave you my credit card and said “you’ve got it until you hit $7,500,” you might end up with one level of expenditure. On the other hand, if I said “you’ve got it until August 1st,” you might end up with a different level of expenditure. This in essence is what Congress has done over these two debt limit increases, and this is what this bill would stop in the future.   More specifically, the Constitution gave Congress the sole authority to manage the national debt and borrow on the US credit. Since 1939, Congress has fulfilled this responsibility by voting to set a maximum dollar amount for how much our country can owe at any given time, which is known as the debt limit.  But, since 2011, a series of unconventional agreements reached between congressional leadership and the president have resulted in automatic debt limit increases that do not require a vote in Congress. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 authorized a series of three debt limit increases spread out over two years, which were automatically triggered upon the president’s request.  In 2013, the No Budget, No Pay Act caused the debt limit to be suspended entirely for the first time in our nation’s history. That suspension was the first of four successive debt limit suspensions. With the current suspension ending today, it will have been the longest debt limit suspension period in our history...lasting 502 days.  Over the past 15 years, our national debt has grown more than threefold, going from $5.8 trillion to nearly $20 trillion where it stands today. The debt limit has been raised 15 times over that same period, and our national debt continues to grow at an accelerating pace.   This bill is all about not allowing debt limit increases to be automatic and not reviewed by Congress. With each increase should come reflection and debate on how increasingly dire our spending picture really is.   This bill, the Debt Limit Control and Accountability Act, would prevent the Treasury Department from employing its “extraordinary measures” to avoid breaching the debt limit and repeal the authority for the president to modify the debt limit. It would also express the sense of Congress that the debt limit should not be suspended, that increases should be tied to controls on the long-term growth of spending, and that the Treasury Department should prioritize payments in a way that prevents a default, should Congress fail to raise the debt limit.  The bottom line is that for all the problems that loom on our nation’s horizon, our Founding Fathers gave us the ability and the tools to fix them. One of those tools, the debt limit, has been blunted so severely that it is now ineffective. This bill would sharpen that tool, so it can again be used for its intended purpose of limiting our national debt...and that, in my view, is a most important thing these days.","status",NA,NA,66,18,19,3,0,1,0,0

Of greatest significance was the vote in the House Budget Committee GOP. The committee voted to send the American Health Care Act - House leadership’s Affordable Care Act (ACA) repeal bill - to the House floor. I was joined by two other Republicans and fellow members of the House Freedom Caucus, Congressman Dave Brat and Congressman Gary Palmer, in voting against the motion.  Since last week, when a number of us held a press conference in front of the Capitol on the importance of changes to the American Health Care Act, conservatives in the House have been looking for ways to get to yes. It is the squeaky wheels though that get greased in politics. If you don’t object, they simply move the bill as it is.   In fact, it’s been interesting to watch Speaker Ryan’s evolution over the past week on the bill itself. On March 9th, he said the bill would not be amended and that it would be a straight up or down vote. But because of resistance from conservatives, he said yesterday that we can make necessary improvements and refinements to the bill.   This very much fits with what the president has said all along, as he has labeled it “a big, fat, beautiful negotiation.” Secretary Price has called it a “work in progress.”   The point in these hold-out votes is that while they’re not fun, they are necessary to improving the bill. Indeed, that’s why I said at our press conference that I viewed leadership’s original bill as the starting point in a negotiation. My point then was that President Donald J. Trump would never take the first offer in a real estate deal, and we shouldn’t either. This is particularly the case given the way that there have not been the traditional congressional hearings and debate that you would see in an issue as big as healthcare.   The point in all of this is that the Affordable Care Act is not sustainable and is not working for the majority of people who help pay for it in the individual insurance marketplace. I am pushing for change, but in this rush to get a bill, I think that it’s important that the conservative principles that I believe in - and that so many at home who sent me to Washington to represent their point of view believe in - should not be erased in the headlong rush to get a “political win” and the headlines that say healthcare got dealt with. What people want to see is a drop in their premiums and greater choices in the way in which they can buy insurance. If Republicans’ reform does not do this, I think a lot of people will be upset, given their need for remedy.  In my continued laundry list of issues for the day, this evening the House voted on H.R. 1181, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act, and it passed 240 to 175.   This bill would prohibit the Department of Veterans Affairs from submitting veterans’ names to the FBI simply because they are not managing their own benefits. This vote was similar to one that had occurred earlier, wherein the Social Security Administration was unilaterally attempting to take from people a constitutional right because someone was not administering their own paperwork. Our Founding Fathers set up a system of checks and balances and with something as significant as constitutional rights, it’s vital that we adhere to them.  Finally, in the news today, there was brief discussion of a portion of the president’s proposed budget that would privatize the Air Traffic Control system in this country. This provision was taken from the bill that the Transportation Committee, that I sit on, marked up last year. We will have another bite at the apple on this proposal this year, but it was encouraging to see the president come out in support of what we’ve been trying to do on this front. I say this because I have long believed that that which only government can do, government should do...but that which can be done by the private sector should be left to the private sector. In the case of Air Traffic Control systems, there are a host of examples around the world wherein this activity has been well-handled by the private sector, and I believe that it’s something that could work here.","status",NA,NA,97,76,29,5,0,0,1,2

I voted for the bill, which passed 237-178.  In April of 2014, a retired VA employee came forward with accusations that senior managers at the VA hospital in Phoenix had instructed their staff to maintain a secret list of patients waiting for appointments, for the purpose of artificially lowering the reported average wait time. Sadly, the incident at the Phoenix VA proved to be only the tip of an iceberg.   In response to the unfolding scandal, Congress passed a comprehensive VA reform bill called the Veterans’ Access to Choice and Accountability Act in August of 2014. That bill included a provision granting the Secretary of Veterans Affairs expedited authority to demote or fire senior-level employees for poor performance or misconduct. The VA Accountability First Act would expand that authority to cover all employees at the VA. Employees who have filed for whistleblower status, however, would be protected from retaliatory disciplinary actions.   The bill shrinks the timeline for appeals of disciplinary actions from the current 349 days to just 45. During this time, employees with cases under appeal could not receive pay, bonuses or other benefits, nor could they be placed on paid administrative leave. VA employees who do not succeed in their appeal, or who decide not to appeal at all, could be forced to repay any awards, bonuses or relocation expenses they may have been given. If an employee is convicted of a felony, they would be subject to a reduction in their retirement benefits.  It's a small, but common sense measure that goes to the heart of spending resources in a better way. Since 2011, the VA has paid out almost $650 million in malpractice lawsuit settlements and $200 million to settle disputed construction contracts….and it is better management that can impact numbers like these.","status",NA,NA,49,11,15,3,0,0,0,0

One, with all the bombast of late in the world of politics, I like the fact that he is recognized as being most civil by both Republicans and Democrats. We will all have our different perspectives and points of view, but part of hearing another person rests on civility and respect.  In fact, on this front, there was an article by Jess Bravin in The Wall Street Journal today that talked about how Judge Gorsuch has won praise from Democrats for his civility and respect for opposing views.   Judge Gorsuch has said that the role of a judge is “to hear courteously, answer wisely, consider soberly, and decide impartially” and that they should “regularly issue judgments with which they disagree as a matter of policy - all because they think that’s what the law fairly demands.”   My admiration for him goes well beyond civility. He has a keen understanding of our constitutional system and the limits that it imposes on each the three branches of government. Regardless of one’s political perspective, it would seem to me that all of us would want to see each branch contained by constitutional bounds. This means when things aren’t going in the direction we’d like, we’re able to take solace in the checks and balances built into the system the Founding Fathers created.  Although the Constitution doesn’t give the House a vote on Supreme Court nominations, I signed on to a letter supporting the Gorsuch nomination along with 82 of my House colleagues...you can read the letter below.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/photos/a.124615434414913.1073741828.118387985037658/632020327007752/?type=3",NA,83,46,12,0,0,1,0,3

At this point, the vote is scheduled for Thursday, and as one might imagine, this is a week of intense political pressure, many visits, calls, and much conversation on its passage. This morning, President Trump came by the Republican Conference meeting and laid out his reasoning as to why the bill should pass.   I’ve had seven town hall meetings at home over the last four weekends and have heard from many people who want things to stay as they are. Their advocacy has been heartfelt, though it occasionally crosses the line into rude or cantankerous just to create an effect. As I was at the receiving end of those charges, I occasionally had to wonder about the efficacy of arguments made by people who have a great problem with Donald Trump’s style, demeanor, and bearing…but then go on to use similar browbeating tactics as their way of advancing an idea. But passion behind ideas we believe in can cause people to do things they might not do under normal circumstances, and so for me, the question of style is a longer conversation for another day. The bottom line is that I heard a number of things that were useful and are a part of my deliberations as we approach this vote.   From still a different perspective, last night I was in a very long meeting with other conservatives who continue to struggle with the underlying merits of the bill. They included people like Mark Meadows who was with Trump before he even officially declared as a candidate, but who as a conservative is at this point still against the bill. Sometimes it seems it would take Solomon’s wisdom to mediate the competing interests and perspectives that are built into a bill as consequential as this one. I certainly don’t have that sort of wisdom, but the collective perspective of thousands across the First District of South Carolina is most helpful in getting close.  For that reason, let me ask one last time for input. I have heard pretty much all the talking points from both sides of this debate. But if you think yours has been missed, I’d really appreciate you telling me now, as I indeed make final deliberations on a bill that really matters to so many of the people that I represent at home along the coast of South Carolina.

It began with a meeting at the White House on healthcare - and ended just a few moments ago with another meeting on the same topic. With the exception of two vote series, I have been in and out of meetings, calls, and visits on this subject through the day. Some of these exchanges have been more cordial than others.  There is much worth relating in this day, and I will come back and do so, but before the events of today and tomorrow crowd out the legislative activity of the last two days, I wanted to send a quick update on two of the bills passed. These bills passed with unanimous Republican support and even a number of Democratic yes votes. Interestingly, these two bills were both included in the replacement bill Senator Rand Paul and I offered last month in our proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act.  The Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act (H.R. 372) ends a competition killing piece of legislation, known as McCarron-Ferguson. The McCarron bill passed back in 1945 under pressure from insurance industry lobbying and exempted insurance companies from federal antitrust laws. As a result, they have not been bound by federal prohibitions on corporate collusion, price fixing, and monopolies, and obviously each of these practices can drive up prices for consumers. Currently, just three health insurance companies control 80% of the market in 37 states, and most would hardly consider this great soil conditions for the growth of competition. The Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act repeals this 72 year old carve-out, as it applies to health insurance companies in about 1 page of legislative text. I believe applying federal antitrust laws to health insurance companies will benefit hospitals, doctors, and patients as insurers are forced to compete. Accordingly, I voted yes.   The second bill, the Small Business Health Fairness Act (H.R, 1101), would reduce government barriers that hamstring legitimate small businesses from joining together in groups to negotiate for more affordable health insurance plans for their employees. Most people get their insurance through employer-sponsored plans, and big companies have buying power that individuals or small businesses do not.  Size matters when it comes to negotiating strength, and this bill would allow small businesses to pool together and create buying power.   These buying groups, called Association Health Plans, are currently allowed but heavily restricted. The Department of Labor regulations make it difficult for groups to band together for buying power, and in simplest form, this bill would make it easier. This bill would reduce barriers and allow dues-collecting organizations with a common purpose, like local chambers of commerce, to form an Association Health Plan. According, I voted yes.","status",NA,NA,191,207,42,8,0,2,0,0

Accordingly, with so much at stake for so many, it’s my view that its worth taking just a little more time to get things right.  I started to speak on this very point on the House floor a few hours ago, but time was limited. What little I did say is below.  There are pieces that have been added to this bill as late as this morning. This is highly unusual. Normally we mark-up bills through the committee system and there are hearings that precede these mark-up's. This was not done here. Normally we have three days to review a bill before voting on it. We took a vote this morning that waives this normal practice so that we may vote on it today. Deliberation on changes to something that represents a fifth of the American economy is probably wise because the last thing conservatives need in advancing market concepts in health-care is a Nancy Pelosi moment of ""vote on it so you can find all the details"" of what is in this bill.   I was just in a very powerful meeting for the way that its participants were humbly trying to discern a right path on this bill.

It marked the end of a very long and tumultuous week, but before I head home, I wanted to write a few thoughts on what’s transpired and what it means. This debate in large measure has been intense over the last month. I have literally had thousands of conversations with people at home on this subject during this time.  In setting the stage and doing so, a few hours ago, I left one of the more inspiring and powerful meetings that I’ve ever experienced during my time in politics. For even those most cynical about politics today, you would have been as inspired as I was in being a part of what took place. Vice President Mike Pence, HHS Secretary Tom Price, M.D., and the President's Chief of Staff all stepped in and surprised the group with their attendance. The Vice President did most of the talking, and I cannot describe to you how impressed I was in the way that he acted as an emissary for the president.  After they left, there was much heartfelt discussion on what people believed might best represent the people that they represent back home. There was conversation about how best to support President Donald J. Trump. There was deliberation on how to best incorporate market principles and conservative ideals. In short, people were tired, emotionally worn, but absolutely committed to the kind of deeply reflective analysis and conversation that’s vital to good outcomes. Not everyone agreed on many of the points covered, but everyone was deeply respectful to the differing points of view within the room. If we had more discussions like these in any political body, church vestry, or corporate boardroom, we wouldn’t always find the right solution, but the process by which we got there would include everyone and make for better solutions.  All this having been said, let me be clear that I believe that I understand a couple of keys critical to the healthcare debate before us…. I think the same is true for so many I have talked with over the last few weeks.  One, I believe it’s essential that we indeed repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. It's equally vital we replace it with something that helps people at home and across this country in addressing healthcare needs and paying for them in the individual health insurance marketplace. I am committed to doing so, and what I’ve found is that seeming stopping points can ultimately prove to be beginning points in life and the things we work on. Accordingly, I believe today’s action will prove to be a catalyst that will bring a variety of philosophical perspectives together in forging a consensus to do just that.  Two, politics is the art of the possible. This is not an academic debate, and perfection in some philosophic sense should not be held as the standard by which we judge legislation. My years as governor taught me this. It’s been reinforced in life in coming to hopefully have the wisdom of knowing just a portion of all I don’t know. This said, it’s vital that we not codify bad ideas...and for groups that range from The Heritage Foundation to FreedomWorks to a whole host of other associations and perspectives, many people came to believe that this bill in its present form just wasn’t there yet.  Three, a win on this issue went well beyond the issue of healthcare for the president, the Congress, and Republicans as a governing party. This is just one of the reasons that the group assembled in that room a few hours ago wanted so much to find a way to get to yes. In the end though, it was Calvin Coolidge who said “It is much more important to kill bad bills than to pass good ones….”  And again, many believed this one just wasn't there yet, given the outcry from so many differing vantage points on its passage.  The bill in its present form had three very significant flaws in my view…  One, it didn’t repeal the Affordable Care Act. It was done this way because of leadership’s decision to use reconciliation as the vehicle by which they would move this bill to the Senate. This had the advantage of fewer necessary votes in the Senate, but the disadvantage of only partial repeal of a bill that the House had voted on 60 times over the last six years to indeed repeal. What was especially telling here was the fact that as late as last year, Congress sent to President Obama a bill of full repeal that was passed unanimously by Republican House and Senate members. Many of us asked many times why we were not just sending that bill that we sent to President Obama’s desk to President Trump? Our view was let Senate or House members explain why in the world they were for a watered-down version of repeal now that there is a Republican in the White House….when just months before had supported a much more robust bill.  Two, the decreases in the cost of an insurance premium would not come as a result of this bill. They would come in what was described as Bucket two and three that would come in time. Bucket two would come through enhancement of federal powers in this bill that would have strengthened the Secretary’s hand in making unilateral change. While this could be helpful with a Secretary of Health and Human Services as conservative as Tom Price, it could be used to a very different effect by later presidents and secretaries, should the political tide change. This was of long-term concern. Of short-term concern was the fact that any unilateral action by a Secretary can be challenged by the courts. Many conservative members of Congress who were former judges believed that this was a recipe for disaster. That the Secretary’s hands would be bound in ways that prevented reform and aid to small business people in the individual marketplace could undermine the very objectives of the bill.  Bucket three looked to be even more problematic. This would involve statutory change, and this came with two considerable problems. One was time. The normal Congress has probably two or three big issues before it; this Congress has seven or eight. This means that by the time we get through the budget, infrastructure, the debt ceiling, the sequester, the wall and immigration, FAA reauthorization, tax reform, and more, we will be into next year. And there is a real danger in this. Bucket three is the free-market reforms that would lower the cost of insurance premiums. But, if they don’t come until after the midterm congressional elections, I’m not sure how all this works out. People have wanted repeal to the Affordable Care Act because it hurts them. It hasn’t been philosophic - their premiums have gone up. If we pass healthcare and have supposedly checked that box, but people don’t see a change in what they pay, how is a single payer system not the supposed next answer? If one has tried the Affordable Care Act and then alleged market-based reforms (even if those market-based reforms were not really a part of the bill), how do people not next claim single payer is the answer? If we are going to give market principles a try, I think we should actually give them a real chance to show their worth.  The other problem with bucket three was that it’s still dependent on 60 votes in the Senate. We’ve had much debate about the artificial vote constraints in the Senate, and even the artificial rules with regard to filibuster and the ways in which that hampers conservative ideas moving forward. But if one does not change those rules in the Senate, reconciliation is not a panacea. You still have to pick up democratic votes to pass healthcare reforms that impact the very heart of what has frustrated so many across the First Congressional District.   Three, it did not change the foundation of the Affordable Care Act, which is found in Title 1 of that bill. What was proposed for today was good in the way that it got rid of taxes and penalties, but ultimately, these things were just financing vehicles for the foundation of what drove costs within the Affordable Care Act. This foundation is community ratings. These represent price controls. In the same way that price controls for rental apartments in New York City benefited some, while simultaneously distorting the marketplace for many more, this goes to the core of what the Affordable Care Act does.   As long as we leave that foundation in place, it will have a distorting effect in the individual marketplace. These distortions are what created the need for penalties and rewards designed to get people to do what the invisible hand of the marketplace would otherwise do. The question we all have to ask on this is whether a great House can be built on a bad foundation or sandy soil. In short, what I’m saying here is that we need to distinguish between the 80% of folks in the individual marketplace for whom insurance can work - and the 20% for whom it does not.   For the 80% of us who will largely be healthy over the course of our lives, we need to let insurance work. The premise of insurance is that we all save for a rainy day that comes for only some of us. The Affordable Care Act flipped on its head the idea of pricing risk, the idea of consequences, and a whole lot more, and therefore priced out of the marketplace many young people who instead simply chose to pay a penalty. With the incentives in place, the insurance pool became increasingly self selecting in bad ways that made it mathematically unsustainable. One can see this most recently in eastern Tennessee where 43,000 people are now without any form of insurance in the individual marketplace.   For the 20% of us who draw a bad genetic card or find ourselves in a horrific accident, I believe that rather than cost shifting from others in the relatively small individual marketplace, we should be overt. As a society, we should have a debate on how best to care for people in these conditions...but not do as we do in the Affordable Care Act, which is to hide the costs of a cost shift to care for these people who have profound health care needs.   All of this is worth a much longer conversation, but I wanted to give a couple of preliminary thoughts...given what just transpired here in Washington.","status",NA,NA,246,245,109,18,1,0,0,12

Res. 34, a bill that would repeal a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rule requiring internet service providers to get your explicit permission before using and sharing your confidential information. This includes things ranging from Social Security numbers to information on your children. The bill passed by a vote of 215 to 205. I was one of 15 Republicans to vote against the bill and would like to explain why I thought it was important to do so.  Each one of the rights enshrined in the Constitution are fragile. Without active and constant defense, seemingly unimportant things chip away at what the Founding Fathers set up in freedom being the hallmark of the American experiment. This was a vote about pushing back at one of those seemingly innocuous things creeping in and taking from us a building block of freedom.  The Fourth Amendment ensures: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”  And that’s what this vote came down to.  Should you - or should the company through which you get internet service - be the decision maker in determining whether your information can be sold? Are you given the direct choice to waive the right of determining this or are you not?  With this vote, I said it should be you.   The FCC rule simply applies this notion to your online privacy by putting the decision over the use of confidential information back in the the hands of the customer. So, when the government blocks a rule intended to solidify this fundamental cornerstone, as it did yesterday, it effectively chips away at it.   On this theme, civil liberty is a fundamental part of liberty. In the age of terrorism and the internet, it tends to be a component of liberty that people focus less on…but we do this at our own peril. The Founding Fathers actually took the time to enumerate this right. They saw it as just as important as the right to free speech or the right to bear arms...and accordingly, I think we should too. Because where one right is corroded, I would argue it becomes easier to weaken others.   It's for this reason that in just the past couple years I voted for and co-sponsored the Email Privacy Act twice. I voted against the USA Freedom Act multiple times because it didn’t go far enough to reign in bulk data collection under the Patriot Act. And, this January, I introduced the REAL ID Privacy Protection Act to strip the REAL ID law of its privacy-compromising provisions.   I was disappointed when I learned that the House would be voting on the bill to block the FCC’s rule, and some even tried to portray it as a jurisdictional issue between the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. But this issue at the core had much bigger implications, which is why I voted as I did.","status",NA,NA,364,170,84,20,0,3,10,1

My dad would get us as boys to sit down with a legal pad and put a plus column on one side and a minus column on the other. We would then begin to list under each column the so-called plusses and minuses that would help lead me or my brothers’ decisions on where to go to college, on whether or not to join a sports team, or which summer job might work best.  So it goes with legislation, and on H.R. 1430, the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act, I believe there were ultimately more minuses than plusses. Accordingly, I voted no. The bill passed 228 to 194.   At first blush, it seemed a straightforward bill because it would simply require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use scientific information in making government regulations and post their data publicly online.   In fact, it was more complex than this, and when I got under the hood on this bill, I had two major reservations. One was tied to the idea of balance in the way that we approach problems, that the context of a decision bears on the decision itself, and the other was tied to the bill’s implementation. Let me expand on both of these thoughts.  On the implementation front, they say you can do business in Italy...but as a practical matter, can you? I don’t mean this as a crack against Italian businesses, but I do mean it in the way that at times things can be arranged so that advertised purposes don’t measure up in the real world with the outcomes that have been advertised. We’ve all seen certain barriers to business that are de facto stops against a small business being able to compete in a given county or against a large business in a neighborhood.   Here’s what this meant in this bill.   The bill says that the scientific data behind regulations needs to be posted online. This is good, and I agree with it. The catch here is that if this was not done, the regulation could not go into effect. But the bill allocates only $1 million toward posting this information online when the real cost is estimated to be $250 million. So what this means is that no regulation could go into effect, given the agency’s newfound inability to post the information online. I’m as much against the EPA as anyone else for the way in which they have gone beyond their mission on several fronts, but it’s important that we not throw the baby out with the bathwater because there is a legitimate function for environmental protection. If we want to stop all regulation from the EPA, let’s just be direct about it. I don’t believe that there would be an American consensus to do so...but I think that we should all be wary of bills that bring with them the either intended, or unintended, consequence of essentially shutting down all regulation from an agency of which most of us as conservatives are rightfully skeptical.  Which brings me to my second point, balance.   I liked much of what this bill was getting at...backing up the what, where, why, and when of regulation, and making it public. For this reason I supported this measure last year. But that was a very different context. The Obama Administration had given the EPA license to expand well beyond its mandate - and even the limits of the law. In that context, to me, it made sense to look for every tool available to limit some of what they were doing.   This is not the case today. The new EPA Director Scott Pruitt has said that he is going to heavily curtail EPA activities. The president has said the same. I’m not worried about the EPA taking unilateral actions in the way that they did with the last administration.   My worry now is on the opposite side. The woods and the waters of the South Carolina Lowcountry are what have attracted so many here and kept the rest of us here over the years. The EPA does a role in air and water matters of our country given the way in which neither stay within the confines of a given state.   For this reason, in this Congress I voted against the proposed rollback of the Natural Gas and Methane Waste rule. That rule in particular limited the practice of venting large amounts of capturable natural gas into the atmosphere, leading to an expected $800 million in wasted returns to the taxpayer...along with large discharges of methane into the air we breathe. I was one of 11 Republicans to vote against that rollback in February.   Similarly, I voted in early February to defend the Stream Protection Rule, which regulated mountaintop removal mining in order to protect streams and rivers. As a conservative, my belief has always been that your rights end when they begin to infringe upon mine. What happens upstream impacts you or me downstream, and the rolling back of this rule would have pretended that this was not the case.   I could go on with other examples, but my point here is that from the standpoint of context with this new administration and even the actual implementation of the bill itself, I think that this bill was found wanting, and accordingly I voted as I did.","status",NA,NA,122,62,12,11,0,0,0,0

These conversations have been ongoing since leadership pulled the replacement bill last Friday. In the interim, there have been all sorts of threats and more from differing corners, even to the point most recently of one on the White House team threatening a great conservative member from Michigan, Justin Amash. Despite this backdrop, the conversation tonight was most productive.  I am reminded of two things in all this:  One, as my good friend Cubby always used to say, ""When emotion is high, discernment is low."" In any high pressure situation, it's easy to lash out or to blame the other person.... What I have seen in all this is that on policy as important as this, we need to keep the eye on the prize - and that is outcomes that affect the people who are now in the individual health insurance market and struggling with the availability and pricing it now affords.  Two, patience can be a virtue. It's important that we not just do something but that we do something that helps the very people just mentioned...and the scores of others impacted by the pricing, availability, and quality of healthcare. A win cannot be in name only. There have to be measurable outcomes. In this light, it's important to remember that, thus far, this replacement bill saw 17 legislative days prior to the Friday we were to have voted. In contrast, the Affordable Care Act saw 186 days. Medicare part D, advanced by President Bush, saw 166 days. Legislation as important to people as the healthcare that impacts both their lives and their pocketbooks is best not jammed from the top down over a two-week period.  In short, this has been rushed. I believe we can get there, but we have to get it more right than what we saw last time...and I am hopeful that we may be on a path to doing so based on the very conversations we just had.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/photos/a.124615434414913.1073741828.118387985037658/638431213033330/?type=3",NA,109,72,20,4,1,1,0,3

Apple, Google, and others began this way. First an idea. Second, a start...and then things grew from there.  In this light, the House passed H.R. 1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act, today, and it simply updated an outdated regulation to make it easier for startup companies to pay their employees with company stock. The bill passed by a vote of 331-87, and I voted in favor of it.                                                              This vote was about the competitiveness of our country and the way in which we can be a home to the incubation of new ideas. This does not mean just places like Silicon Valley, but it means cities like Charleston. For instance, Ceterus, an online accounting startup, and PureCars, a company that provides digital marketing services for automotive dealers call the lowcountry home. While startups in Silicon Valley and Charleston are separated by an entire continent, they share many of the same obstacles to success. One of the biggest challenges is keeping initial salary costs low while the company develops its product and brings it to market.                                                                                                    While many startups compensate their employees through stock in the company, they are limited to how much stock they can issue in a year without having to file extensive financial information with the federal government. That can work fine for a big company but does not fit with a start-up.   H.R. 1343 would simply update existing law and increase that limit from $5 million $10 million and ensure that limit rises in the future to account for inflation. Updating the law will hopefully help out many of these new businesses opening across the country and clear the way for the next Google or Facebook….with a start I hope in the Lowcountry!","status",NA,NA,48,15,5,2,0,0,0,0

Unfortunately, this procedural privilege has been increasingly abused - and it's now gotten to a point that it undermines both the institution and the Constitution which established it.   Even though no Democrat opposed Judge Gorsuch’s appointment to the Court of Appeals a decade ago, his current nomination only passed the Senate Judiciary Committee this week by a narrow, party-line vote. Now, Democrats are promising to require 60 votes to allow a final confirmation vote on the floor.      The Constitution allows both houses of Congress to set their own rules, but what if an internal rule presents a conflict with the legislative body’s external responsibilities towards another branch of government as required by the Constitution?  This is what we have today. The Senate’s traditions have grown so out of hand that they undermine what the Constitution lays out in the way the Senate should process the nominations of the executive branch. It only requires the “advice and consent” of the Senate - in other words, an up-or-down majority vote by the Senate - for someone the president nominates to be appointed to an office.    Historically, there were no partisan filibusters of judicial nominations before 2003. In 2013, the filibuster was changed to apply only to legislation and Supreme Court nominations. Now we’re about to see the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in U.S. history...and, most likely, the end of the filibuster on nominations of any kind.   That sets up the larger question...does the Democrat’s case against Gorsuch really rise to that level? There’s certainly blame to go around on both sides for how we’ve reached this point, and I think the larger trend is concerning for the political process overall, but  “an eye for an eye” leaves everybody blind.    All that said, it appears that Judge Gorsuch will likely be confirmed by the end of this week one way or another.

The same notion also applies to starting a business. In that vein, the House passed a bill Thursday to make that process just a little bit easier. H.R. 1219, the Supporting America’s Innovators Act, would increase the number of people allowed in groups that invest in startup companies without facing additional federal regulations. The bill passed by a vote of 417 to 3. I voted “yes,” and I wanted to offer some thoughts as to why….  You may have a great idea and all the enthusiasm in the world, but if you don’t have the resources upfront to get it going, you’re not going anywhere. Towards that end, one of the ways of getting connected with the capital you need is through venture capital firms - small groups of individuals who get together and invest in startups that they believe have a high potential for growth.   Currently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has fewer regulations and reporting requirements for venture capital firms with 100 or fewer members. This bill would simply increase that number from 100 to 250.   One of the hallmarks that makes America great is that people get to choose what they do with their own money and what risks they take. Venture capitalists are for the most part wealthy and sophisticated investors...they’re fully aware that 8 out of 10 startups fail within the first 18 months, and I don’t think they need the government looking over their shoulders.   Given the fact that new business creation is at a 40-year low, I think this bill will help strike a better balance between free markets and the federal government’s role in protecting consumers. Accordingly, I voted “yes.”","status",NA,NA,39,6,7,1,0,0,0,0

It calls for an audit of the Fed, and its passage would be a remarkable step in the right direction towards promoting accountability in our nation's financial system.   A core principle of our republic that has been constantly defended since our nation's founding has been the notion of popular sovereignty, or the idea that our government’s authority comes from the consent of its citizens.

Executions were somber and a first hand reminder of how the authority of government could stretch even to the point of life itself.  In this regard, I’ve been struck by several stories, like the one in the The Wall Street Journal below, which set up an important question…..Who’s ultimately in charge of pulling the trigger?    There is no greater power by government. Life literally hangs in the balance. Does it not deserve checks and balances?  In 2013, President Obama restricted the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to locating terrorists to be assassinated by drone strikes, leaving it to the military alone to execute the “targeted killing” mission. Prior to 2013 and since the start of the war in Afghanistan, the CIA had been allowed to conduct these bombings with input and oversight from the president and his top advisors.   President Trump’s decision to grant military powers to the CIA raises red flags for me regarding the fundamentals of our form of government. Should the CIA be a paramilitary organization or an intelligence gathering organization when it does not have the transparency requirements assigned to other parts of government? Why is a top-secret intelligence agency running military missions on autopilot with little oversight by the White House and largely unlimited by U.S. law?   These are questions worthy of deeper review.  Our Founding Fathers were wary of concentrating too much control over the military in the hands of a single decision maker. They set up checks and balances and left with Congress the decision to declare war. These kinds of limitations are particularly important with the new and lethal technologies found in today’s arsenal.   The bottom line is that I believe deadly decisions are too profound to be made by a small number of unelected officials that are not held to even the level of transparency we expect of our military. I’d be curious to hear your thoughts.","link","https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-gave-cia-power-to-launch-drone-strikes-1489444374","wsj.com",135,83,41,5,0,2,1,6

In fact, last year about 40,000 people were denied boarding on an overbooked flight by the major airlines. That’s more than 100 passengers every day. On top of those, 434,000 travelers voluntarily gave up their seats in exchange for compensation. For me, those figures set up a question: Why aren’t the 40,000 on the voluntary side of the ledger instead? Why is anyone ever forced to give up a seat after paying for a ticket?     As with so many things, Washington doesn’t have all the answers here and can sometimes contributes to the problem. That said, allow me to offer a few thoughts…  On the surface, outlawing overbooking may seem like the simplest solution. Indeed, it might solve the problem, but at what cost? Many economists suggest it would result in empty seats and higher ticket prices across the board.   The more free-market approach fits with what we all know - that eventually, anyone would be willing to give up their seat if offered enough in exchange. You might not be willing to step off the plane for $200, but I doubt that would be the case for $5,000. Instead of physically removing people from their seats, all an airline has to do is offer a high enough bid. The only problem is that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) caps compensation for bumped passengers - a price ceiling that drives at least a great deal of the phenomenon of paying customers getting involuntarily bumped.   At the end of the day, business success is about making the customers happy. Regardless, Monday’s incident is an egregious example of tone deafness and mismanagement. Ultimately it’s a matter incentives - an issue of supply and demand...the price offered in exchange for the seat was too low.   My friend Stephen Moore's article below offers insightful analysis of the issues involved….","link","http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/11/opinions/united-airlines-overbooking-fiasco-simple-solution-opinion-moore/","cnn.com",104,45,18,0,0,3,0,6

Given that our national defense is one of the primary constitutional roles of the federal government, I think the larger notion to be considered here is that not all defense spending actually strengthens our national defense. Indeed, with reports of military equipment in shambles and soldiers raiding aircraft museums for spare parts, it’s not at all unreasonable for Congress to insist on oversight and accountability, and I’d submit that sound accounting practices are a vital part of that.  If you recall, back in December, the Washington Post published an investigative report revealing that the Pentagon purposely buried an internal audit exposing $125 billion in bureaucratic waste. That total amounts to nearly one-fourth of the Defense Department’s $580 billion budget (in 2016).   Once again, what retired Admiral Mike Mullin said comes to mind: “The most significant threat to our national security is our debt.” That’s why I’d suggest the same level of scrutiny should apply to defense spending as to every other area of the federal budget. Ultimately, transparency is key to making sure taxpayer dollars go where they’re needed most.","link","http://dailycaller.com/2017/04/07/senators-ask-mattis-to-finish-the-pentagon-audit-thats-25-years-late/","dailycaller.com",171,36,54,5,0,10,1,2

Interestingly enough, the toughest questions so far have come from Mr. Dasinger’s AP Government students...their engagement and command of current events was most impressive!  They would appreciate Hubert Humphrey’s notion that our “freedom is hammered out on the anvil of discussion, dissent, and debate.” Of course, being a representative is in large measure about listening, and once again, my general take-away is that kicking around ideas with each other is important for the ways in which it helps us all to put faces with other opinions and realize how the issues we’re debating impact people’s lives.   That’s why showing up to make one’s voice heard is so vital in a representative system like ours.

Such was the case earlier this week as we voted on H.R. 187, a resolution that would direct the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to send more robust food assistance to the nation of South Sudan.  As tragic as circumstances are there, I would have voted no if this bill were about the appropriation of new money. This was not the case; this bill was about directing money already committed to be spent in the food aid account. Given the humanitarian needs there versus other parts of the world, I voted yes, and the resolution passed on Tuesday by a vote of 411 to 2.   Nearly $2 billion is sent every year in foreign food aid to countries around the world. As helpful as we would like those actions to be, tragically in many cases, the best of intentions ends in muddled results - or even works against helping those most in need. In short, humanitarian aid in some cases doesn't end where we want it to or helps to keep in power some who have created or added to the crisis at hand.  For example, in Zimbabwe, where just last year the U.S. sent $66.5 million in aid, over ninety percent of the country’s national budget goes to public sector salaries, leaving few resources for investment in infrastructure or public health. The dictator there, Robert Mugabe - a man who spent nearly $1 million on his own birthday party in a country where one-third of the children are stunted due to hunger - has essentially been given free reign to sidetrack U.S. aid to his own pockets. He is the fourth longest serving dictator in the world.   In Nigeria, where we sent $155 million last year, rampant government corruption caused by the rise of the Boko Haram Islamic extremist group accounted for millions of dollars in stolen humanitarian food aid. I could go on, but the point is that foreign assistance to Africa will oftentimes have serious and unintended consequences.   The famine in South Sudan is not a result of drought but rather armed conflict. After a political crisis sparked violence in the capital in 2013, thousands have been killed and millions of people have had to flee from their homes in just three years. The government of Sudan has agreed to open a humanitarian aid corridor through South Sudan that will reduce opportunities for the warring ethnic factions to steal U.S. aid. And when those affected by this conflict flee to the relative safety of the United States and United Nations aid corridors, I think this aid vote  represents the best of the available bad choices in helping people in need in both this conflict and in the allocation of the food aid account.","status",NA,NA,54,47,11,4,0,0,1,2

It came in reaction to the president's decision that same day to lift the ban on drilling along the Atlantic, and the bill would suspend oil exploration activities off the East Coast for the next ten years.   There have been a series of moratoriums on Atlantic drilling that have been put into effect by both Republican and Democratic presidents. They were in place because of the very strongly divided beliefs of so many along the coast on whether or not drilling fit with local control, tourism and environmental risk weighed against what most engineers suspect would be at most a four month supply of oil reserves.   The issue for me has ultimately always been about local control. If you really believe that the government most local generally governs best, then locals should indeed have some degree of authority in determining what happens in their backyard. This has never been the case on this drilling matter. Washington would decide what happens in the waters beyond the three-mile mark - which happens to be well in sight of Hilton Head, Folly Beach, or the Isle of Palms. None of us as locals would have any say in whether or not we look to an unobstructed ocean horizon or one with platforms a little more than 15,000 feet off our coast.   More to the point, the issue has never been about what was or wasn’t offshore - but rather the infrastructure onshore necessary to support offshore operations. This was always the tipping point for me in this debate. If industrial capacity is necessitated in Port Royal or Calabogie Sounds to support what’s happening offshore, shouldn’t people who live close by have a hand in indeed determining the way their neighborhood develops?   This is federalism...a thought central to conservative philosophy...and viewed as critical by the Founding Fathers to hold back a federal government’s bias to encroaching on the decision making of state and local governments. For those of us leery of unilateral control by Washington, we should be leery of this one - regardless of one’s views on oil and offshore.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/videos/651969335012851/",NA,181,96,51,15,1,0,0,6

This one will take us through the end of the federal government’s financial year, which is September 30. With this dealt with, it seems that there has been a refocusing on the healthcare debate, and that vote may well come up on Thursday.   Accordingly, I’d like to dig into the latest iterations of where things stand on the healthcare debate and my views on it.  The issue has picked up again with the acceptance of Congressman Tom MacArthur’s amendment to the so-called “manager’s amendment” of the American Health Care Act.   To start, I continue to be impressed and struck by the intensity of people’s heartfelt feelings and beliefs on this vital subject. In many ways, there is nothing more personal than one’s healthcare. People have gone out of the way to tell their stories and to point to children or loved ones who have been helped very directly by the Affordable Care Act. On the opposite side of the equation, I’ve heard from any number of small business people who are struggling to pay the rising premiums in the individual healthcare marketplace. Over the course of my eight town hall meetings, I have overwhelmingly heard from people who believe in either a single-payer system or maintaining the Affordable Care Act in its present form.   The difficulty I find in maintaining the status quo is that it is unsustainable. Premiums cannot continue to go up by 30%, as they did last year in our state. In the same vein, people really don’t have insurance if their deductible is well beyond their means to pay for it. Finally, when choices continue to constrict, one ultimately sees availability affected as well. We are down to but one provider in South Carolina.   So, we really are between a rock and a hard place in this debate.   On the one hand, you want to be attentive to the many who’ve come out and made their case for leaving their benefits alone. On the other, you want to be attentive to people who increasingly can’t pay for the limited insurance that they do have that often comes as a consequence of a deductible so high that insurance is effectively non-insurance, given people’s inability to afford it.    It’s for these reasons that in the first round of this debate I staked out a “no” position. I am one of only three Republicans who actually voted no on the bill. I did this as it came through the Budget Committee and then subsequently whipped no on the bill that was to have come up weeks ago.  These efforts combined with the position of others led to the bill being pulled...and consequent great criticism, and even threats in some circles and praise in others.   As we’ve gone through this debate, I have learned a lot and have come to believe that we ought to, in a more transparent form, help those in need who draw a bad genetic card or find themselves dealing with the consequences of a horrendous accident. Concurrently, given that I believe in the marketplace, I have also come to believe that you should let insurance really act as insurance for the vast majority in the individual marketplace who find themselves without the tragedy of a horrific accident or a bad fate with regard to illness.   The individual marketplace makes up about 7% of our total healthcare market in the U.S. The Affordable Care Act covers about one-half of this population - 3.8% of the healthcare marketplace to be exact. Most people are served in group insurance. Medicare covers those above the age of 65. TriCare covers those in active duty. The VA covers veterans, while Medicaid has historically helped women and children of limited financial means.  The vexing question in this debate revolves around how we as a society do three things concurrently: 1) lower premiums (insurance must be affordable to be available), 2) maintain a patient’s right to have choice (on the most difficult of personal decisions, who wants a government or insurance bureaucrat to decide whether to turn off the life monitor for a grandparent in life’s last hours?), and 3) protect those who draw a bad genetic card through no fault of their own (we aren’t a third world country that leaves people to die on the side of the road...people with no insurance and no ability to pay for coverage are admitted to emergency rooms based on federal law - but the rest of us pay for them).  I believe the bill Senator Rand Paul and I offered solved these problems of cost, access, and choice...but it is not the bill we might see on Thursday.   But some of what I have struggled with is still tied to what the Senator and I were trying to get to: how might we induce more people to get insurance? And how does that coverage hold when one has indeed been dealt a bad and expensive condition in life? The Affordable Care Act was well intended and attempted penalty as its way of getting more young people to join the insurance ranks. Instead, millions of young and healthy people believed it was in their best interest to pay the penalty and not enroll. This meant the Affordable Care Act may have been well intended...but it was also financially unsustainable.   The MacArthur Amendment is not a cure-all, but I do think it strengthens the bill enough in protecting those with pre-existing conditions that if it came to the floor in original form, and were combined with an amendment to prevent Congress from exempting itself from the bill, I would vote yes. This would simply advance the debate to the Senate where I think the bill's prospects are even tougher than they were in the House.  Here is my take on that amendment and what it might mean.  In attempting to strike some sort of balance between protecting those in need and letting insurance be insurance for those without the bad genetic card, it would allow for the Founding Fathers’ belief in a federalist answer to divine these fairly unnavigable waters. Think about that for a second. The Founding Fathers began our country when it consisted of only about 4 million people. That’s smaller than the state of South Carolina. I was once governor here, and we live in a state where if you don’t know everyone, you know of somebody who can get you to the person that you don’t know. Yet with a population this small, the Founders built federalism in a big way into their belief on the proper balance of government. As our population has increased to the tune of hundreds of millions of people, this idea of federalism becomes that much more important. Washington might indeed know what’s best for a population as small as 4 million, it will never know what’s best in a population that includes the diversity that comes with hundreds of millions.   This at the core is what the MacArthur Amendment employs. It says if Vermont wants to have a single-payer system and the costs that are associated with that, it can choose to do so. Concurrently, if South Carolina wants to have a more market-based system, they can do that as well. We can literally have a competition of ideas and see which ones work best.   The amendment didn’t stop there though. States would only be freed of things like community ratings, essential health benefits, and age banding if they set up a risk pool modeled after Maine’s successful program. What does this mean? One, no one could be denied coverage for a pre-existing condition based on guaranteed issue which is built into the bill. Two, no one could be charged more for health insurance based on a pre-existing condition as long as they indeed stayed enrolled in insurance.   For folks that disregarded even this requirement of continuous coverage, they too would be protected. For their state to have exempted itself from the community ratings, which could drive prices higher for someone with a pre-existing condition, the state would have had to set up a risk pool. Not just any risk pool, because some states set up disastrous risk pools under the Affordable Care Act, but one initially modeled after Maine’s. Theirs required a cross-pollinating fee from the healthy to those who ended up sick. It was nominal, perhaps $4-5 a month, but helped to pay the cost of those less fortunate. These pools, at the federal level for the first three years and then subsequently at the state level, would serve as a final backstop in making certain that no one with a pre-existing condition was financially crowded out of coverage. There has been $30 billion allocated in this bill toward these pools.  I think this equation represented a win for those most concerned about the maintenance of our social safety net, while from a conservative standpoint, there were wins in the revised bill with the elimination of certain Affordable Care Act taxes coming a year earlier, work requirements, and the federalism model that made possible things like the Maine-style risk pools.   In this regard, the bill represents a tweaking of the Affordable Care Act. It does not eliminate it. It is not full repeal. It was at that point that a number of us stood in front of the Capitol and said we didn’t see it that way. We saw it as nothing more than a starting point. In many ways, it still is. All this means that parties on both sides of this debate don’t like it, and I think that’s generally a good indicator of a compromise bill. Though I would like to see much more in the way of change, it’s arguably the most we can get through the House at this point. It’s come a long way from what Speaker Ryan defined as a binary choice just a few months ago when he said it was this or nothing. That we had to take it or leave it.   As one of the holdouts on this bill, I have tried to look for ways of being something other than just “no” and to be constructively engaged in the debate. I also had to ask whether or not there was enough in the newest version of the bill to warrant advancing it to the Senate for further debate. In this case, I believe there is, which is why I’m staking out the position that I have.   If the bill as I know it now changes, or if the provision for congressional exemption are not to be removed...then my thinking on this vote would change accordingly. But until that happens, I wanted to let you know my latest thinking on both the amendment and the bill at large.","status",NA,NA,53,99,12,0,0,0,0,24

It says everything. In a House, Senate, and White House controlled by Republicans, there were only fifteen Democratic “no” votes for the omnibus bill.   You tell me who the bill most helped.  In fact, they say in politics at times you are known by the friends you keep. So, if friends to the bill in question include people like Nancy Pelosi, it should give a conservative pause.  In this regard today, Congress voted on H.R. 244, an omnibus spending bill that will fund the government through the remainder of the 2017 financial year, which ends on September 30. The bill did pass by a vote of 309 to 118. I was one of 103 Republicans who voted no, while 15 Democrats did the same. I’d like to take a moment and explain why I voted as I did.  First, a little background about why Congress is voting on funding for 2017 so late in the game this year….  Last December, Congress approved a so-called continuing resolution to keep the federal government running through April 28...last Friday. At the time, the presidential election had already happened, and candidate Trump had become President-elect Trump. In an effort to clear the way for the incoming administration’s legislative priorities, Republicans in Congress decided to put off fighting for a long list of conservative proposals in that continuing resolution. Instead, the idea was simply to bridge the government funding gap into the new administration, which would then author its own budget that would assumedly be much more reflective of conservative priorities.  We have now crossed that funding bridge. Unfortunately, the truly conservative budget that we were promised to find on the other side is nowhere to be found.  In general, this bill authorizes $1.163 trillion in discretionary spending for fiscal year 2017.   Think about it. In 2015, the deficit was $439 billion. In 2016, it increased to $587 billion, And this year’s projected deficit is $559 billion, based on the spending in the omnibus bill. One can not keep digging and get out of a hole….  Considering that our national debt is already projected to increase by approximately $10 trillion within the next decade - from an already astounding $20 trillion, this omnibus spending bill represents a step in the wrong direction. We desperately need to start closing the gap between our taxes and spending, not widen it, as this bill would do.  On one hand, this budget stays within the caps on discretionary spending set out in the Balanced Budgets and Control Act of 2015. But it’s fake. It’s gamed, given it includes a substantial increase in funding for Overseas Contingency Operations, or the war-fighting budget, which is not subject to those discretionary spending caps.  Once again, this omnibus spending bill treats the war-fighting budget as a way to circumvent the spending caps.  There are certainly valid arguments to be made in favor of increasing defense spending subject to the spending cap, which would require raising the cap itself. Those arguments deserve to be heard and debated by the full Congress. Using budget gimmickry to increase defense spending without violating the cap, as opposed to actually having that debate, is irresponsible.  A closer look at funding levels for specific programs reveals even more problems. The bill does not prohibit funding to Planned Parenthood or so-called “sanctuary cities,” which openly defy federal immigration laws. The bill does include funding, however, for questionable programs like the Orion Space Launch System and a new $323 million headquarters for the Federal Bureau of Investigations. It also provides nearly $1 billion for programs focusing on alleviating hunger in foreign countries, as opposed to hunger in our own country.  The omnibus makes permanent a temporary program enacted in the continuing resolution from December, which pays part of the cost of health insurance for former employees of mining companies that have gone bankrupt. In other words, this bill allows those mining companies to offload the responsibility of paying for benefits they promised their employees onto the federal government. Furthermore, the cost of the program is offset in the omnibus through increased customs duties on imported manufactured goods, thereby shifting the cost burden onto consumers who purchase those goods.   While there are a handful of positive aspects to this bill, they mostly have to do with what was left out. For example, a number of riders that would have weakened environmental protections were ultimately left out of the bill, which is encouraging. The bill also omits a proposed, drastic cut to the budget for the National Institutes of Health, which funds important  research on critical issues like pediatric cancer.  Also worth noting is the lack of funding for President Trump’s proposed wall along our southern border with Mexico. While I am in favor of building such a wall, I don’t think it should be done at the expense of larger budget deficits. An ideal solution would have been to include funding for the wall that was totally offset elsewhere in the budget.  In summary, there is simply more to dislike in this budget than there is to like. These omnibus spending bills are always a mixed bag, including concessions and omissions designed to garner enough votes to pass. What’s more, they are always very long, yet lawmakers are given a very short time to review them. This time, we were given only 62 hours to review a bill that stretched over 1,665 pages. This was not the truly conservative budget it was intended to be. Accordingly, I voted against it.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/photos/a.124615434414913.1073741828.118387985037658/652778734931911/?type=3",NA,125,114,71,4,1,4,5,47

Most significantly, it’s my hope that this will ultimately serve as a first step in the process of getting toward a sustainable healthcare system.

Despite all the hyperbole, ultimately the vote this week came down to one simple question: do we kill the bill and not let the debate advance to the Senate - or not?   In its original form back in March, my vote was that we do just that and not allow the Senate to debate the bill. The bill was rushed and not ready. With the three amendments that came in the wake of my and others’ efforts to shut down the bill in March, it’s my belief that it was at least worth letting the Senate debate the bill.  Let me explain.  I held eight town hall meetings over the last few months and have directly heard from so many at home who registered a whole host of grave concerns about what might come next in healthcare. I tried to take those concerns into consideration not only in March but with this vote.   It is for those warranted reasons that I was but one of three Republicans who voted no when the bill came through the Budget Committee in March and was subsequently one of the holdouts that caused the bill to not make it to the House floor.   But that is not where the bill ended.    Many Republicans will claim this bill eliminates the Affordable Care Act. These may be good talking points, but it’s not so accurate. It eliminates some portions of the Affordable Care Act and leaves other portions standing.   Specifically, the bill is predominantly about eliminating most taxes and penalties, and this narrow construct was driven by the procedure called reconciliation that required the bill to be budget neutral and primarily deal with budgetary issues. In its original form, the Congressional Budget Office scored the bill as saving a little over $350 billion over the ten year budget window. Since then, there were three amendments, but if they were to drive the bill from being a budgetary savings to a cost, the whole bill would be discarded based on budget rules.  The three amendments that came after the bill’s collapse in March were sponsored by Rep. Mark Meadows and Congressman Tom MacArthur, and these had further perfecting amendments that were offered by Congressman Gary Palmer and Rep. Fred Upton.   The first amendment by Meadows and MacArthur was designed to find some middle ground between conservatives and moderates on how we might allow different states to try different approaches in regard to healthcare. In short, it allowed Vermont to go to a single-payer system, if they so choose, and South Carolina to go to a market-based system. Protection for pre-existing conditions and allowing one to stay on their parents’ plan until the age of 26 were both attributes of the Affordable Care Act and built into the base bill. What was at question as a result of this amendment, though, was if a state opted out of part of some of the regulations in what’s called Title I, an insurance company could charge someone with a serious health condition more.   This is where the Palmer Amendment came in. If a state was to opt out, then they would be required to set up a high-risk pool in the fashion that Maine successfully did some years ago. The Upton Amendment added another $8 billion for high-risk pools on top of the $15 billion that came with the Palmer Amendment in addition to the $115 billion that came in the bill for states to use with Medicaid or indeed things like high-risk pools. .   In short, what the bill was trying to get at was striking some sort of balance between protecting people with pre-existing conditions and profound health needs while at the same time lowering the cost of insurance for the majority of people in the individual marketplace who do not have these same needs. These people have increasingly found themselves facing ever escalating premiums and dwindling choices, and this group has received surprisingly little attention in the debate of the last month - but they are important stakeholders in what occurs. In South Carolina, we are down to but one provider and premiums went up by 30% last year in the individual healthcare marketplace. In Maryland this year, premiums will go up by 60%. In Iowa, 94 of 99 counties now have but one insurance provider. Just this week, Aetna announced that they were withdrawing from Virginia, leaving 24 counties out of 95 counties with but one insurance carrier.   The long and short of all of this is that this bill represents an earnest, if rushed, attempt to protect people with pre-existing conditions while at the same time helping people who have seen dramatic increases in the cost of their insurance. It will certainly be my aim to look for ways to both protect people with pre-existing conditions or significant medical hardships while at the same time working to lower insurance premiums.   Given the perfecting amendments that have been inserted, I think that the issue is important enough to forward now to the Senate for their deliberation. I am quite certain the Senate will be even more conservative in their efforts to repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act, and if the bill actually moves through the Senate, it will come back to the House for yet another debate and vote before it could make its way to the president’s desk. In short, this bill’s passage means simply that you and I will be talking about this issue for months to come, and I earnestly look forward to those conversations and the learning that will come with them.","status",NA,NA,213,425,86,6,1,5,13,194

The bill passed by a vote of 229 to 197 with my vote.  Right now, private employers cannot offer paid time off as a way of “paying” for overtime hours worked; only overtime wages are allowed. This is the case even if the employer and the employee would prefer time off as the payment. In contrast, government employees have had this option for over thirty years. This bill would simply give private sector employees the same choice that federal workers now have.  Making sure to have a good work-life balance is a struggle for many who juggle the demands of the office with the day-to-day of family life.

I’d like to say thank you to Rep. Mark Meadows for cosponsoring the bill, particularly at a time when Washington doesn’t seem to be paying any attention to the ever-growing mountain of federal debt.  In that regard, I think it’s especially important to recognize the need for spending restraint right now, and this bill would return to Congress the process of setting the debt limit to a dollar sign instead of based on a date...which is how it was set historically.  Indeed, from World War II to 2011, Congress took specific votes on the debt ceiling, setting a dollar limit on exactly how much borrowing would be allowed by the federal government. But since 2011, the dollar amount has been replaced with a window of time and the debt ceiling increase since then has been based on the debt incurred during that period.  This about it this way: You lend a family member your credit card. On the one hand, you stipulate that they can only spend $500 dollars. On the other hand, you simply say that they can use it for the next two months. Which way do you think they would they spend more?  This process is backwards. Instead of allowing the debt to increase to a certain date, Congress should return to setting the debt limit to a maximum amount.","link","http://www.freedomworks.org/content/freedomworks%E2%80%99-bill-month-may-2017-debt-limit-control-and-accountability-act-hr-1529","freedomworks.org",68,29,9,4,0,0,0,2

Mr. Dodaro’s testimony was illuminating on a number of fronts for what it said about the Bible’s notion of trust in little before one trusts in a lot.   Most people I talk to want the government they pay for to work, and their attitude is why would I give you more if you are wasting much of what I already send you?  In this vein, his first point was about improper payments. These are payments the federal government makes for the wrong amount, or to the wrong person, or for the wrong reason. Since 2003, the government has made approximately $1.2 trillion in improper payments. Just in 2016 alone, 22 federal agencies reported improper payments across 122 programs, totaling $144 billion.   Let me say that again - $144 billion! In 2016 alone….  This is an astounding number. In many cases, this money went to people who were dead or the wrong person or in an amount greater than should have been sent. Even more frightening is the way in which they are largely isolated to a small handful of programs. Specifically, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Earned Income Tax Credit account for over 78% of these payments.    The second issue brought up during the hearing that I found interesting was the “tax gap,” or the difference between what the government is technically owed each year in taxes and what it actually receives. For example, from 2008 to 2010, the Internal Revenue Service collected an average of 84% of expected tax revenue, creating an annual tax gap of 16%, or $406 billion.   To be sure, a simpler tax code would result in a smaller tax gap. Our current tax code is more than 76,000 pages long, 100 times larger than it was one century ago. Making taxes easier to understand is a step toward making them easier to pay. Closing the tax gap is also important from a budgetary standpoint. Congress uses projections of expected tax revenue as a basis for decisions on spending and the debt.    Both of these items - improper payments and the tax gap - represent opportunities for deficit reduction that do not require tax increases or spending cuts. Instead, they represent opportunities for the government to save money simply by doing what it already does, just more efficiently and with fewer errors.","status",NA,NA,45,55,20,2,0,4,1,6

I found it striking that Republicans control the House, Senate, and White House, and we still ended up with the spending that was contained in it. Yet leadership and the White House claimed that that bill represented the last vestiges of the Obama Administration and that the next budget would be different.   That brings me to the next budget.   The budget process has begun in earnest in Washington, and I wanted to give you a little context as to what’s happening in the debates that are now quietly taking place…but that will soon be elevated to a much larger public debate.   The Budget Resolution for fiscal year 2018 is a document now being crafted and will serve as an instruction manual for the committees that determine exact funding levels for specific programs.  As we begin that process, it is important to understand the lay of the land...in terms of the problems this budget and future budgets must address as well as the political pressures that will surely influence its final structure. Budgets effect everything government does, and so they are often arenas where conflicting agendas collide and unrealistic promises are exposed. There are countless numbers of players on this field, and all of them want the ball for themselves.  One major player in this process, obviously, is President Trump, who has proposed increasing defense spending by $54 billion next year with a corresponding reduction to non-defense discretionary spending. Both sides of the discretionary budget have been cut significantly in recent years. So while the president’s proposal would bring welcome relief to our military community, it would tighten the squeeze on the non-defense discretionary budget even further.  On one hand, this give-and-take approach would keep total discretionary spending underneath the level currently permitted by spending caps established in the 2015 Bipartisan Budget Act. On the other hand, subjecting the non-defense portion of the discretionary budget to a 10% cut all in the next year is something congressional appropriators, regardless of political affiliation, may balk at.  So, just to recap, providing our military with a funding increase is a worthy and appropriate goal, as is off-setting that increase with savings elsewhere in the budget. Finding those savings in the non-defense portion of the discretionary budget, however, might well prove politically impossible. So, what is the solution? How do we thread this needle?  The answer just happens to be the 800-pound elephant in the room: mandatory spending. Of the $3.85 trillion our government spent last year, only $1.18 trillion, or just over 30%, was discretionary spending. Apart from $240 billion paid in interest on the national debt, the rest was mandatory spending, which is not subject to the annual budget and appropriations process. To use a somewhat tired phrase, this spending is more-or-less on “auto-pilot.” It is also dominated by only a handful of programs. Spending on Social Security and major healthcare programs, for example, accounted for more than $2 trillion in spending last year.   Perhaps precisely because these programs are not subject to the annual budget and appropriations process, it is mandatory spending that will primarily drive the growth of our budget deficits and national debt over the coming decades, specifically spending on Medicare and Social Security. While the discretionary portion of our budget has been held down, the mandatory portion needs reform, and there are things that we could do that would not interrupt payments to current retirees.   For example, in 2016 alone, the Department of Health and Human Services reported improper payments related to either Medicare or Medicaid totaling $96 billion. These are payments made either for the wrong amount, to the wrong person, or for the wrong reason. If we prevented just over half of those improper payments from being made in the first place, the resulting savings would fully offset President Trump’s requested funding increase for the military.  I realize that this is all a lot of Washington inside-baseball, but here’s the point. If we want to meet President Trump’s request for defense spending in 2018 yet remain committed to the difficult but necessary task of reducing our future budget deficits, most likely the only viable path forward will involve savings in mandatory spending.  Exactly how we traverse that path will be a matter for debate, both in Washington and in town-hall meetings across the country. I sincerely look forward to having that debate, as it is one I have worked on for many years. For now, though, the important thing to keep in mind is that the mandatory spending portion of our budget will be where any serious attempts at reducing our budget deficits and national debt might be made. Whether or not the Budget Committee and Congress choose to do so remains to be seen.","status",NA,NA,58,100,12,2,0,0,6,9

My’Asia is a senior at Cane Bay High School in Summerville, and her piece (seen below) is entitled “Centenary 1947.” The subject’s name is David Fladger Richardson, originally from Centenary, South Carolina, and he now calls Summerville home. The tobacco farm in the background of the picture is where he lived and worked as a boy and on into his teen years. He is part of the greatest generation, and as a Korean War Veteran and Bronze Star recipient, I can only imagine the stories behind his eyes and weathered skin.

In terms of activity and hours spent, that’s the equivalent of the entire state of South Carolina doing nothing but working on their taxes for the next 2 ½ months.   So, how does that translate over to dollars and cents? The costs of compliance - the time, effort, and money expended to simply make sure that taxes are filed correctly - is as high as $1 trillion a year...or in other words, about $3,200 per US citizen. This amount is on top of the $3.4 trillion in federal taxes that American citizens and business will pay this year.

But a long list of folks have asked my opinion of the latest claims with regard to possible leaks of classified intelligence by the president.   If they are true, they are more than distressing.   But in the back and forth that surrounds these press accounts, I’m not certain of what’s fact or fiction, so I don’t think that I can credibly comment on the validity of the claims themselves. What I can comment on is that there is a pattern of casualness with regard to what and how the president says things and that this casualness is dangerous in our form of government. Free societies are composed around trust and reason rather than intimidation and force - and to advance ideas in a free society requires trust. The president’s legislative agenda is put at risk not only by stories like this one but by tweets when not supported by facts.   In short, I believe what I tell my boys all the time: words have consequences, and the bigger the hypothetical consequence of words or actions, the more they should be measured.   I guess all this can be best summed up with what’s said in the Book of James.

An economy’s ability to grow is roughly limited by the number of people working and how much economic output each of them produces on average. The combined growth rate of those two factors - labor force size and labor productivity - determines an economy’s potential growth rate under ideal conditions of full employment and maximum efficiency of labor.   And why does this matter?    Today, the White House unveiled its budget request for fiscal year 2018, and it assumes an annual GDP growth rate of 3% over the coming decade.    If we get that number, all is good. If we don't, we are left with big budget deficits.    I would argue this number is unrealistic for a number of reasons. But, for now, let me give you just one point on growth itself. The Congressional Budget Office projects a potential economic growth rate of 1.8% per year. This figure reflects the sum of projected annual growth rates for the labor force, 0.5%, and for labor productivity, 1.3%. Achieving a sustainable rate of economic growth significantly higher than 1.8% would therefore require an equally significant increase in the growth rates of either the labor force or labor productivity...or both.   On the projected growth rate in our labor force, the downward trend observed over recent years will prove difficult to reverse. Ten thousand people a day are retiring in our country as the baby boomer generation continues to retire.    It would take a near magical transformation then in our labor productivity to boost overall economic growth  - and that is what this article shows is difficult.    Take a read - this point will prove to be a very important one in the debate ahead on the budget.","link","https://www.wsj.com/articles/labor-force-stands-in-way-of-trumps-3-growth-goal-1494861153?mod=nwsrl_u_s_economy","wsj.com",59,29,7,0,1,0,1,1

It’s important in that it’s tied to what I believe would be a $2 trillion deficit hole, if we build a budget based on numbers that aren’t real.    Part of being conservative means using numbers that are real. It means conservative or realistic forecasts of what might come down the road as opposed to the rosy scenarios oftentimes laid out by government officials...that then don’t turn out, and as a consequence, each of us as taxpayers are left holding the bag.   In testimony, I applauded the OMB Director for the fact that the president’s budget actually proposed balance - as you may remember, the former administration proposed budgets that never balanced. I also applauded the fact that they proposed real cuts. The Appalachian Regional Commission has done much good for many people but was created at the height of our nation’s depression and in many ways has outlived its original purpose. I could give other examples, but all too few in Washington propose real cuts. This budget did.    My problem, though, is that it also proposes that the economy will grow by 3% over the next 10 years. I will make it a point over the days ahead to send a number of reasons as to why that can’t be. I would love for 3, 5, or even 10% growth to occur...but wishing it so doesn’t make it so. We have to base our numbers on the real things now occurring in the economy, and one of the big drivers of what’s happening with our growth is tied to the 10 thousand people a day retiring in our country.   I won’t say more, but do take a look. I’d love to get your thoughts.","link","http://money.cnn.com/video/news/2017/05/24/mulvaney-sandord-3-growth-assumption.cnnmoney/index.html","money.cnn.com",94,65,22,3,0,0,1,6

Here’s another reason why the 3% economic growth the OMB Director defined as foundational to the president’s budget does not make sense.    Three percent growth in the economy would require productivity growth more than double current projections and at a level never sustained over any decade in modern history.    The closest our country has come to this level of productivity growth came between 1958 and 1967 in the final wave of electrification and with the completion of the highway transportation system.    Would you bet the farm on this happening again over the next 10 years? Particularly given that if you’re wrong, we add more than $2 trillion to the national debt?    In fact, if our productivity growth rate rose to the level of the 1990s, we would achieve only one-quarter of what would be necessary to achieve 3% economic growth. This is particularly a problem when the RAND Corporation estimates that productivity growth will decrease by 15% over the years ahead based, on our country’s aging. On this one, I’ve got to go with the Rand Corp because, as much as I’d like to work until I’m 90, physical realities begin to set in that would drive me toward less work.

It’s hard to believe that Blake joined our family over eighteen years ago, and now we’re to the point of him leaving the nest this fall. It’s bittersweet. On the one hand, at the head level, I know this is what’s supposed to happen, and I’m excited about his movement in life. At a heart level, I’m conflicted, given he won’t be there most weekends as a best buddy to head down to the farm.

I would pass on but two encouragements.    One, recognize that graduations are milestones. They’re a chance to stop and to smell the flowers, rejoicing in the day...while at the same time reflecting on its meaning and what it means in life’s next step. The military does a very good job with promotions and retirements in the way that they stop and reflect on what a team member has meant to that team. For each of you as graduates, do make it a point in life’s many passages to stop, pause, and reflect. It was Socrates who said that the unexamined life was not worth living, and these pauses create inflection points to indeed reflect on whether or not what you’re doing now is really what you want to be doing, and where you think your talents might best be used in this precious journey called life.   Two, habits matter. If one brushes their teeth on a daily basis and makes it a habit, you can expect to get fewer cavities. A graduation suggests that a number of worthwhile habits have been instilled, and my simple point here is that I would continue to add to your list of life affirming habits. They will pay great dividends, and this graduation shows an early sign of their taking hold.    Back to the issue at hand for me and our family, though!   ...which is that I wish Blake the absolute best as he goes off to Georgetown University this fall. You’ve made your entire family most proud of the young man that you’ve become and the habits that you’ve instilled.

For college graduates, that means new beginnings, as they find their footing in the “real world” and enter the workforce. And for many, it will mark the beginning of the process of paying back those student loans. In this vein, a recent report from the New York Federal Reserve sounded yet another warning with regards to the long-term effects of student debt, which now totals $1.3 trillion - up 170% from just a decade ago.   So why does this matter? One reason, according to the Fed’s report, is that those with a significant amount of student debt are less likely to own a home at any age than those with little or no student debt.  This is important for the ways in which your home is not just something that you buy…but it’s one of the most crucial ways you can accumulate and store wealth. In that regard, homeownership has, in many ways, been a cornerstone of the American economy over the years.   Given the fact that the American taxpayer is on the hook for these student loans should they go south, it’s worth noting that our best and brightest are increasingly saddled with student debt and its effects will likely be far-reaching.

It’s called the Highway Restoration Act of 2017, and it’s meant to direct more money to building and maintaining the roads and bridges we all use. The legislation simply requires that for users of the trust fund to take from the trust fund they must put money into the trust fund.  Could there be a simpler concept?   If you don’t put into the pot, you can’t take out of the pot. Most people I talk to tell me this fairly well describes their notion of a trust fund. Money from a specific source, dedicated to a specific use, that can’t be touched for something else.   Yet this is not the case in Washington or Columbia. And if we end up with leaky buckets, you can put all the new money you want into the system and you will still have problems.   In this bill’s case, it simply works to make sure money in the Highway Trust Fund goes towards its intended use: highways. Every year, US citizens pay $40 billion annually into the Highway Trust Fund. As its name suggests, it was created to pay for highway upkeep and funded through the federal gas tax you pay at the pump. However, about $8 billion of the Highway Trust Fund is pushed into the Fund’s Mass Transit Account and used not on highways - though mass transit pays not a penny into the fund.  Keeping a trust fund a trust fund in this instance is important first in terms of simple fairness - a trust fund is to be used on what government promised it would be used for. Its also important though financially. The Highway Trust Fund is going broke, and its monetary issues are not helped by the redirection of money to the Mass Transit Account. The Fund has historically spent more on infrastructure projects than it receives in revenue. This, in turn, has led to Congress needing to bail out the Fund to the tune of $139.9 billion since 2008. This is simply not sustainable and why I introduced the Highway Restoration Act.","status",NA,NA,105,50,17,2,0,2,0,0

That simple precept is too often lost in Washington but has much to do with why government waste bugs people as it does. The people I talk to don’t mind paying for government that’s effective or efficient...but what they well know is much of government is not. As a consequence, they have little interest in paying for more. In this vein, let me highlight two things I have been reviewing with others members of the House Budget Committee GOP as part of the process of building the budget for 2018.   Improper payments.    These are payments the federal government makes either for the wrong amount, to the wrong person, or for the wrong reason. Since 2003, the government has made approximately $1.4 trillion in improper payments. Just in 2016 alone, 22 federal agencies reported improper payments across 122 programs, totaling $144 billion. Considering that five agencies failed to report any improper payments in any of their programs last year - including the Department of State and the Department of Energy, the actual total is likely much higher.   These payments are largely isolated to a small handful of programs. Specifically, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Earned Income Tax Credit account for nearly 75% of these payments.    The second item is the “tax gap,” which is the difference between what the government is technically owed each year in taxes and what it actually receives. On average, the Internal Revenue Service collects 86% of expected tax revenue, creating a tax gap of 14%. Last year, that equaled $406 billion.   To be sure, a simpler tax code would result in a smaller tax gap. Our current tax code is more than 76,000 pages long, 100 times larger than it was one century ago. Making taxes easier to understand is the same thing as making them easier to pay. Have you seen those surveys they do? They gather one hundred tax professionals, or even IRS auditors, and when asked to prepare the return...get one hundred different answers?!    Both of these items - improper payments and the tax gap - represent opportunities for deficit reduction that do not require tax increases or spending cuts. Instead, they represent opportunities for the government to save money simply by doing what it already does, just more efficiently and with fewer errors. That should be something the government pursues irrespective of the size of our debt and deficits.    I encourage you to check out the article linked below, which includes an audio clip from a C-SPAN interview with a top official from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), Christopher Mihms. Mr. Mihms came and spoke about these same issues to the Budget Committee.

The chart on the left depicts the age distribution of our population in 1980. At the time, a large portion of our population was relatively young and just beginning to enter the workforce en masse. This explains the robust growth rate of our labor force seen throughout the 1980s and 1990s.  The chart on the right depicts our population as it was in 2015. As you can see, the large chunk of our population that was just entering the workforce in 1980 is now beginning to make its exit. As that happens, it will push our rate of labor force growth down instead of up, which will ultimately limit the rate our economy can grow going forward.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/photos/a.124615434414913.1073741828.118387985037658/665604516982666/?type=3",NA,27,20,5,0,0,4,0,1

Yet the Founding Fathers were consistent in laying out their belief that civil liberties - and the privacies that are contained in it - were fundamental components of the larger issue of freedom that they believed in.    One really can’t have liberty living in George Orwell’s world in ""1984."" In this book, he talked about a Big Brother government wherein government literally watches everything we do. It’s for this reason that we consistently have to watch the issue of civil liberty. In many cases, this form of liberty falls as a casualty to the current war on terrorism. Law enforcement can always do more in tracking people, but it’s got to be limited to what the Founding Fathers prescribed in their belief that there had to be a warrant or a reason and probable cause for the infringement of our rights on this front.    All of this is relevant because a federal court in Ohio decided last year that police could demand cell phone location data (cell phone tower pings) from your cell carrier without a warrant.    This issue will now go to the Supreme Court. For the sake of Fourth Amendment privacy protections, I hope the Supreme Court does create a warrant requirement in such instances.   Regardless of what the courts decide, Congress can take a stand and actually create law requiring warrants in this instances. Congressman Jason Chaffetz has done just that in introducing a bill that would add such a warrant requirement. Today, I cosponsored his bill.

The #Comeyhearing was certainly the center of the political universe today.    I would just make three observations.    One, it’s important that Congress do the basics of what Congress has to do. A legislative body can be sidetracked, and if we don’t watch out, this one will be. I talked to a friend back home who expressed dismay with the way in which Washington was seemingly fixated on the sensational that seems to be driving aside changes on things like spending and tax policy that really impact people’s lives. I would in no way diminish the significance of truth in the White House. Nor would I set aside questions with regard to what some would consider an attempt to obstruct an investigation. But as real as those issues are, it is paramount that the work of Congress go on. We have representative government for a reason, and those differing viewpoints are to be infused into legislative ideas that bring about remedy and changes that matter in people’s lives.   Two, today’s hearing was a reminder of how much truth and trust really matter. It’s important in a family. It’s important in a community or a church, just as it is in business. And most of all, it’s important in the public domain where people literally trust in others their ability to have a voice in city halls, state capitols, or even Washington. In the hearing, what came clear was that Comey has a version and Trump has a version. The two versions don’t mesh. I suspect many people will see the version that they like or believe in based on partisan terms, and ultimately this shouldn’t be the way in which we decide the truth. Our republic depends on people having a level of trust in one another, and the hearing today underscored the degree in which much of that has been lost. This phenomenon is very dangerous in our form of government.    Finally, the hearing probably raised more questions than it did answers. Different camps will take their differing views and make arguments going forward based on the soundbites that best fit with what they may believe. It’s very weird that a outgoing FBI director would leak documents. That’s distressing for the way that it is so far from the standard that people believe in with regard to law enforcement or the judiciary. The same could be said of the president dining alone with the person overseeing investigations surrounding the president’s team and, in that environment, the president allegedly asking for an oath of loyalty. That seems hardly the time nor the place, and one has to ask why a chief legal counsel or chief of staff wouldn’t counsel against that type of visit, if even only to prevent the appearance of impropriety.    So I’m left with a host of questions and a bit of distress on the larger picture in which we find ourselves. It’s vital that Congress find a way to move forward on a legislative agenda and in addressing budgetary and debt issues before us. It’s equally important that the truth be found on the differing allegations that are out there, and it’s my hope that over the weeks and months ahead the committees of jurisdiction will be able to do just that.","status",NA,NA,53,63,14,2,0,1,2,2

It’s one of those things that you may see in the distance, but as you approach it, it seems to disappear.    This in large measure was the essence of the thinking behind this week’s vote in the House on H.R. 2213, the Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017. The bill would help streamline the hiring process for the United States Customs and Border Protection Agency. I voted for this bill, which passed 282 to 137, because it’s a bipartisan, commonsense solution to a problem of the government’s own creation.    In short form, here is the problem this bill addressed. Customs and Border Patrol has not been able to hire enough agents on occasion because they could not clear security requirements on a timely basis. The catch is that these prospective employees had already done so! They were former members of the military or of law enforcement who had gone through polygraph tests and more...but federal requirements in this instance would require them to go through the whole process all over again.    Think about it. In life, we try and avoid doing things twice. It costs more. It takes more time. And both those commodities are precious.    Why not just do things once?    That’s what this bill did. It modified the Anti-Border Corruption Act of 2010, mandating that all applicants be subjected to a polygraph test so that people who had already done this in the military or law enforcement would not have to do this again. This bill gives the Customs and Border Protection Agency temporary authority to grant a waiver from the polygraph test requirement for federal, state, and local law enforcement officials, as well as members of the armed forces and veterans, who have already passed polygraph tests and background checks for their previous position.   I also think it’s important to note that, because this bill includes a built-in expiration date of five years, it can be considered a trial run, more or less. If it doesn’t work, we can simply let it expire. Let’s hope it does, though, because for all of the technological and physical barriers we construct along our nation’s borders, none of them mean much without an actual, well-trained human being there to stand watch. Therefore, I voted in favor of its passage.","status",NA,NA,74,40,9,1,0,0,0,0

Unfortunately, that’s not been the case recently with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) deciding to ignore more than 120 municipalities, including every single coastal municipality in South Carolina, who have all formally opposed oil and gas development off the Atlantic coast. Locals should indeed have some degree of authority in determining what happens next in their communities because the onshore infrastructure necessary to support offshore operations is considerable.    That’s why I recently introduced the Coastal Economies Protection Act, and just yesterday, more than 60 local groups - including Oceana South Carolina, Don't Drill SC, Conservation Voters of South Carolina, Coastal Conservation League, Lowcountry Local First, South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, South Carolina Wildlife Federation, Sierra Club of South Carolina, and Don't Drill Lowcountry - came out in support of the legislation, which would suspend all oil exploration activities off the East Coast for the next ten years.

Likewise, a manager’s ability to change their organization ultimately comes down to their ability to change personnel.   In that vein, the House voted today on S. 1094, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017, which will make it easier for VA officials to fire or otherwise discipline employees found guilty of serious misconduct. This bill, which passed 368 to 55, is similar to another bill called the VA Accountability First Act, which the House passed back on March 16th, but with some slight differences that required another vote in the House. If I could, I’d like to tell you why I voted for both bills….   In April of 2014, a retired VA employee came forward with accusations that senior managers at the VA hospital in Phoenix had instructed their staff to maintain a secret list of patients waiting for appointments...for the purpose of artificially lowering the reported average wait time. Sadly, the incident at the Phoenix VA proved to be only the tip of an iceberg.   In response to the unfolding scandal, Congress passed a comprehensive VA reform bill called the Veterans’ Access to Choice and Accountability Act in August 2014. That bill included a provision granting the Secretary of Veterans Affairs expedited authority to demote or fire senior-level employees for poor performance or misconduct. Today’s bill would expand that authority to cover all employees at the VA. It dramatically shrinks the timeline for appeals of disciplinary actions and prevents employees whose cases are under appeal from receiving pay, bonuses, or other benefits. Employees who are found guilty of a violation could be forced to repay bonuses or relocation expenses and could even see their retirement benefits reduced if convicted of a felony.   This bill differs from the March bill mainly in that it formally establishes a new Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection, which was created on a temporary basis as part of a bill passed last September. This office will handle all internal whistleblower tips, and it will also oversee the implementation of future reforms to the VA system. In addition, this bill maintains certain aspects of the existing process for appealing disciplinary decisions, pursuant to a May 9th decision in the United States Court of Appeals, while still subjecting the process to the new, shorter timeline.   Ultimately, this bill is about spending resources at the VA in a better way. It is a bipartisan, commonsense solution that will result in our government spending our tax dollars more efficiently as well as better care for our veterans. I therefore voted in favor of its passage.","status",NA,NA,58,55,3,2,0,0,0,2

That’s not true. The assertions were based on an interview I did earlier this morning with Joe Scarborough, who I once served with in Congress.    As too often is the case in the world of politics, people will grab a portion of a phrase and use it to the effect that serves their purpose. This is the case with these headlines.    Given the friends that did call, I’ve included the clip below from another interview that I did a few hours ago with Craig Melvin. I’d ask that you take a look. Once again, we talked about the tragedy that occurred yesterday and what I see is the degradation of civil debate at all levels of our society.   There’s plenty of blame to go around. At some level, we’re all to blame. Some would say that Obama let people down, based on the way in which he was to be a great uniter...and proved to be less than that. Others would blame President Trump for some of the things that he has said over the course of his campaign and time in office. Still others would focus on the way in which people in politics have said awfully rough things about each other of late.    So the bottom line is this: too often, people want to blame somebody else for what we can all have a hand in fixing. The main point of the clip here is that while different people, including the president, have said some things that strain this notion of civil discourse - it’s up to all of us to look for ways of being more civil to each other.    Take a look, and let me know your thoughts.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/videos/671447623065022/",NA,302,990,106,16,2,10,8,124

More broadly, I have a thought or two on civility in general, given its importance and the ways in which it’s vital to the workings of an open government and free people.   Toward that end, I’ve included below another video clip. This one was recorded last night with Anderson Cooper 360 on CNN while at the Congressional baseball game. I would ask that you take a look and that you forward or email, this text and clip to a friend who may have questions about what I said yesterday.   The dust up came because of the way some commentators and press outlets chose to make it sound like I blamed President Trump for the tragic shooting that took place in Washington. I did not. I was talking about civility in the public realm and how he, and every one of us, has responsibilities in what we say and how we say it. But to be clear, there was only one shooter on Wednesday, and only one person pulled the trigger. We don't all own horrendous outcomes.   Civility in the way that we engage with each other is certainly a part of growing up Southern - but more broadly, it’s part of growing up American. Unlike so many other places in the world, where people will not tolerate a differing viewpoint, our Founding Fathers enshrined their belief in the significance of open dialogue with the first of our American rights. In our country, we can say what we believe, and this is a privilege relative to so many other places in the world where this is not the case. But with every right comes a responsibility. To carry on our tradition, there has to be some degree of measure in what we say and how we say it. It’s for that reason that the Bible says in Colossians 4:6 that our conversation should always be filled with Grace. The Founding Fathers had many thoughts here, and even the Supreme Court has said that we can’t yell fire in a crowded theatre because of the way that words could cause harm in that instance.   The points in all of this are several fold:   One, American politics has always been contentious. We wouldn’t want it any other way, as we are the Land of the Free and we hold our views strongly. But we’ve also always been able to separate the sin from the sinner. In this equation, we were able to separate the person from the ideas they held. Doing so is vital to a healthy debate whether that’s at home, in business, or even in the body politic. Ideas are not us; they’re ideas. Some are big and some are small. Hopefully most of the ones we debate in public forums are of scale and much bigger than any man or woman - which makes it that much more important that we separate personalities from ideas. It has to be about an idea - if we are really going to debate the idea. What I have seen of late is a degree of personalization and demonization of differing viewpoints that is dangerous in our form of government. What I hope the tragedy of the day before yesterday did was to focus all of us on how dangerous it is for anyone to be so incensed in their politics that they take it to the point of wanting to shoot people who hold a different view.   Two, knee jerk reactions are dangerous. We have to find a better way of listening rather than reacting. Steven Covey once wrote of the importance of seeking first to understand before we try to be understood. Matthew 7 conveys the same idea as it talks about taking the log out of your own eye before you worry about the splinter in someone else’s. Social media has been dangerous on this front for the way that people feel free to very quickly react before they gather all of the facts or even choose to measure their words.   Three, truth matters. It matters for all of us. I believe that there is objective truth. It’s important in a reason based society that we listen to what the Founding Fathers talked about when they talked about unassailable truths. The president has been fast and loose with some of his facts and that’s dangerous, just as it is that the media will combine a few different thoughts - regardless of their context - and try and create a great headline whether it fits with reality and truth or not.   Finally, as I stated in each of the three interviews yesterday, it’s important that we all do our part in returning civility to the public sphere. Too often here, people seem to think that two wrongs make a right. Someone told me that Snoop Dogg [whoever he is] had done some skit where he pointed a gun at the President’s head and that Madonna had said something awful. We need to call them out on it. The same is true whether it’s school, the workplace, or the local bar when we hear something that just doesn’t pass muster with regard to some measure civilized engagement.   My worry here is that if we don’t get ahead of this thing, tribalism in the way we debate can lead an open society to very dangerous places. Tribalism, I would define, is not debate about ideas but rather nothing more than the law of the jungle and my group against yours in the way that we express ourselves. If my team says that it’s okay, it's okay. If your team says it, it’s wrong. This is not the reason based society that we inherited from our Founding Fathers, and my fear is that if the economy were to turn down - which I believe it’s due to do - these sentiments can become very strong. There was a great book written years ago titled Popular Illusions in the Madness of Crowds, and it talks about this very phenomenon through the ages. These sentiments become especially heightened when people’s basic needs are not being addressed and this often happens with economic downturns.   The long and short of all of this is that it is my prayer that the tragedy that occurred in Washington this week will serve as a catalyst to more thoughtful engagement in the world of politics from all its participants - elected leaders, the media, and in even each of us as voters. We can make it so….one person at a time.","video","https://www.facebook.com/AC360/videos/10158971493375533/",NA,223,440,0,25,11,3,5,118

Neither are good choices for the taxpayer living in South Carolina.   In that vein, I wanted to tell you about two bills the House voted on last night. They would in part affect our nation’s foster care system - but much more directly, they would affect the balance of power between Washington and the rest of the nation. While they were well intended, I voted against both of them with a handful of other Republicans because they fell on the side of Washington deciding yet more in our lives. The first bill replaced state judgment with federal control, and the second bill expanded a welfare program with no consideration of cost.    The first bill, H.R. 2866, the Reducing Barriers for Relative Foster Parents Act of 2017, would pressure states to change their foster care laws to mirror a new federal model developed in Washington.     Laws and regulations governing foster care have always been within the jurisdiction of state governments. It's important we leave it that way. While the federal government monitors the activities of each state’s Department of Child Protective Services or Human Services, it does not dictate things like standards for foster home licensing. Do we really need these things decided in Washington?   This bill would do that, which makes it awfully tough for those of us who believe in the Tenth Amendment to our Constitution. As you may recall this amendment says “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.”    State licensing standards for foster homes reflect the reality and needs of foster children in each state, and imperfect as they may be...I think it's important to not have them preempted by licensing requirements from the federal government that would prove to be equally imperfect.   The second bill, H.R. 2847, the Improving Services for Older Youth in Foster Care Act, would allow former foster children to receive benefit payments until age 23 and educational vouchers until age 26...up from the current ages of 21 and 23, respectively.   Most everyone I know would agree that helping foster children wherever possible is a good thing, but it ought to be done within the context of cost. How much more would it cost to add these additional benefits?    The answer here is that we don't know, and until we do...I don’t think it’s wise to sign a blank check on what amounts to new entitlement spending. Furthermore, this bill uses budget gimmickry to hide an increase in spending. Under current law, funds that are allotted to states under the program but not spent must be returned to the Treasury. This bill would allow those funds to be redistributed to other states and spent instead of returned, meaning it will increase spending under the program without technically increasing its budget.   Again, both of these bills were well intended. But one expands automatic spending, and the other injects federal regulation where state regulations have historically existed. For these reasons, I voted against their passage.","status",NA,NA,99,77,11,1,0,1,1,7

The saying is that you can have all the money in the world, but if you don’t have your health you don’t have anything. I guess it’s for that reason that I have seen such strong emotions around this issue over the twelve town hall meetings that I’ve done in different shapes and sizes across the district. For that reason, today is a fairly charged day on Capitol Hill given Senate leadership released their healthcare proposal.    It’s only been about 4 hours since we received the text of the Senate’s bill - and the details of the bill are still being released - but here is a look at three things that I believe will drive the upcoming debate and my support, or opposition of it, in trying to represent you.   One, will we let insurance act as insurance? The House attempted to begin this process as they looked at things like “community ratings” and flexibility in the way that states allowed plans. At this point, the Senate does not allow this same flexibility in their bill and I think that’s problematic given the number of people I have heard from who feel that they have been priced out of the individual healthcare insurance marketplace. What we can’t have is insurance that is a mirage. You can get it, but you just can’t afford to do so.    Two, Medicaid expansion. The House began to end expansion at the end of this year while the Senate version would allow further expansions over the next five years. From both the left and the right, this will be a significant debate point. States like Ohio have expanded their Medicaid rolls and Republicans like Rob Portman, Lisa Murkowski or Susan Collins are leery of curtailing on this front. On the other hand, the system by any measure is unsustainable over the long run - and it’s indeed the long run that we worry about when it comes to entitlement programs. It’s not good enough that they’re around for the next five years, as many of us hope to be living well beyond that time period.    Finally, there is the question of subsidies. The House bill attempted to limit them to increases associated with the aging process. The Senate bill goes back to more of what was proposed in the Affordable Care Act in allowing income and other considerations drive this decision. As a practical matter, what this means in some cases is that able-bodied people of limited income are eligible - and given the fact that we have a finite number of dollars to deal with healthcare, this means that there could be less for people who have more pronounced healthcare concerns.    I will continue to keep you posted as things develop on this issue, but the bottom line is that I think these will be the three main debate points that surface over the next week.","status",NA,NA,148,223,29,0,1,3,3,32

This does not mean one cannot hold strong philosophical positions that are diametrically opposed to others on the other side of the political aisle - it’s just that there has to be a measure of civility in the way we iron out and raise those differences. At times, people figure there’s so much squabbling in Washington that nothing can get done.

The blindfold represents objectivity. Justice should be dealt from our courts objectively, without fear or favour, regardless of money, wealth, power, or identity. In her left hand, Lady Justice holds balance scales, which represent the weighing of evidence.  In this light, the Supreme Court today decided to hear the Trump travel ban case during their next term to determine whether the ban is constitutional. Whether one agrees or disagrees with this ban, it raises the larger question of impartiality in the way our court system decides things - and the degree to which we hold true to the objectivity our Founding Fathers envisioned for our courts.  I mention all this because I joined 57 other members of Congress on a letter that calls for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to recuse herself in the travel ban case based on her comments last year about then-candidate Trump. The letter is led by Congressman Ron DeSantis, and you can see it here.  What has occurred here has parallels to Attorney General Jeff Sessions decision to recuse himself from investigating Trump, given the fact that he is a Trump appointee. I was pleased with his decision and bringing in Robert Mueller, a former FBI Director under the Obama and Bush Jr. administrations, to independently investigate the matter.   Attorney General Sessions made the right call...step aside so as not to cast a cloud of doubt over any final decision. It’s with this in mind that I feel that Justice Ginsburg should do the same in the case challenging Trump’s temporary travel ban.   As a rule, Supreme Court Justices are supposed to recuse themselves when their “impartiality might reasonably be questioned” or where they have “a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.” Based on Justice Ginsburg’s past comments, it seems pretty clear to me that this criteria is met. During the campaign months, she said, “I can’t imagine what this place would be - I can’t imagine what the country would be - with Donald Trump as our president;” and on another occasion, she called him “a faker.” When thinking about the country under a Trump presidency, she said “I don’t want to think about that possibility.” Again, whether we agree or disagree with these statements is not relevant, but what is relevant is whether or not a justice who holds these views can be impartial in their decision making.  It was appropriate for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to step down in rendering judgement on Trump, and I think the same holds true for Justice Ginsburg.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/photos/a.422935127916274.1073741847.118387985037658/676636945879423/?type=3",NA,83,85,9,2,0,1,0,22

This is a big deal.   The decision by U.S. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt was significant ultimately not with regard to water and the environment - but with regard to control. To say that all intermittent stream beds of this country are jurisdictional waters of the United States is to turn upside down the idea of local control...and the historic nexus of federal control versus state control.

This bill provided legal reforms that were scored by the Congressional Budget Office to save $50 billion in federal healthcare cost over the next ten years.  The big question in this bill was whether or not there was preemption of state law. Initially, I thought there might be, and for this reason, I had planned to vote against it. I have always believed in the importance of medical malpractice reform, and it was with this in mind that I pushed for it as hard as I did during my years as governor.   But I also believe in the notion of federalism - that states are not wards of the federal government. Historically, issues like statute of limitation, contingency fees, or even joint-and-several liability have largely been the domain of state rather than federal government.   In many ways, these two bills represented a tug of war between these competing interests, and I have always believed that the greater of these interests lies in limiting the federal government and federal power. For that reason as mentioned, I would have opposed this bill, if it had been simply a contest of these two ideas.   What stood out though was language that was added to make certain that there was a nexus between federal spending and the spending control measures that were represented in the legal reforms this bill contained. This makes sense. One cannot say that they will disburse large amounts of money and then cede to states and localities all control for the way in which there might be accounting and judicious measure in how that money is spent. Think about that for a moment. The federal government should not tell states and individuals how to spend their money or how awards and settlements should be made within the state court system...but if the federal government puts great amounts of money into the healthcare system, wouldn’t it seem logical that the programs that use federal dollars have some degree of control on costs. So in this bill, the caps that it establishes on non-economic damages do not apply, if there wasn’t federal money involved in the healthcare that led to the malpractice suit and court action.   There are a whole host of other technicalities that you could discover on this bill that could be found here on this House Judiciary Committee document, but for the time being I just wanted to get back to you on my reasoning on yesterday’s vote.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/photos/a.124615434414913.1073741828.118387985037658/678359315707186/?type=3",NA,14,25,3,1,0,0,0,0

Kate, as her friends and family called her, was killed in San Francisco by an illegal alien who had been deported five times. He was released by San Francisco police after they refused to honor a request from federal authorities that he be held for an outstanding drug warrant.   I bring this up because last week the House passed a couple of bills that would go a long way in preventing such a tragedy from happening again. I voted in favor of both and would like to tell you a bit more about these two important bills….  The first bill was H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. This bill allows federal agencies like the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security to deny sanctuary cities access to at least four grant programs designed to support law enforcement efforts. More specifically, the bill clarifies U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer authority, which allows immigration officials to pick up illegal aliens from local jails. Also, the bill includes Sarah and Grant’s Law, which demands that illegal aliens arrested for a variety of serious crimes be detained during removal proceedings.  Past administrations too often looked the other way when cities like San Francisco refused to apply federal immigration laws. This does not make sense. You and I don’t get to pick and chose which laws we will abide by. I disagree with the amount of taxes I have to pay...but until we change the size and scope of government and the laws that go with it, I am not given licence to not pay them because I disagree with them. That is what the body politic is for...changing what we don't like...and defiance is not the body politic. Law enforcement and the law are to be universal - with equal justice for all. It can not be enforced in patchwork form and still have affect. To do so moves us against the very design of the Founding Fathers - which was that there should be limited government, but the government and law we had would be blind and impartial in the way it was administered.   The second bill was H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law, named after Kate Steinle. This bill would increase maximum jail times for illegal aliens who have been convicted of serious crime, deported, and then return illegally to the United States. It also makes it harder for people deported from our country to challenge previous removal orders. The principle here is the same: for laws to have meaning, there must be consequences for not adhering to them.","status",NA,NA,193,72,25,12,0,0,5,23

If you haven't done so, now is your time to make your voice heard.   Regardless of where you stand on the issue, it's worth commenting. Because this indeed is your time to vote.    One of the reasons I believe this issue is so important is because our Founding Fathers believed each one of us had a far better understanding of what was best for us and our communities than a king or Washington. That's why they believed in local control and voice - that not all decisions needed to be made in Washington.   Determining how the coastline of South Carolina develops is a decision that should be made by South Carolinians living on the coast not unelected, or elected, officials in Washington. In this case, what happens offshore will have mighty impacts on what happens onshore along the coast.   It's for that reason I have been vigorous in my opposition to offshore drilling and seismic testing and introduced the Coastal Economies Protection Act - which would place a 10-year moratorium on oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic.

In part, the blessing of life was to be indeed treasured because life in this world was limited and finite.  And while we may know this intellectually, sometimes life's many chapters are hard to accept at a heart level.  Such is the case for me this morning.  My mom died at about 6 am.  She was at the farm, surrounded by family. She was 93 and an incredible lady.  I speak often of my dad and his influence in my life, less so of my mom...but on this occasion let me say the obvious...she had no less hand in blessing and guiding my life. She was the steady and constantly nurturing and supportive force in the family, and I know I join each of my siblings in awareness and thanks for what that meant.  She was radiant in her joy for life and warmth for others.  Among her many accomplishments - Fulbright scholar and more - by far her proudest accomplishment was her family. She lived for it and showed us the way on what joy in real love and sacrifice really looked like.  It's frightening to think of the number of meals cooked, sheets washed, corners cleaned, diapers changed, bedtime prayers made, Boy Scout, cross country, football, soccer and track meets attended, school functions....times one thousand other things that went into building the lives of me and my three siblings, her 12 grandchildren, her many friends...or any of the 1,000 people we all brought back with us to the farm over the years!  In short, her efforts, her love and zest for life, her warmth, her smile, and much more will sorely be missed by all who were blessed to know her.  So, as I too frequently do, let me leave you with a thought...well actually in this case two.  One, if yours are still with you...hug your parent today. Express how much they mean to you. Though I am fiercely independent and a conservative, I don't buy into the fiction of the self-made man. Every one of us gets a critical hand at multiple points in life, by a loved one, a good friend...or even a chance acquaintance. To say the obvious, the greatest of hand ups and sacrifices made for most of us are by our parents. Look for a way to say thank you. On a day like today, I am thinking on how I could have said this more often and more clearly.  Two, hug your siblings. There can be all sorts of dynamics here, some good...some not so much so, but bottom line is that they are the longest riders in sharing this journey called life. No one will know you longer. My siblings and I had a powerful conversation this morning about mom and life and more, and the obvious hit me in how much they mean to me.  My sister has been especially strong in helping mom through life's last chapter. If you see Sarah, pat her on the back...she has been remarkable in the way she has lived sacrifice, care, and love to mom.  My sister also made me cry last night when she told me she had whispered to mom that there was an incredibly handsome young surgeon waiting to greet her at the gates of heaven. Indeed my dad was, and long has he been waiting.  We will all be there soon. Godspeed to mom until we meet again. Godspeed to each of you on this day....","status",NA,NA,470,387,112,131,0,1,223,0

It’s a thought worth pondering, considering the fact that the fastest growing part of the federal budget is interest payments. The Congressional Budget Office projects that in 20 years, 1 in 5 taxpayer dollars will go towards paying interest on the national debt.   Washington has a tendency to underestimate the cost of legislation. Example: Medicare originally was projected to cost $12 billion by 1990. In reality, the cost was $107 billion. Rarely does proposed legislation actually cost what was projected. But part of that is because cost estimates provided to Congress don’t include projected interest payments. The economic reality is painfully clear to those who have ever used a credit card. You may be able to rack up charges on the card, but at the end of the day, you’re paying for those purchases plus interest. Taxpayers account for this in their day-to-day life and so too should the federal government.  It’s been said that quality information leads to quality decisions. Particularly on issues related to the debt, deficit, and government spending, Congress needs to be making better decisions with taxpayer dollars. On that front, my colleague Congressman Dave Brat introduced the Budgetary Accuracy in Scoring Interest Costs (BASIC) Act, which I gladly cosponsored earlier this year, and what the bill does is simply require that interest costs be accounted for in all legislative cost estimates provided to Congress. True to its name, this bill is a basic yet fundamental step in the right direction.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/photos/a.124615434414913.1073741828.118387985037658/684276541782130/?type=3",NA,35,37,11,2,0,0,3,6

She was in Washington to strongly oppose seismic testing and offshore drilling in testimony before the House Committee on Natural Resources and dropped by my office for a visit afterwards.  Her dedication to protecting our coasts, our tourism, fishing, and recreation industries was moving and indeed heartfelt...and backed by many communities along the Atlantic.   Indeed, she is yet another voice rising up against expanding offshore oil and gas production in the Atlantic - along with 126 municipalities along the East Coast and over 1,200 local, state, and federal elected officials.

I thought about many things and under the category of less important in the framework of eternity but still important in the here and now - let me return to the notion of civility and its importance. George Washington said, “Every action done in company ought to be with some sign of respect to those that are present.” In the same vein, John F. Kennedy observed that “civility is not a sign of weakness.”  In any public forum, you can’t fix a problem without talking about it. Come to think of it, you can’t fix something in your business, your church, or even your home without talking about it. Can you imagine if the way you solved a problem with your spouse or child was by beginning the non-discussion with a lot of yelling and accusation? I doubt there would be much reception for whatever it was that you had next to say...and there’d be even less in the way of results in fixing the problem that had at least created part of the frustration you considered worth yelling about.   The life coach Stephen Covey wrote a book titled “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,” and he laid out as one of its central tenets the idea of seeking first to understand before attempting to be understood. The Bible says it a little bit differently when it talks about treating others as you would like to be treated. And I think it was Benjamin Franklin who dubbed this The Golden Rule.   In short, a little civility and a little grace in the way that we can choose to hear others goes a long way.  I return to this subject because at the beginning of last week I was on a flight up to Washington, and after we landed and began to collect our things, some guy three rows back (who was clearly not from back home) began yelling at me. What followed is a reminder of how each one of us can do our part in creating a little more civility in our neighborhoods and in the body politic.   There was a really neat guy in the aisle behind me who kept me engaged in conversation and kept saying to me: “you do not need to respond to this; you focus on your conversation with me.” He was gracious in the way that he decided to make himself the distraction from what was going on a few rows back. At the same time, several other passengers began to be rather direct in asking this gentleman to quiet down and to remember that there were children on the flight. Someone a couple rows ahead of me even broke the mood with humor as he yelled out to passengers in the plane, “welcome to Washington, DC.”   That little vignette that started my week in Washington was a reminder to me of how we’re all indeed responsible for some of the breakdown in what has occurred in civil discourse - and how all of us can be part of its cure. It was also neat to see the way that people can stand in the breach...how each person can do their part in diffusing or quieting situations that can get a little rough and loud.   Finally, it came as such a contrast to what I’d experienced over last weekend with my mom’s death and in her ultimate funeral on Thursday. She was indeed a gracious lady who lived civility in the way that she approached her loved ones - as well as people of all walks of life. In this regard, I wanted to write to not only thank my fellow passengers who interceded on last week’s flight to DC but to also thank the many people who have been so gracious in the messages they have left here on Facebook, in cards, in person, in email, and over the phone as well.   I’ll leave you with one last datapoint on this front. Last Monday, before I came up to Washington, I had a number of speaking engagements and office hours at several spots in the district. I was doing office hours in Bluffton at the True Value hardware store in Buckwalter, and who should walk in but George Kanuck. George is a former head of the Democratic party in Beaufort County and has been at times a strong critic of some of my views. He walked in, and as we shook hands, he said simply that he had come by to say that he was thinking about me and the family in the wake of my mom’s death.   He didn’t want to talk politics or policy, he just wanted to express his feelings of empathy for my loss. I was moved by his action. It’s a reminder of how, though we may disagree in our politics or our ideas, it is vital to find ways to build bridges one person to the next and to show civility in the way that we at times agree to disagree. So George, thank you for your kindness.   Those are my thoughts from the weekend…. I hope yours was a good one.","status",NA,NA,429,109,31,51,0,0,8,0
"RepSanfordSC","118387985037658_687506038125847","Congressman Mark Sanford","2017-07-18","2017-07-18 23:06:43","Under the category of catching up, last week the House voted on H.R. 2810, the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). I voted for the bill, and it passed 344 to 81. More than anything, it represents a vision statement on the configuration of our military, and given its importance, my bias is to support these bills when I can.  This is not to say I didn't have reservations. As is the case with most large authorization bills, there is a mix of good and bad, and accordingly, I would like to explain my reasoning on this bill.    The sequester has disproportionately affected our military. It was, in fact, viewed as a nuclear budget tool that was never to be used. But it was, and there has been real effect. Accordingly, this bill would allow for 42,100 more active-duty troops, 8,800 more reserve troops, and 12,900 additional members of our National Guard compared to last year’s NDAA. Troop levels across the military were reduced 7% each year between 2013 and 2016, leaving the Air Force at its smallest size in decades and the Marine Corps with troop levels that were described by the Marine Corp Commandant last year as crossing the “red line.” The boost to troop levels included in this bill will bolster readiness and ensure that the military does not have to rely so heavily on Reserve forces in the event of a new conflict. This is significant, given the way in which the operations tempo in many units has affected recruitment and reenlistment.   There is a much larger question to be asked in why we deploy some of these troops to the places that we do, but given we are still asking them to go - we should not force families apart for multiple deployments over short periods as our way of getting there.   An additional component of harm to our military rests in the way that unfinished congressional budgets and the sequester have derailed a number of much needed modernization projects. This bill attempts to bring greater stability and predictability to the process. This is true for desperate weaponization programs that stretch from disparate programs like the Army’s fleet of Abrams tanks, Air Force maintenance facilities to service the new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, or even things like the THADD and Aegis missile systems.   This bill also focuses on space. Your strength always comes with accompanying weakness. And given America’s absolute dominance in using things like GPS to target weapons and troop movements, our adversaries and competitors have increasingly focused on space as a point of vulnerability. Donald Rumsfeld tried to add focus to our military here, but 9/11 came along...and it has been deferred over the ensuing years.   Finally, this bill said nothing about a new Authorized Use of Military Force (AUMF) for the war on terror, which was disappointing. Our military is still operating under the AUMF passed more than 15 years ago in the wake of September 11, 2001. This is an issue that I have called attention to several times in the past, most recently by becoming the first and only Republican cosponsor of H.J.Res. 100, offered by Congressman Adam Schiff, which would replace the old AUMF with a new one focused specifically on defeating Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and the various branches of the Islamic State. Thanks to an amendment offered by Congressman Tom Cole, this bill now requires the President to submit a new plan for defeating those groups to Congress within thirty days of the bill’s enactment. I firmly believe the current AUMF does not provide such authority, which I expect this analysis will eventually confirm.   As for my concerns, the biggest was over how this bill might affect our budget deficits for the next few years. This bill authorizes a $65 billion spending increase above the existing cap on base defense spending. The bill also authorized $74.6 of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) spending.   We continue to spend more than the combination of a host of competitors, and better spending what we have will be part of the process that ideally comes with the more systematic approach outlined in this bill. We can't have start and stop on weapon systems and have efficiency.  This said, how we pay for this increase in defense spending above the existing caps has been the main snag holding up negotiations over the House Budget Resolution for 2018. I believe it still has a long way to go.   In an effort to improve the bill, I did offer a few amendments. The first, which was adopted, would require the National Guard to track the total cost of flyover missions at large public events. Currently, the military only notes the cost of fuel used in these missions. In reality, however, there are other costs, for things like maintenance and personnel. These missions are paid for out of the National Guard’s training budget.  Another amendment I offered would have ensured that men and women in the military are subjected to the exact same physical performance standards for a particular job. Women perform a host of very important functions in our military. Their role in no way should be diminished. But for the elite combat teams, like SEAL Team 6, unit cohesion is in part based on whether or not I really believe you can carry me out if I’m wounded. If I weigh 220 pounds as a man and you weigh 120 pounds as a woman, I don’t want gender norming to drive your ability to participate in the unit, if that gender norming means that I am going to be left behind if shot. The House Rules Committee decided not to make this amendment in order...or in other words, it decided that the amendment could not proceed to the floor for debate or a vote. Normally, the Rules Committee will do this when it feels an amendment is too controversial.   Finally, I decided to withdraw an amendment that I offered last year on this same bill. My amendment would have undone a provision that severely limits the selection of running shoes available to new military recruits. I still believe this is very important, but in fairness to the process we began with my amendment debate last year, I am willing to give the process a little more time.   More specifically, when the provision was created last year, there was one only shoe company (New Balance) that could fulfill the provision’s requirements, creating a de facto earmark. The provision required that recruits be given shoes that are made of components that come from within the United States. Shoes are not military secrets. We should give recruits choice in things that matter to their training. Prior to last year, new military recruits were allowed to purchase their own running shoes from a wide variety of choices, and soon they may just have just one.  While this may not seem like a big issue, switching from the cash voucher system that allows recruits to pick the shoe that fits them will cost taxpayers hundred of millions of dollars a year, and multiple studies conducted by the military, (including a 2014 study in which the Army monitored the running habits of more than 1,000 lieutenants) have shown that as running shoe options decrease, injuries increase.   Although I feel strongly about this issue, I ultimately decided to withdraw the amendment to give my colleagues on the House Armed Service committee an opportunity to fix the problem created by last year’s bill. Although my amendment didn’t pass last year, it did at least result in the implementation of a two-year moratorium on enactment, so more competition and choices can be brought into the mix. If it appears there may still be a lack of serious competition going forward, I plan to re-offer my amendment, perhaps as soon as when the House considers the military funding bill.   Besides my own amendments, there were a number of other amendments considered that I’ll run through in another post, so stay tuned.","status",NA,NA,49,28,7,0,0,0,0,1

Again, I missed them because I was in Beaufort for my mom’s funeral, but I thought I owed you an explanation on these amendments that I found more controversial or more difficult to understand.  Rep. Jared Polis offered an amendment that would have reduced the bill’s total funding level by 1%. I vote in favor of amendments to reduce spending, but in this case, I would have voted against this amendment because of the way the cut would be achieved. In the past, I have voted for 1% across the board reductions that would be managed by Congress. Rep. Polis’s amendment, however, would allow the President to cut whatever he or she wanted so long as the cuts add up to 1% of the budget. The Founding Fathers intended for only Congress to have the power of the purse and the ability to make decisions in spending your money. We should not cede this authority. This amendment ran counter to this premise of constitutional authority, and for this reason, I would have voted against it. The amendment failed 73 to 351.  Rep. Tom McClintock offered an amendment that would have allowed the Pentagon to explore the possibility of another round of military base closures, often referred to as a “BRAC.” The last round took place in 2005, and since that time, several branches of our military have reported excess capacity in terms of bases and other facilities. The Army, for example, reports that approximately 21% of all its bases are no longer needed. The underlying bill would have prevented the Defense Department from even conducting the preliminary studies that identify unnecessary bases and opportunities for consolidation and cost savings.   Many contend that the last BRAC round was less than perfect, and there were certainly things that could have been done better. However, in South Carolina, we actually added 700 jobs during my tenure as Governor as a result of the 2005 BRAC round. We shouldn’t let the perfect be an enemy of the good, and it seems reasonable to conduct the due diligence necessary to see whether the result would be a net-positive or net-negative for the country overall. I therefore would have voted yes on this amendment, but it failed 175 to 248.   Rep. Vicki Hartzler offered an amendment that would have barred military doctors from performing gender transition surgeries. I would have voted for her amendment. My vote on this amendment would have come down to keeping the military focused on the mission at hand, both in terms of personnel and funding. Readiness is a concern that I hear about frequently in discussions with military officials from all branches, and accordingly, Congress should avoid doing anything that unnecessarily diverts focus from what I believe should be the focus of the military...the ability to win wars. The amendment failed 209 to 214.  Rep. Tom Rooney offered an amendment that would have allowed service academy athletes to push off their military service duty and instead pursue professional sports careers. You get a free education paid for by the taxpayer and then get to walk from the commitment made by each of your fellow cadets? Earning the opportunity to play professional sports is indeed a tremendous and rare accomplishment, but athletes who choose to go to service academies do so with the full understanding that they will be cadets or midshipmen first, athletes second. I therefore would have voted against the amendment, which failed 107 to 318.   I was able to make it back to Washington for a handful of other amendments, and I highlight two in particular.  An amendment offered by Representative Franks would have directed the Department of Defense to officially study how Islam is being manipulated by extremists to further their terrorist agenda. It was well meaning, and I admire Tent Franks and the spirit of his amendment. There is a clear connection between radical Islam and terrorism, but we already know that. In fact, we know it all too well, and I think we should be careful of multiple studies of something we know.  In this instance, I also think it is telling that a number of members with military or other relevant backgrounds also voted against this amendment. For instance, Rep. Steve Stivers served in Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, and Djibouti as Battalion Commander and received a Bronze Star for his valor during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick was an FBI agent focused on counter-terrorism and in fact worked in Iraq before his election. Rep. Steve Russell was an Army Ranger and served more than seven years overseas in Kosovo, Kuwait, Afghanistan, and Iraq.   Each of them is in no way frightened of calling an ace and ace on perpetrators of wrong, but they also join me in being leery of painting with too broad a brush in looking for the cause of wrong. In this regard, while I believe the link between a distorted view of Islam and terrorism is something that must be dealt with, I was concerned the language of this amendment ventured a little too close to suggesting that Islam was the cause of wrong. I voted against this amendment, and it failed 208 to 217.  Rep. Doug Lamborn offered an amendment that would relax oversight of missile defense procurement. In terms of inefficient military spending, missile defense systems have a particularly bad history. Over the years, many projects have been developed and funded halfway, only to be scrapped in favor of a newer technology or in light of a changing global threat landscape. According to a report published by the Government Accountability Office, of the 10 missile defense systems that were scheduled for testing in 2014, only four were tested, and the rest were canceled or delayed. That’s why a requirement was put in place to have the Secretary of Defense personally approve new missile defense procurement projects, verifying that they are indeed necessary and unlikely to be abandoned before considerable amounts of time and money are devoted to them. That’s just smart budgeting, which is why I voted no on this amendment. It passed 235 to 189.","status",NA,NA,51,33,5,0,0,1,0,1

Earlier today, I wrapped up hosting Neighborhood Office Hours on James Island and then headed out to Folly Beach to visit with Mayor Tim Goodwin to tour their beach renourishment project. But I wanted to take a quick break to share with you an interview I did yesterday with Liz Claman on Fox Business regarding the 2018 Budget Resolution that passed the House Budget Committee earlier this week.  Despite disagreeing with the spending plan laid out in this resolution on any number of fronts, I voted in favor of it for one simple reason: it is a vehicle for tax reform, which we haven’t seen in thirty years.

This is true in building a football team…are we putting more money into training, coaching, the field, or shoulder pads? This same reasoning applies with a family budget, a church budget, or even a narco organization out of South America. Where do I invest money to get the results I want to see?  If I were to grab your credit card and checkbook, I could find your priorities. It wouldn’t matter what you said, the proof would rest in where you chose to allocate your money in most instances.  All this is a long-winded way of saying that budgets are important generally and very important in Washington for the way they reflect our priorities as a nation.  For this reason, if there’s any way possible, it’s incumbent upon the members of the Budget Committee to get it out of Committee so that all 435 members of Congress can have their hand in the debate that surrounds this document that indeed reflects - or works against - what we believe should be our priorities. Unlike so much of what goes into Congress that becomes law, the budget does not. It’s a document of the House and Senate that is never signed by the President and, in that regard, for the most part is not binding in the way that actual law is. But again, it’s awfully important as a vision statement in suggesting where money should and shouldn’t go from Washington.   This year’s budget though has an added wrinkle because it is seen as the only way to bring about tax reform. Through a process called reconciliation, the budget could allow a 51-vote count in the Senate for tax reform rather than 60 votes. This by no means guarantees tax changes that we’ve not seen in 30 years, but it does substantially enhance the odds that it might come about.   In simplest form, it’s for these reasons that I voted to move the budget on Wednesday from the Committee to floor consideration. Aside from the importance of the floor consideration just mentioned, it’s my belief that meaningful tax reform is very important to making our economy more competitive.  This does not ensure, however, that I will vote for it on the House floor because there are two things that concern me about the bill. And let me explain them….  One, it allows Washington spending to continue to grow at an unsustainable rate. I have said many times that a day of financial reckoning is coming if we don’t get our financial house in order. This bill doesn’t get us there. To the credit of Republicans on the Committee, there was more talk about the importance of addressing our national debt and associated deficits than from the other side of the aisle, but I am concerned that even the cuts that are in this bill will be gained as this sort of budget makes its way through the process.  Let me explain. Several years ago there was a budget deal struck that set caps on what’s called discretionary spending. This includes federal spending on everything but interest, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The sequester - “the budget deal struck"" - was actually intended as a piece of financial armament that would never be used. The idea was that it would force reform to what’s called entitlement spending, which is the basis of our primary budget problems. In fact, it was used and inflicted what many considered to be draconian cuts to the military.  The premise of that agreement was that the priorities of both Republicans and Democrats would be harmed if entitlement spending was not addressed. That has certainly been the case over the last few years as the category of government called discretionary has been held constant while the rest of government has grown. If you move forward on a budget like the one advanced Wednesday, the uneasy budget truce of one-for-one trade off for Republicans and Democrats on spending priorities will be broken. Specifically, my concern is that while defense is increased to the tune of about $70 billion this year, and the rest of domestic discretionary  is cut by about $5 billion over the same time period, that ratio won’t stick. What this means in simple form is that defense would be added to in the House…but then the rest of domestic discretionary would simply be added back in the Senate so that you end up with no financial restraint in Washington, DC. The breaking of the sequester could yield a one-for-one increase going forward, and it should concern all of us that, in this instance, the budget might be used as the excuse to break what little spending restraint still exists in Washington.   My other concern is this: if we get tax reform, what kind of tax reform do we get?  Let me get a little technical for a second. The budget document requires budget neutrality in reconciliation. What this means is that what’s being talked about is not a tax cut, but simply rearranging the taxes that are now imposed in the American public. I don’t think most people know this, and it’s a big deal.  What you’d really hate to see is tax changes that increase the tax load for small business people...or me and you as regular tax payers. It was for this reason that I offered an eleventh hour amendment on Wednesday night. I’m very concerned about what’s called the border adjustment tax, given the confines of the way that a tax bill would now be set to move forward in this budget.   I’ll have many more thoughts on all of this, but for now I’ve included some of my comments from Wednesday night and would ask that you take a look at them....","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/videos/689215057954945/",NA,60,42,11,0,0,0,0,4

Sometimes this will please you, sometimes not...but the premise of representative government and our our Republic was based on this simple but powerful idea.   This idea of trying to just read the facts as they are fits with my calls a few months back on the budget assumptions used in formulating the executive branch budget this year. It wasn't about Trump. It wasn't about anything but the numbers. For this reason, I found it heartening that this month’s Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report on the president’s budget confirmed what I highlighted back in May during a House Budget Committee GOP hearing: 3% annual economic growth is simply unrealistic. In fact, it assumes that the stars perfectly align with regard to economic drivers.   Make no mistake, we can get to 3 percent economic growth….but that’s not the question. The question is can we get there and not have an economic slowdown in any part of the next ten years. The economic cycle is not dead, and I don't think any of us would bet our home on rosy assumptions. We should not bet the budget on it either, because if the growth ends up being the more modest numbers assumed by CBO, you and I as taxpayers are left with a $3 trillion budget hole.   Interesting to note is the record gap between between what the president’s team projects (3% growth) versus what CBO projects (1.9% growth). According to economist Chad Stone, former director of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, “the 1.1 percentage-point gap between the Trump forecast and CBO’s is the largest for which published CBO forecasts are available and is far larger than any gap since the Reagan-Bush era. Between 1993 and 2016, the largest gap between the Administration and CBO forecasts was 0.4 percentage points; the typical gap was less than 0.2 percent.” That’s the largest gap in the over 40 years since the CBO was founded.  Part of being conservative means using numbers that are real to more accurately forecast what might come down the road…particularly how taxpayer dollars will be used. As I mentioned in a post last week, Washington has a tendency to underestimate the cost of legislation and rely on rosy economic scenarios that make certain policies look better than they actually are.   In case you missed it the first time around, here’s what I had to say about the 3% growth assumption back in May….","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/videos/690115264531591/",NA,129,62,18,7,0,1,0,3

Today, we passed H.R. 3364, Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, a bill that would increase penalties against these increasingly dangerous nations. I voted in favor of the bill...which passed 419 to 3.  As a rule, I don’t like sanctions. Often, they hurt regular people just trying to work their way through life - and a bad government imposed on them through no fault of their own, while the elites of those countries are largely unaffected. But when actions become so flagrant that something must be done, I see these economically blunt tools as a last resort. Such is the case here.  For years, North Korea was considered little more than a hermit nation and was in many respects written off. But, as we have seen over the past few years, it is becoming a threat to the United States, as it continues developing its nuclear arsenal and is getting dangerously close to developing long range missiles capability. Just today, Kim Jong-un promised a nuclear strike, if it is threatened by the United States. Today’s bill would further restrict funding from reaching North Korea by restricting its supporters’ access to US financial institutions. North Korea is unpredictable and dangerous, and the magnitude of these sanctions accurately reflects this.   Iran was added to the state sponsor of terrorism list over 30 years ago and has not come off of it since. This is in large part because the country’s militant Revolutionary Guards Corps has provided direct support to the terrorist organizations since its creation in 1979. If this wasn’t bad enough, Iran has been developing a nuclear weapon program for years and recently pivoted to making ballistic missiles capable of carrying a nuclear bomb to countries on other continents. Perhaps the biggest threat Iran poses is to their neighbor and our close ally, Israel. On the human rights front, Iran’s record has been atrocious. The Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act would expand sanctions against Iran to counter its ballistic missile activity, weapons of mass destruction, and human rights abuses.   The bill hits Russia hard on a number of fronts too. First, the bill expands sanctions against the Russian Federation for starting a shadow war in eastern Ukraine. Additionally, it creates new penalties to combat hostile Russian cyber activities, attempts to influence foreign elections like the US’s, and cuts off foreign aid to nations that are assisting Russia in these activities. It also creates new sanctions in reaction to Russia propping up Syria’s Assad regime. While the bill does target the energy sector of Russia, something that is not inherently dangerous, it only prevents Americans from entering into energy transactions with people who are contributing to Russia’s involvement in Ukraine and investing directly in Russia for its energy pipelines.   Last, the bill gives Congress greater oversight authority if a future president tries to reduce existing sanctions. Two years ago, President Obama entered into the Iran Nuclear Deal, an agreement never ratified by Congress that was designed to lift Iranian sanctions. In order to make sure that another situation like this never happens in the future, particularly with Russia, the bill includes language that would require that any attempt to lift sanctions must first pass through Congress. Given that Congress grants the authority to the president to enact sanctions, it seems fair that Congress should have the final say as to whether they should be lifted. For all these reasons, I voted in favor of the bill.","status",NA,NA,134,53,19,3,0,0,1,8

Considering that it hasn’t been reauthorized since 2002, the Department is due for an overhaul of its programs to make sure it is running as efficiently as possible. But the more I dug into the individual sections of this bill, the more I was reminded of the old saying: “death by a thousand cuts.” It seemed like every other section of the bill, I came across something that perhaps alone would not be enough to tip the scales to a no vote, but when added together, I felt the right vote was no. Allow me to explain these problems….   One, there was a significant procedural concern. We voted only a matter of hours after final text of the bill (428 pages) was released, yet the House rules dictate 72-hours of review before a bill is considered, so members can actually read the bills before them. This is particularly the case when DHS hasn’t been reauthorized in 15 years. There is no reason we couldn’t wait a few more days to vote so that members have time to analyze and study this bill.    Two, this bill would add $19 billion to the national debt. Rather than looking for ways to do more with less, the bill sought to spend an additional $19 billion on top of current DHS funding. Here’s a breakdown of just a few areas where I thought each of us as taxpayers should be concerned:    The legislation creates and expands a number of wasteful grant programs. As an example, it authorizes an additional $110 million in grant money - and this is in addition to the $55 million already planned for this year for a grant program called Operation Stonegarden. While funding is supposed to aid local law enforcement with securing the southern border, investigations show it has actually been used to pay for nothing more than local law enforcement. To cite specifics, controlling crowds at parades and soccer games, escorting funeral processions, monitoring gun shows, and responding to noise complaints are all important functions of local law enforcement - but they are hardly part of efforts to control our border. Another unnecessary grant program would give $50 million to fund security costs at non-profit entities that DHS thinks terrorists want to target. Why your federal taxpayers should pay for the security costs of a non-profit is confusing to me.     The bill removes the cap on Secret Service spending for surveillance of a president’s “additional properties” - like President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Resort - has been removed. This is a commercial club, yet the taxpayer is now going to pick up the cost of security surveillance? More to the point, this is a blank check. All the Secret Service will now have to do is notify the congressional Appropriations Committee and whatever they ask will be spent. Previously, that number was capped at $200,000.   Historically, presidents have spent the vast majority of their “retreat” time away from the White House at Camp David in Maryland. There is a permanent security force there that is paid for through the Department of Defense. Camp David is also away from urban areas, making it easier to protect and thus less expensive. We should be careful when a new president elects not to use a presidential retreat the taxpayer has financed and paid for...should the taxpayer be required to pay for a second when the first is not used?  I also have a number of reservations in the way the bill criminalizes verbal threats against anyone protected by the Secret Service. This gets real murky real fast. Think about it. If someone threatens a member of Congress in leadership, it’s a criminal act, but when threatening a rank-and-file member, it's not? Should we take steps to further insulate members of Congress or the executive branch from the people they represent. Insults, jeers, and rants are a part of politics...with few exceptions could they never be counted as criminal acts. I don't think a new classification of crime is needed, considering there are already laws on the books that criminalize legitimate threats of violence….and they count for all of us, not just folks with Secret Service protection.   One last nugget on the civil liberty front. The bill would also allow Amtrak to use the federal government’s passenger verification systems that contains private information of US citizens. I am concerned about this, considering Amtrak is not a federal entity and operates for profit. Accordingly, I don’t think the government should be sharing your personal data with them.    Again, I wanted to vote for this bill. The Department of Homeland Security is in need of reform and reauthorization. But, these troubling provisions make it too difficult a pill to swallow.","status",NA,NA,125,56,19,2,0,4,3,0

As a result of our votes, the bill failed...but it is being brought back up again today. A little discussion…  Process matters. Big ideas, or those that directly affect our lives, deserve debate.  The bill was put up on Monday under what’s known as “suspension.” This expedites a bill’s passage to the floor and limits the normal inputs and debate that one sees...and should have seen in this bill. In exchange for the expedited process, the vote count must be higher. Instead of the normal 50% plus 1, bills under suspension require a ⅔ vote...and it was for this reason that the 10 votes mattered more than usual.   Our stopping the bill on Monday doesn’t end the debate, but it does cause the body to come back and actually give it the consideration and time that it deserved.  The bill authorizes funding for the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, the NSA, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and several other agencies within the intelligence community. A bill that affords agencies the capacity to monitor our lives and alter what we define as civil liberty is a bill that indeed deserves real consideration.  I remain concerned about the mass data collection still authorized under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and I voted against the expansion of data collection in the 2016 bill. More significantly, Thomas Massie and I offered an amendment that would reign in this authority. I subsequently co-sponsored the Email Privacy Act, which would require a warrant for law enforcement to access your email. Unfortunately, nothing has been done by the intelligence community to step back from where they were in data collection when I voted against the 2016 bill. As a consequence, I will vote against this bill not just for the process reasons that caused me to vote against it on Monday, but for the policy considerations that have everything to do with what the Founding Fathers enshrined in the Fourth Amendment.   This is an important theme that we should all think on. Liberty means more than just our physical security and freedom of movement. It also means privacy and the civil liberty that comes with it as we each personally live what we believe it means to indeed live the “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” that our Founding Fathers promised. People may be quite creative and individualistic in their interpretations of what it means to pursue happiness, but unless they’re breaking a law or causing harm to another in the public sphere, we should be very deliberate about curtailing our federal government’s ability to eavesdrop on our lives. This bill does not do so based on the Section 702 language that we were not allowed to amend in this bill, and consequently I will vote no.","status",NA,NA,57,17,11,5,0,0,0,0

He started work today as Chief of Staff to the President, and one of his first actions was apparently to request that Mr. Scaramucci leave his role as White House Communications Director.   Scaramucci lasted but a week but, in it, issued a strange number of threats and was widely criticized last week for his profanity-filled rant in a conversation with a New Yorker reporter.   I haven’t been looking for ways to be critical of the president, but when things are crazy and not working, it’s vital that we call an ace an ace. If not, under the category of deference and political support, one gives subtle acquiescence to operating styles that would be condemned in most any organization that exists in the First District. I spoke up most recently on this very point on Friday at the Caucus Conference in Washington.   Whether you’re a Republican and actively supporting the president or a regular citizen who simply knows that what goes wrong in Washington can have real effect to your life, Scaramucci’s actions were hurting all of us. That which was already caustic had moved to a rather epic level of crazy last week.   That’s why it was so important that someone step in on the administration’s side and begin the process of establishing order.

In all the activity of the day - it started with a breakfast early this morning and will wrap up as I speak to a group this evening in Summerville, one thing really stands out.   Scotty Parker and his story.  Too much of the news today is about the negative or what doesn’t work out, but his story is remarkably positive and none other than inspirational.   He is a 13-year-old Charlestonian who decided to make a difference by raising money for Water Mission. It started small when he was about ten and asked people to redirect his birthday gifts to instead be contributions to Water Mission. Apparently, he raised about $500 in that process. Then, he upped the ante and decided to ride a bike across the state of South Carolina to raise money for Water Mission.   Now, at the ripe age of 13, he’s just completed a 3,270 mile bike ride across the country and in the process raised $570,000 for Water Mission.   Ever wonder if any one of us can make a difference? Whether you’re too old or too young? Look to Scotty’s example for the answer to those questions.   I dropped by for his triumphant arrival back to North Charleston and the Water Mission facility this morning, and it was remarkably uplifting.   George and Molly Green themselves have done remarkable things in creating this charity and labor of love. I remember starting in real estate years ago in Charleston, and at that time, they were doing normal engineering in property developments across the Lowcountry. They gave all of that up to make a difference and, in turn, have been equally inspirational in the way that they have created a platform by which others can serve their fellow man and their god above through work with Water Mission.

They held a multitude of perspectives, and I am sure if we looked for disagreement we could have found it...but the conversation around ideas was fantastic. I was so struck by what was occurring that I asked what was going on, and one of the locals yelled out, “You never burn bridges on an island that doesn't have any!” Wise words to contemplate.  Incidentally under the category of community, one of the things I learned today was during Hurricane Matthew, James and Brad - the owners of Lucy Bell’s - said that they weren’t particularly good with a chainsaw, but they knew how to cook.

The world ain't what it seems, is it, Gunnie?”  “No, sir.”  “You keep that in mind. The moment you think you got it figured, you’re wrong.”  For those of you who are not fans of the movie “Shooter,” the words above come with the interplay between the movie’s main character, Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), and a rural gunsmith from Tennessee, Mr. Rate.   In fact, Mr. Rate goes on to say, “they also said that artificial sweeteners were safe, WMDs were in Iraq, and Anna Nicole married for love.” And the simple point of all of this is that often times, things aren’t quite what they seem.   Such was the case with H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Act...commonly known as the “minibus appropriation.” It included four of the twelve spending bills that Congress passes each year to fund government. This bill includes a grand total of $789.6 billion in 2018  spending...$658.6 to the military, $88.8 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs and for military construction projects, $37.6 for energy and water-related projects, $3.58 billion for the legislative branch, and finally, $1.6 billion for wall construction along our southern border with Mexico.  I support additional funding for defense, which has been hard pressed by the sequester. I support funding for a wall. In this case, the bill spent $1.6 billion for an additional 70 miles of wall construction. We have roughy 700 miles fenced and about 1300 miles without a border wall or fencing, and I am curious on why it’s now running over $20 million dollars a mile. It seems we could do something that stretches this money further than 70 miles in a 1,300 mile opening, but to the larger point, I support action here. There were a number of other things I supported in the bill - whether tied to national action or federal activity in Charleston or Beaufort, but I believe we have to do those things in the light of sustainable spending.   We aren't there this year. In fact, it seems that few in Washington are paying much attention to the debt, deficits, or the theme of federal spending.  So, my no vote was not about the particulars of these appropriation bills, they were probably as good as they were going to get in this year…the problem is the foundation on which they are constructed, and that is clearly unsustainable spending.  In the real world, we adjust our business and family budgets regularly. And in doing so, we may increase one category while we decrease another. Isn’t that the whole idea of a budget? We set priorities and, accordingly, have to adjust things around them. We never simply ask why we don’t just include more on all of the above.   Fundamentally, this is what this year’s appropriations process is built around.   Let me give you a few specifics….  One, the budget this year proposes to increase spending by about $70 billion. This would be paid for by suggested cuts to mandatory spending of $200 billion. The problem is these mandatory spendings may or may not come at any point in the next ten years. No Congress can obligate another Congress. They’re new every two years. To suggest that we can dictate policy five Congresses from now is inventive…but hardly financially prudent. It’s for this reason that the Congressional Budget Office presumes that this year’s deficit would increase by $65 billion.   If you care about this sort of thing and its implications for our way of life and those we love, how do you sign off on the spending that is based on that budget projection?   Two, a gaming of the budget caps is already under way. What’s proposed in the House budget is to dramatically increase military spending. What you can certainly expect on the Senate side is that the same will be done on the rest of domestic discretionary. This works out well for everyone but the taxpayer, wherein this case 1+1 will equal two more dollars of spending for each of us, as we make our way through this year’s spending cycle.   Three, what I’ve outlined above is the optimistic case. It presumes that the numbers that have been laid out in the budget are realistic. They are not. I strongly believe that the House budget’s economic growth projections are optimistic, just as the Trump budget projections have already been proven to be by the Congressional Budget Office. The long and the short of this means that if the gross numbers aren’t reached, we are looking at somewhere around another trillion dollars in debt and deficit that will be added to our respective tabs.   Two last points to be watchful of, as we go through spending this year.   One, slush funds. In this bill, it takes $28.6 billion of defense spending and puts it into something called the National Defense Restoration Fund. This is essentially a bank account that the Secretary of Defense can tap to pay for virtually any project related to modernizing or restoring any element of our Armed Forces at any time, so long as Congress is alerted 15 days in advance. This is a problem because only Congress has the constitutional authority to appropriate funds. Congress is to debate the different priorities and then fund the ones they believe to be most meritorious. While I have the utmost respect for General Mattis, I don’t believe that Congress should give up its power of the purse over the $28.6 billion allocated to this fund.  The other is open-ended commitments.   A prime example of this would be the current Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) contained in this bill. It doesn’t exist. Congress is still operating on a 2001 authorization of force, and doing it this way means that Congress has essentially given a blank check for operations and their costs in the Middle East. This approach is good neither from a constitutional nor a taxpayer standpoint.","status",NA,NA,29,20,3,1,1,2,0,1

This Act was a package of four smaller spending bills to fund the Defense Department, Energy Department, Veterans Affairs Department, military construction projects, and the Legislative Branch.   Let me give you a few details on what I viewed as some of the more important amendments.  Several targeted the Congressional Budget Office, either in terms of reducing its funding, functionality, or both. Two of those amendments received votes. The first, offered by Rep. Scott Perry, would have cut funding for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in half. The second, offered by Rep. Morgan Griffith, would have eliminated the CBO’s Budget Analysis Division, which produces projections of federal spending and cost estimates for legislative policy proposals.   I voted against both of these amendments for a number of reasons but by no means does that indicate I am satisfied with the work CBO has been producing. Often times in life it's better to fix something and improve it than it is to completely discard it. Such is the case with the Congressional Budget Office. I don't like many of their forecasts, but the idea of going to an average of private forecasts would be even more disastrous. In that scenario, Republicans would pick the forecast that suited their purposes while the Democrats did the same. I think our debt and spending problems are too big to let the party that controls the House or Senate drive economic forecast...economic forecasts should be based on an economic forecast, not politics.    Neither amendment passed.      An amendment offered by Rep. Brendan Boyle may end up being pretty important healthwise for people living around some of our military bases back home. The amendment would increase environmental restoration funding for both the Navy and the Air Force to remove perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) that has made its way into drinking water near a number of military installations across the nation, including in the Lowcountry. Elevated levels of these harmful chemicals have now been found at over 600 sites in current and former military installations around the United States. As recently as 2016, 26 sites in South Carolina were being investigated for this contamination, including six at Joint Base Charleston Air Base, three at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, and three at Marine Corps Recruiting Depot Parris Island. Perfluorinated compounds were included in firefighting foam used by the military at fire training sites for decades beginning in the 1970s. All of us have responsibility to clean up our own messes...this goes from making the bed, to perfluorinated compounds. I therefore voted for the amendment, which passed, 256 to 169.  Rep. Jerry Nadler once again brought his amendment forward on indefinite detention at Guantanamo Bay, and I voted for the amendment, as I have the last four times it was offered. It failed 172 to 252. To restate my position, I join with the people here at home, and the rest of the South Carolina delegation, in being opposed to detainees from Guantanamo being brought to the Navy Brig in North Charleston. But, I do see several problems with not addressing the issue of indefinite detention.   Our Founding Fathers were emphatic in their opposition to the possibility to holding someone indefinitely without resolution. They purposefully injected rights to a speedy trial and habeas corpus into our Constitution...and these principles apply even to prisoners held on US-controlled soil. If one believes that the Constitution is to reign supreme in our system of government, we have to adhere to it, even when it’s hard. I understand that terrorism is a new war without the traditional boundaries of nation states, but a new threat does not require we abandon existing institutions.   We have dealt before on the issue of enemy combatants and what to do with them. In the wake of World War II, we held a host of military tribunals that brought justice. There were not the same levels of protections that were offered American citizens, but based on this lower threshold of required evidence, we convicted many who had attempted to bring harm to our nations and the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who were working to defend our country. When a verdict was rendered, we either set people free or took them out back and shot them. There was finality and certainty to the process. Holding someone for 30, 40, or 50 years erodes this notion of bringing people to justice. It also does not enhance our security because we originally held some detainees because we believed we could gather information that would be useful to our forces. After they’ve been detained for twenty years, they’re so far removed from the battlefield that they have nothing in the way of intelligence to further offer. Finally, staying with the status quo costs us a lot, when a single bullet can be much less expensive.  Let me explore this thought...as of January 2017, there are 41 prisoners still being held there at a total annual cost of about $450 million. That comes out to approximately $11 million per detainee per year. Compare that to housing a prisoner at the federal super maximum security prison in Colorado, where it costs about $60,000 per year...or in other words about 183 times less. I am not saying Colorado is the answer, just that we should be open to alternatives, given its remote location and the fact that there has never been an escape from a supermax detention facility. I most favor military trial - and the remedy I believe would come with it.  An amendment offered by Rep. Steve King would have prohibited any funds appropriated in this bill from being used to enforce Davis-Bacon wage requirements. The Davis-Bacon Act, now 86 years old, authorizes the payment of a “prevailing wage” for workers on federal construction projects. The original intent was to protect local workers from large national contractors that could offer lower bids for federal projects by bringing in lower-priced workers.   However, Davis-Bacon predates the establishment of federal minimum wage laws, other labor protection laws, and a whole host of government regulations concerning fair bidding for contracts. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that Davis-Bacon will actually drive up labor costs for federal construction projects to the tune of $15.7 billion over the next 10 years. Congress owes it to the American people to ensure that their tax dollars are being spent as effectively and efficiently and it’s for this reason I voted in favor of the amendment, which failed, 178 to 249.","status",NA,NA,40,42,5,0,0,0,1,0

The two attacks, called WannaCry and Petya, took only hours to infect hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries. Hospitals, banks, transportation networks, public utilities, and government systems were shut down, and terabytes of sensitive data were stolen or lost completely.  These attacks were indicative of a new norm, in which geopolitical conflicts will be hashed out in cyberspace instead of on the battlefield. That’s author Alexander Klimberg’s message in his new book, The Darkening Web, which was recently reviewed in the Wall Street Journal.  The very nature of the hacking tools that were stolen from the NSA speaks to the contradictory nature of America’s cyber policy. Called “zero-day exploits,” these tools are based on flaws buried deep in the code of operating systems and major pieces of software that even their developers don’t know about. Once it finds these vulnerabilities, instead of informing developers so they can mend the holes in their code, the NSA tends to store them away in secrecy, so it can use them later on. The only risk in doing this, of course, is the possibility that someone might break in and steal them, which is exactly what happened at the NSA this past April.  In his book, Klimberg discusses the events that led up to these recent attacks in the wider context of cyber warfare history. He also explores some policy changes the United States could make to better prepare itself for this new norm of cyber warfare.

This resolution would allow Virginia, Maryland, and DC to establish a tri-state Washington Metrorail Safety Commission. Under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress has the authority to permit states and the District of Columbia to enter into interstate compacts. But what Congress doesn’t have the authority to do is authorize compacts that would allow states to conduct warrantless searches of private property. One section of the agreement did just that, and accordingly, I was one of five Republicans to vote no.   The section in question would have authorized the Metrorail Safety Commission to enter upon any property that is adjacent to the metrorail system for investigations, repairs, and more. This would include any privately-owned lands and premises that happen to be next to the railway. The only restriction on this authority would be that the CEO of the metro transit authority must first give “reasonable notice.” The Founding Fathers didn’t protect us under the Fourth Amendment with a “reasonable notice” standard...they said that absent an ongoing emergency or crime, there needs to be a warrant issued by a judge in order to intrude on folks’ private property.  The DC metro system is in dire need of improvements, particularly those related to rider safety. In fact, in the last three years alone, there have been three total train derailments. But while it seems reasonable that Congress should work to address these issues as soon as possible, we should be wary of any bill that rolls over private property rights in exchange for a remedy.","status",NA,NA,53,23,10,2,0,0,3,2

It’s always been about the larger notion of sustaining a fifty-year tradition in our country, wherein candidates of both parties release their returns at the presidential level. Consequently, people at the state level running for offices like governor did as well.   I released my tax returns when I ran for governor because that was the tradition, and it’s my firm belief that once you break it at the presidential level, there will no longer be a reason for people to do so at the state level. These tax returns serve as one more data point for a voter in determining the candidate of their choice, and more information - rather than less - has never been a bad thing in an open political system.   As a conservative, it’s quite natural to have a suspicion of governmental power or those who hold its reins. And it’s for this reason that I just cosponsored another Republican’s bill on the tax return issue.  The bill is H.R. 1938, the President-Elect Release of Tax Return Act, introduced by Congressman Tom Garrett, and it’s a different way of skinning the cat.   Rather than requiring all major candidates to disclose their returns, which would be my preference, it requires simply an offshoot of that tradition and requires only the President-elect to release personal tax returns.   Again, it’s not as big of bite of the apple as I have called for, and what I’ve signed on to in cosponsoring other bills… but as the old saying goes, “if you don’t first succeed, then try again.”","status",NA,NA,612,876,49,67,15,12,10,134

The Founding Fathers were so deliberate about this. They knew that war’s costs were borne by the taxpayer...and that the ultimate costs were borne by slain soldiers whose bodies were returned not to Washington but to congressional districts across this country.  Once you start deviating from this, there are all sorts of offshoots for both soldiers…and taxpayers.   The most recent wrinkle in this comes in the Ukraine. The idea of the United States and Russia supplying weapons to opposing sides in various conflicts is not something new. It happened in Afghanistan in the 1980s, the Balkans in the 1990s, and now in Syria. Each serve as a grim reminder that these proxy wars can often devolve into costly, violent, and at times lengthy conflicts.   I raise this point because earlier this month, the Departments of State and Defense sent a proposal to the White House that would send weapons to Ukraine’s military in order to assist in its fight against Russian-backed separatists...one step closer to another proxy war with Russia.   In this conflict, I stand on the side of the Ukraine. But wherever you might stand, it should not be a unilateral decision made by any president. It should be decided by the Congress. I think that given the broad consequences that flow from prolonged proxy engagements, arming the Ukraine military should be a decision made after debate in Congress.  Proxy wars can involve the use of millions (if not billions) of US taxpayer dollars, affect our nation’s overall military strategy, and are just one step shy of outright US warfighting. Founding Fathers like Madison decried the biases that were built into executive and immediate action on war and believed they should be tempered by a Congress that directly bore its human and financial costs.

In several ways, our economy currently looks a lot like an economy on the brink of another major recession. We have a labor market at full strength, stock prices that are relatively high, and a central bank that is tightening monetary policy by raising interest rates despite weaker-than-anticipated growth in inflation. In other words, a number of key indicators are coming together in a sort of economic perfect storm.   Yet, despite clouds brewing on the horizon, markets seem more-or-less unphased. This lack of worry can be seen by looking at “implied volatility”, which refers to the cost of hedging against major market downturns using options. Think of this as the cost of insuring against a potential recession. Right now, implied volatility is near its lowest point in a decade. That’s because our current period of uninterrupted economic expansion has gone on for eight years now. When conditions are good, investors and businesses tend to behave as if those good conditions will last forever, which they never do. In our nation’s history, only two periods of economic expansion have lasted longer than the current one. Given the storm clouds on the horizon, assuming that these fair conditions will go on forever is not realistic.   It’s important to note that the United States was in a much better position to ride out a big economic storm ten years ago than it is today. Prior to the last recession, America’s debt-to-GDP ratio was 35%, less than half of what it is today. That meant the federal government had enough “fiscal space” to boost the economy through stimulus spending without pushing our debt level into uncharted territory. Furthermore, prior to the last recession, the Federal Reserve’s target interest rate was near 5%. Again, this meant the Fed had enough room to lower interest rates and stimulate the economy, which it did by dropping the target interest rate to near-zero and holding it there for more than six years. That rate began to climb back upwards last year, and now hovers between 1% and 1.25%. However, unless that rate is much higher when the next recession comes, the Federal Reserve’s ability to intervene will be much more limited than in the past.  In short, unless the federal government prepares by normalizing monetary policy and reducing its debt level, it will have limited ability to shelter our economy from the next big storm. I encourage you to read the article, which explores the concept of implied volatility in greater detail and contemplates the potential negative ramifications of failing to prepare….","link","https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-soaring-assets-and-low-unemployment-mean-its-time-to-start-worrying-1499247003","wsj.com",84,54,45,0,4,14,4,1

What’s important to remember, though, is that they are simply financial ingredients key to the long run viability and sustainability of our republic.   In this regard and on the theme of the sustainability of our republic, I thought that the book “Destined for War” remarkably thoughtful for its insights.  It’s no secret that a tension exists between the United States and China. We are the top two economies in the world, and we have very different political operating systems. As China has grown, it has increasingly tested our primacy. We can see that right now in the South China Sea and their claims to territory that is clearly in international waters. What is largely unique about the present situation is that China’s rise is largely one of economics. In 1980 America’s share of the global economic market was 22%, while China’s was 2%.  Now America’s share is 16%, and China’s is 18%.  I mention this because the book touches on these exact points and dives into similar historic examples that almost all seem to point toward the same conclusion...war. The book calls this inevitability “Thucydides’s trap.”  The author finds that in 16 cases in which the “Thucydides’s trap” has occurred over the past 500 years, 12 of them ended violently.  From Germany’s rise in the early 20th century, which disrupted Britain’s dominant industrial complex, to the Japanese takeover of the Pacific in the 1930s and 1940s, we should learn from the past and be careful not to repeat the same mistakes.  The book however does not seem to be all doom and gloom. It also explains how Britain was able to avoid a potential conflict...but it may not be one that many US citizens find palatable. Britain gave way to the economic rise of the United States in the Great Rapprochement at the turn of the last century, which led to great prosperity for both countries. Fortunately for Britain, the United States shared much of the same value and political system. Unfortunately for the United States today, China shares little in these respects with our country.

I was one of seven Republicans to vote no, but the bill passed 230 to 190. On its face, this bill seemed like a straightforward attempt to solve years of drought and groundwater depletion in the western United States. But in fact, the bill is far more complex than it first appears, and consequently, I had two major reservations worth noting below.   One was tied to the notion of federalism. If you really believe that the government most local generally governs best, then locals should indeed have some degree of authority in determining what happens in their backyard. The second involved the establishment of a “pay to play” permitting system for water management projects that would unfairly benefit communities with the most resources.  First, the bill overrides the State of California’s environmental regulations as they apply to the federal government’s Central Valley Project (CVP) and the state government’s State Water Project (SWP). What this means in simpler terms is that the federal government would be able to ignore a wide range of environmental laws in California that were passed to protect and manage the state’s own water and wildlife resources. I suspect you and I may disagree with many of the environmental laws passed in California, but if one really believes in the idea of local control, we would recognize it is not up to us in South Carolina to dictate California state law.   The Tenth Amendment to the Constitution declares that any powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution are reserved to the states or to the people. While I’m sympathetic to the bill’s attempts to help the state and federal governments better prevent future droughts, we should ultimately be leery of any bill that tries to replace local authority with more federal control.  Second, the bill sets up a “pay to play” permitting system for expediting the approval of dam construction in California. Local communities would be allowed under this bill to pay a fee to the Bureau of Reclamation in order to expedite the decision process on their dam permitting applications.  The bottom line here is that wealthier communities that can afford to pay the expediting fee will be approved far more quickly than communities that might be struggling to pay for other services. The law represents the promise of equality under the law, and accordingly, I am uncertain how one can treat two municipalities differently in this instance.","status",NA,NA,57,33,10,0,0,3,2,1

My amendment directs the FAA to examine our current policy towards supersonic aircraft and build a timeline to allow for the flight of supersonic aircraft over the continental United States...which is currently illegal.    This has been the law of the land since 1973 because the supersonic planes of the age created a loud boom when they broke the sound barrier.

Let me say again, one person’s guilt in a horrific shooting does not mean that the rest of us are guilty of horrendous actions and the consequences that come with them, but I really do believe we are at an inflection point.  It’s one that I believe suggests that we should all take a little bit deeper look on how we see others and react to others. At least in the political world, it seems to me that people are reacting faster and faster. In some cases they rush to judgment without looking at the underlying facts. My friend Cubby Culbertson in Columbia used to always say when emotion is high, discernment is low. And what I have seen over the last month in my comings and goings in the district is a level of frustration and tension that in some cases is palpable. What we do next in diffusing this will rest on the actions and deliberations of all of us.   None of this directly ties to the tragedy that occurred on King Street, and I’m still not articulating the thought that is running through my mind that well, but to see my attempt at doing so, please take a look at the video below…","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/videos/702454296631021/",NA,75,27,11,0,0,0,2,2

From them, let me leave you with a few thoughts:   One, following up on what I wrote yesterday in the wake of the tragedy on King Street and my observations in the WCIV | ABC News 4 interview last night, there really is a level of intensity and energy out there that I’ve never before seen in politics. Some of it’s good because it’s reflective of the way in which people care about our country and its institutions. Some of it’s not so good, as some groups in some settings are very quick to react or condemn without much in the way of analysis for coming to their very quick conclusion.   What I talked about in yesterday’s post is the need for all of us to take a little bit of a breath in reacting to people that we disagree with. One of the tragic consequences it seems to me of social media is that a lot of people will react very quickly and say things that they probably wouldn’t say if they were looking at you in your place of business or in public venues. There’s a level of restraint that comes in human interaction that doesn’t seem to come with social media interaction.   In this regard, I want to thank the different folks that have come out over the month of August to both agree and to disagree with different stands that I’ve taken. At times, the engagement has been energetic, but with every group that I’ve visited, it’s been respectful - and I’m appreciative of that. On this front, let me single out the group Indivisible. We come from very different starting points in what we believe, but I recognize though we may differ in our political views, that we both love our country and are looking for ways to make it better.   It takes a lot of political energy to consistently turn people out for events that can be quite warm in the August sun, but there’s been a steady stream of folks from their organization that show up at different public events I’ve held. I’ve been impressed with this level of political engagement. It says people care and that they are energized… and regardless of one’s political affiliation, that’s something that we need more of. We all need to look for ways in engaging in the world of politics, so we may indeed bring about change that can better people’s lives.   In the same vein, what I have also noticed as the month has worn on is that there has been something of a spontaneous counterreaction in the groups that assembled. The largest percentage of crowd participation by far would go to folks tied to Indivisible, but here toward the end of the month, by ones and twos I’ve seen people begin to filter into my public meetings with different and often more conservative viewpoints.   What’s all this mean?   That the debate continues. The grand experiment that is America was predicated on reason, deliberation, and the free exchange of ideas. Over the last month, I’ve seen much of that over my different meetings, and I again want to thank each one of the folks who came out and made their voice heard. The debate before us is enjoined by folks of all walks of life, and I look forward to the discussions to come over the month ahead, as September will be an incredibly busy time in Washington.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/photos/a.124615434414913.1073741828.118387985037658/702764303266687/?type=3",NA,75,24,6,4,0,1,0,0

Can we just admit that this is crazy?  Our federal government is $20 trillion in debt, and now we’re going to begin a giveaway program from the federal government to local and state law enforcement agencies. This program has been heavily abused because we oftentimes discount the things we get for free and value the things that we pay for.   Let me give you one example.   Back when I was governor, I walk into a small county sheriff’s office, and they tell me that the sheriff isn’t available - he’s out taking helicopter lessons. Mind you, this is a very small county; yet his office had received seven jet-powered helicopters because helicopters were the sheriff’s thing. The lessons he was taking weren’t for free, the jet-fuel he was burning wasn’t for free… and in fact, the helicopters that came from the federal government weren’t really free either.   I could give you a lot of other examples that I saw over my years as governor on this one, but the long and short of it is that, even purely from an accounting standpoint, it’s a mistake. It causes us to overstate the cost of the federal government and to understate the cost of local government. It also leads to a lot of strange choices, as the seven helicopter example shows.   In any case, I think this decision is a step backwards for the taxpayer. Indeed, I introduced a bill last Congress, the Responsible Law Enforcement Acquisition Act of 2016, in an attempt to curtail this program, and I would just ask that you take the time to look under the hood on this issue, given the way in which things your federal taxes have paid for will now be given away for free.  I just put out a press release explaining my reasoning and thought you might like to give it a read.","link","https://sanford.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/sanford-opposes-reinstatement-of-1033-program","sanford.house.gov",591,431,119,16,3,26,6,75

All of them should make our blood boil for the way that they represent attacks on not just our money, but our time. Folks work awfully hard to make a living, and the minimum that they hope from government is that the money they send will be well-spent. We only have so many days here on this Earth, and so this issue of government waste goes to the core of not just spending but indeed the amount of time that we’re forced to work for government  So here’s one for you.  Since 2007, the Pentagon has spent $93 million to buy 1.3 million uniforms for Afghan soldiers. The question of whether or not we should be supplying the Afghan military with something as simple as uniforms is a separate debate. But here’s the catch: $28 million was spent on uniforms with the wrong camouflage pattern - the ‘woodland’ camo pattern provides little disguise in a country that is 98% desert.  Some would argue that it’s not that big a deal. That it’s a rounding error because since 2001, US taxpayers have spent more than $66 billion to train and equip the Afghan military.

I’m certainly guilty of being diverted from the meaning of Labor Day because it marks the beginning of the end of all the summer activities that I love. So, I focus on the activities. The picnics, the beginning of football season, the events around the water…even the foods of summer that, for me, include things like fried okra, corn on the cob, and watermelon. I’m so disappointed with the end of summer that I’ve often skipped the chance to pause and think about the way in which we celebrate the meaning and value, and even self-worth, that comes through labor.   It’s often been said that the things we’re given, we’ll never appreciate the way we will the things we work for. People may not like boot camp at Parris Island, but as they look back on the years that came with their military service, there is incredible pride.   In the same light, our youngest son loved his time playing football in large measure because of the amount of work and effort that he put into it.  And so today we celebrate this notion of labor - of exerting ourselves on a sustained basis toward a given goal. People are doing that today at the assembly line at Boeing. They’re doing it on the docks at the Port. They’re doing it today in fixing a meal or making a bed in the hospitality industry throughout this district. They’re doing it today with a logging crew cutting timber somewhere in the woods and waters of the Lowcountry.   It’s part of what’s made this country great. Putting one’s head down and forging ahead is the hallmark of labor and small business growth in this country. It’s how the West was won. It’s what brought rail to California, built the skyscrapers of New York, and even built the church spires that mark downtown Charleston.   My hope for you is that you’re working on something you care about. If not, my prayer would be that something soon materializes that better takes advantage of your God-given talents. In whatever we do, I would do it with zeal. It was Martin Luther King, Jr. who once observed, “If a man is called to be a streetsweeper, he should sweep streets even as Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, here lived a great streetsweeper who did his job well.”   So indeed, happy Labor Day…may your labors go well.","status",NA,NA,86,40,4,14,0,0,1,0

The article’s title was “Sanford prepares new rounds of challenges to Trump’s policies.”    If I was actually taking the time to prepare amendments simply to be adversarial to our president, I’d be calling in this morning as well to ask: what’s the deal?   Fortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. Each one of the items listed had nothing to do with our president, but rather everything to do with things I have worked on for years. In fact, the saying is if it bleeds, it leads with the media. I don’t like that, and I wish it weren’t so. But newspapers, TV stations, and the media generally too often look for controversy - even when none exists - as a way to get people to give them viewership. Such is indeed the case here, and accordingly, let me peel back each of the layers of the onion they created in their story.   One, I have amendments that would hamper the administration’s decision to open up the possibility of offshore drilling off the coast of South Carolina. This has absolutely nothing to do with the current administration, given that I made a stand against offshore drilling during the Obama administration. I have been constant in my opposition, based on the consistent voice I’ve gotten from so many up and down the coast of South Carolina who believe it would be a mistake to risk environmental damage, tourism, or even contend with the onshore development that must take place to support offshore operations. The point in all this is that it’s an idea that I believe the majority of folks along the coast of South Carolina believe in. Accordingly, as their Representative, I’ve tried to consistently advocate for that viewpoint. One can be for or against this, but the larger takeaway is that it’s something that I’ve long worked on - and something that has nothing to do with the present administration, given the way I’ve worked on it through different administrations.    The same holds true with regard to the issue of Cuba. My interest here has not been developed over the last few months of Trump presidency…but rather over a long number of years. When I was last in Congress, I actually voted for the Helms-Burton Act. It attempted to further sanction and boycott Cuba as a way to bring about change. This was in the mid-1990s. Over the years, I saw the ways in which this was not bringing about the change that we would all like to see in Cuba. So, given the way in which trying the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result really is the definition of insanity - I came to believe a different approach might work better. Accordingly, near twenty years ago, I introduced a bill that would allow Americans to travel to Cuba, believing that engagement could bring about changes that sanctions did not. This is the very approach that Ronald Reagan used to bring down the wall in Eastern Europe. It was consistent with what our country has done in places like Vietnam and a whole host of regimes that we don’t approve of.   More than anything, I saw this as an issue of American liberty. Our Founding Fathers promised us liberty and the ability to come and go as you see fit, rather than as government dictates. Unlike the former Soviet Union where you had to get travel papers to go from one providence to another, that’s never been the American way. In fact, you and I as Americans are currently free to travel to any country on the globe, save for one. And that’s Cuba. Literally, you and I could travel to Iran, Syria, North Korea, or Iraq without the federal government’s prohibition. I saw our Cuba policy as an outlier and consequently worked to change it.    The point in all this is that you can agree or disagree on what I’ve tried to do on this front for a long number of years, but it is hardly action that is built around preparing a round of challenges to the Trump presidency. It’s simply an idea that I’ve believed in for more than twenty years. And that’s my larger point. Doesn’t it gall all of us when things are packaged in such a way by the media that creates conflict that doesn’t exist?    This brings me to the last point of the article, which is an amendment I intend to offer on Secret Service protection. The way the law works now on this front is that a president is afforded full-time protection at the White House, the weekend retreat that is made available for presidents in the form of Camp David, and full-time protection for the president and his family, regardless of their different travels. The president can spend weekends with friends in Maine one weekend, California the next, and Florida the following, and the Secret Service will be there in full-force. Additionally, the president is given full-time protection of what was their permanent home. So, if you were president from Cincinnati, your home in Cincinnati would be given full-time protection. If, however, you had a second home outside Cincinnati, there’s currently a cap of Secret Service spending at $200,000.   This brings us to the new territory that we travel with President Trump. He has an array of different homes and membership communities, and so what worked quite well for past presidents isn’t working so well for this one. As a consequence, the Secret Service has spent more than $60 million this year in additional protection, and they have now come back asking for an automatic overage on additional protection beyond the $200,000 limit on second, third, fourth, fifth, and more homes. I have an amendment that simply says that the Secret Service shouldn’t be given an automatic overage. I believe they need to come back to Congress to ask for overage funds. It doesn’t mean they can’t get the money. It simply means they need to ask for it...that they are not given a blank check.   Watching out for the taxpayer is not a new issue for me. It’s what I’ve always worked on in public policy.    Our Founding Fathers were incredibly deliberate about insisting that only Congress held the purse strings. That only Congress could authorize spending on behalf of me and you as taxpayers. They did it because they believed there was a level of accountability that comes with people who are elected every few years - that is different from the many bureaucracies that make up the federal government. It doesn’t mean that the Secret Service or the FAA or the IRS or the Maritime Commission or the Air Force aren’t working hard to do their job – it just means that in doing their job, at times they focus on that exclusively without worrying about the cost. Someone has to watch out for the bottom line – especially when you’re $20 trillion in the hole. So, on this amendment, once again, I would have offered the same amendment had this problem risen during the Obama administration, the Bush administration, the Clinton administration, or the Bush administration before that. It has nothing to do with the occupant of the White House, but everything to do with the simple belief that somebody needs to be asking the question of what do we do about this spending? If we do not stop and ask about putting this spending on automatic pilot, we will have spent over $100 million in Secret Service protection without anyone asking the question of how might we do this just a little bit differently?   I don't know how I can stay true to the promises I made in trying to watch out for the taxpayer, if I in fact don't ask the question. Again, my amendment wouldn't stop us spending on this Secret Service protection...it would just ask that we not put it on automatic pilot.  What I also found a bit misleading about this article is that some would read it as my priorities for the year. These are but three of many amendments that I will offer over the course of this year. I have chances to do so at the subcommittee level, the full committee level, and even the House floor. Those amendments represent chances to make bills just a little bit better in looking out for the taxpayer - or looking out for American liberty. The big things I continue to work on are the big things we’re all talking about in terms of what comes next on tax reform, healthcare reform, and the budget. On tax reform alone, I was able to join with others in stopping a border adjustment tax that would have taken a trillion dollars from your and my pockets over the years ahead had it been enacted.    So the bottom line is that the media will do what the media has to do…but I thought I owed many of you just a little bit of an explanation on this Friday afternoon, given the degree of which these three amendments had a much greater context. I do think that context is the key to looking at any of the actions I take in trying to represent you. I have a Democrat who is now running against me who says that I’m way too supportive of Trump and vote with him more than 90% of the time. I have others who say that to offer an amendment which questions any form of spending is to question the president. In that vein, you just can’t win, and the conclusion I have come to is that I owe it to each of you to stay true to what I’ve always tried to do, and that's to protect your wallet or pocketbook from the endless assault that comes its way from Washington.","status",NA,NA,175,116,23,13,0,3,4,2

Under the category of counting our blessings, I want to turn the attention of today’s post to Hurricane Harvey. We’ve all seen coverage and images of the devastation… but you know the hardest part of any natural disaster?  It’s what comes next.  It’s the clean-up. It's in trying to put life back together again.  I’ll never forget in the wake of flooding in Conway, SC joining a Baptist relief team in mucking out houses after the floodwaters went down. It was heart wrenching. The family photo albums, the family Bible, the mementos that mark a lifetime – all were forever lost, as we carted things out and threw them into the dumpster outside the house.  As water levels go down in Texas, that’ll be the next stage, and there’ll be a lot of pain and I suspect more than a few tears that go with it.  So I’d simply ask that you join me in sending up a prayer for the families whose lives have been impacted in the Lone Star State and in Louisiana - and in remembering how fortunate we are to have not seen a major hurricane come our way in some time. I’ll continue to knock on wood and say more than just a few prayers that this remains the case, as we go through this hurricane season.  I did have a conversation with Louise Welch who runs the Lowcountry chapter of the South Carolina Red Cross. I’ve known her for years, and she does a first rate job of helping to marshal and organize the more than considerable services of the Red Cross in our region. She brought me up to speed on the different relief teams that have been deployed to Texas and what they were doing in coordinating relief efforts in that part of our country.  As she did so, it struck me how she needs help. One, in keeping our government small enough that there is room for a civil society and a host of non-profits that do what government might otherwise attempt to do. It's something my friends on the left often forget: if government grows to the point of crowding out any other entity's ability to help...the Red Cross and organizations like it are gone. People do volunteer, they do contribute, they do get involved voluntarily. This is in strong contrast to government which compels us to help...even to the point of jail if we don't...and it's what so-called civil society is all about.  I’m always reluctant to point to any one charity, given the number of great charities that are out there providing services so that government doesn’t have to, but given our vulnerability along the coast of SC with storms, and the Red Cross's particular valiant efforts on this front, I did want to write to encourage you to consider giving to our friends and neighbors in Texas and Louisiana. I know that Louise and her team would be appreciative, and I know that when trouble comes next our way, the Red Cross will be there to help us here at home.  In any case, I’ve included their link, and I’ll let you do whatever you think you need to do on that front!  Happy Saturday….","link","http://www.redcross.org/","redcross.org",55,32,5,2,0,4,1,3

This is a frighteningly powerful storm. I’d offer two quick thoughts on the hurricane front.  One, for those of you who have not seen it, I’d recommend the SpaghettiModels website. It offers an array of different predictive models on a hurricane like this and, in that regard, is something of a one-stop-shop in fact-finding. I remember back in the governor days studying the different National Hurricane Center forecast cone charts to death as you try and get some sense of where a storm is or isn’t going...and yet when you get to this stage of being a couple days out, all you can do is send a prayer.  Two, today, the House of Representatives passed a bill that will provide $7.85 billion in additional federal emergency disaster aid for those affected by Hurricane Harvey by a vote of 419 to 3. Specifically, the bill allocates $7.4 billion to the Federal Emergency Management Administration’s Disaster Relief Fund and $450 million to the Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program...and that’s it. There are no other spending provisions for projects that have little to no relation to the immediate destruction at hand.   I voted for it because this really is an emergency, and it simply amounted to refilling the FEMA disaster relief fund. The administration has made it clear that their balances are running low, and for them to continue to be able to provide emergency assistance, they needed cash. This bill will make its way through the Senate and back to the House for the president’s signature before we leave town this week, given the cash crunch that’s taking place within the agency. I am concerned about how this will be done now that there is a suggested deal between the president and Democrats in the Senate in moving this bill forward attached to a short-term increase in the debt ceiling and in three months’ appropriations for government spending. But that’s not the vote we took today, and we will see what comes back to the House.  I think that there are a couple important considerations coming forward, as this inevitably will not be the last bill as it relates to Harvey funding or hurricane funding this year.   One, these bills need to be paid for. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, the Republican Study Committee came up with a list of spending cuts that would pay for Sandy aid. This needs to be done again, and I will work with others on the Republican Study Committee to come up with such a list. If not, each crisis becomes yet another excuse to grow government expenditures.  Two, Congress needs to do a much better job of monitoring emergency spending. Bills providing emergency funding in the wake of major storms or natural disasters can sometimes become magnets for all kinds of unrelated spending. When the $50.5 billion Hurricane Sandy relief bill passed through Congress a couple of years ago, unfortunately that is what happened, and that is why 216 members of Congress voted against that bill. It gave tens of billions of dollars in unrelated spending to items that include fishery management in American Samoa, global warming initiatives, Amtrak mass transit funding, and money for federal building repair in Washington.  One of the reasons this happens is that we give agencies something of a blank check in up-front money. When the president was in the real estate business, I’m quite sure that he never pre-released cash to any contractor for a building not yet built. That’s not the way it gets done. Instead, there are drawdowns on cash, as the building passes different thresholds toward construction. This should be the case as well with emergency funding. It keeps the amounts smaller so that Congress can better examine the way in which the money is spent. And it more narrowly aligns spending with requests. There are no blank checks in this process, and I will work with other members on a reform bill with this kind of drawdown approach.   Finally, in this vein, FEMA itself needs greater oversight from Congress. Hurricane Matthew last year caused considerable damage to places like Edisto Beach and Hilton Head or Daufuskie in Beaufort County. That storm was a year ago, and yet in large measure, we’re still getting or waiting for payments from FEMA...and I think that that funding gap should be considerably closed. I’ll be working on reform here as well.  One last thought to reiterate: though I voted for this replenishment today, let me emphasize the degree to which I’m worried about what it may be attached to in coming back from the Senate. I believe that bills that are tied to three or four different subject matters are bills that offer no accountability to the taxpayer because they give a reason for every policymaker to have voted for or against the bill. They allow a policymaker to say to the taxpayer that “I was for you, but had to vote against the bill because of this other extraneous provision.”","status",NA,NA,105,44,8,7,0,0,2,0

I believe it was a real mistake and a loss for the taxpayer and even those of us who live along the coast who might one day be in need of further federal assistance. The measure however passed by a vote of 316 to 90.   Let me be clear that I have no problem working on bipartisan ideas. Neither Republicans nor Democrats hold the corner on truth, and as a consequence, whether on offshore drilling, things like the president’s tax returns, and more, I have been willing to reach across the aisle in search of solutions.  But I don’t believe that the deal the president negotiated with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi was in the interest of taxpayers in the First District. I say this at several levels:  One, you can never fix a problem that you don’t deal with. This is in fact the story of federal spending and the national debt these days. What conservatives have insisted on for years has been some breaking measure in slowing up the growth of debt in exchange for their vote to increase the debt. It’s a blunt tool. It’s an awkward tool. But it is one of the few leverage points that conservatives have in trying to say that we have to do something to slow up this juggernaut of federal spending. What this proposal did was to deny conservatives what they had asked for, which was the inclusion of some sort of spending reduction measure in exchange for their vote to increase the debt ceiling. This was imminently reasonable. The entire House leadership had heard from its membership, and it was willing to proceed on that basis. Our Founding Fathers were deliberate in setting up a bicameral, legislative body. This would allow the House to signal its will while the Senate might signal a different will, and the differences would be resolved in conference. If things had been allowed to play out, this is what would have happened in this instance. There would have been a more conservative statement of opinion from the House, and perhaps a less conservative one from the Senate...and then we would have ironed out our differences. Instead, the rug was jerked from underneath House and Senate Republican leadership, as the president went around them and instead negotiated with Democratic leadership to move this measure forward. There was much conversation on this very point in the Republican conference this morning, and it has real implications on the trust equation in negotiating other legislation going forward.  Not only did the spending issue not get dealt with, but it got pushed to December - the month that most favors more in the way of spending. I say this because all institutions are human, and in the case of Congress, Members want to go home to be with their families at Christmas. When Congress finds itself negotiating on something around Christmas Eve, you can be sure that there will be a lot of efforts “to get something done” so that Members can go home. It’s for this reason that it wasn’t an accident that Chuck Schumer chose the three-month time period.  Two, hurricane relief should not be held hostage to the debt debate or any other debate. If an emergency is an emergency...then it’s an emergency. It should be treated as such. People’s lives and possessions hang in the balance. Do we really want to get into the business of tying hurricane relief going forward to must-pass legislation? This has not been done in the past and sets a horrible precedent going forward for any of us who live along the coast.  Three, there is no accountability in a Christmas tree. What I mean by that is that when you have a string of 5 or 6 different items that make up a bill, you give every legislator an excuse. You give them a reason to have voted for it or against it. You enable them to say to their constituents “I was for you but had to vote against it because of this other issue.” This is something I fought hard as Governor of South Carolina and have tried to fight equally as hard in Congress for the lack of accountability that comes with these kinds of votes. This is especially the case on big issues like the debt ceiling and emergency aid.   Finally, it was Rahm Emanuel who once observed that “a crisis is a terrible thing to waste.” While the legislative load that was before us for the month of September could hardly be counted as a crisis, it certainly could be counted on as difficult. That pressure of difficulty or crisis is a precondition oftentimes of change in the political system. By letting all the air out of the steaming pot, creative approaches to funding emergencies like hurricanes, the debt limit, and a host of other issues was short-circuited. In fact, I think that what the president did in this instance may make tax reform tougher, given the way in which these different reauthorizations and even the debt ceiling itself will hang over Congress through the fall rather than having dealt with and cleared so that we could exclusively focus on tax reform going forward.","status",NA,NA,175,273,28,11,1,8,9,82

It's certainly never over until it's over in the world of hurricanes, and it looks like we will certainly have near fifty mile an hour winds come Monday...and some level of storm surge and the flooding that comes with it. But compared to what might have come , it looks like we are blessed. The trend line on the National Hurricane Center forecasts is that the storm continues to move west.  In this light, I've attached the latest update from the Center. The forecast again still shows the possibility of a storm surge on Monday -to be more precise somewhere between 4-6 feet, but it could be so much worse. In preparation for that flooding, our oldest son, Marshall, and I went down to the farm this morning, and we moved tractors and other equipment to high ground.   The bottomline is that, on a day like today, there's not much that any of us can do beyond finishing preparations. We can also give thanks for our comparative good fortune. But the obvious here is that our good fortune may in this instance mean misfortune for Florida and Georgia. Accordingly, we should all send a few for folks that direction.  We in fact can do more than that...the Red Cross will be doing remarkable work, and accordingly, I include their link here: http://www.redcross.org/.

We wound up with winds that gusted over 50 miles per hour, but the big issue was the flooding.   The flooding is worse than Matthew. At the farm, we lost the dock, and much of the place was flooded. In talking to friends in Beaufort County, there was a lot of loss due to flooding and high tides as well.  I haven't seen first hand what's happened yet in many of the lower parts of the tri-county area, but I have no doubt that there is a lot of flooding to be dealt with over the days and weeks ahead.

In its wake, several folks have asked about what might come to them in the way of federal disaster assistance. The answer in short form is that we don't know yet.  Here’s how the process works.  In the wake of a storm, damages are assessed at the county level and ultimately forwarded to the state level. There are two forms of assistance: one for public infrastructure and the other for individual assistance. The threshold to trigger Individual Assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is documentation of at least 100 uninsured or underinsured primary residences with extensive damages...meaning the homes are completely destroyed and are uninhabitable. It’s important to note that this triggering mechanism applies only to primary residences - second homes are not counted toward this tally.  Once this total is met, the governor of the state then formally requests the disaster declaration. It’s for this reason that the governors in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Florida made these requests. The president then declared them disaster areas, and individual federal assistance is now available in these states.  At an individual level, FEMA’s assistance program is capped at $33,000 per household, but the average amount received is typically lower. For example, the average payout from Superstorm Sandy in 2012 was about $8,000...and less for Hurricane Katrina in 2005 at about $7,100.  If South Carolina were named a declared disaster area by the president, then in addition to individual assistance, loans are possible as well. They predominantly come in the form of Small Business Administration Disaster loans, which are limited to $200,000 for real estate repair and $40,000 for personal property repair.  But then again, I’m getting ahead of myself. Because as I said earlier, all of this will be determined by whether or not the president declares South Carolina a disaster area, and that will be determined by aggregate damage. In that vein, it’s helpful for residents to self-report any damages they might have suffered to their home or property, which could affect the tally I alluded to earlier.  Should you like to do so, here are the county numbers and links:  Beaufort County: (843) 255-2732 Colleton County: (843) 549-5632 Berkeley County: (843) 719-4800 Charleston County: https://www.crisistrack.com/public/charlestonSC/citizenRequest.html Dorchester County: http://dcscgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/GeoForm/index.html?appid=1b920e4b668b4198bea1a90a535610f6  In the days ahead, we’ll have more information as the overall damages are assessed. But, as I said on Monday, my office is available to help and to answer questions. Feel free to give me a call in Charleston at (843) 352-7572, in Beaufort at (843) 521-2530, and in D.C. at (202) 225-3176...or even my cell at (843) 367-1010.","status",NA,NA,35,23,9,0,0,0,1,0

This is true for its potential to undermine our republic - just as it is in its ability to take from each of us much of what we have worked for over the courses of our lives.  In this light, it was in many ways not surprising that I voted yesterday against H.R. 3354, the omnibus bill. It was  made up of twelve smaller spending bills funding different parts of the federal government. Four of those smaller bills, which authorized $789.6 billion in defense related spending, were already passed by the House at the beginning of August in H.R. 3219. Today’s bill combined those four bills with eight others, which authorize a combined $437 billion in non-defense spending, resulting in an omnibus funding bill authorizing a total of $1.23 trillion in federal spending for 2018. This was $61.3 billion more than in 2017 and $67.5 billion above the current law caps on discretionary spending for 2018.   The bill passed, 211 to 198.  There were several aspects of this bill which I fully support on their own. For example, this bill would prevent enforcement of the Obamacare individual mandate, repeal potentially harmful regulations such as the Waters of the United States rule, enforce pro-life policies like the Conscious Protection Act, and kickstart construction of a wall along our southern border with Mexico. Unfortunately, none of these valuable riders stand much of a chance of making their way through the Senate - and what we will be left with is simply the “more” spending component.  Given that reality, conservative policy riders such as these must be pursued in light of sustainable spending. So, my no vote was in large measure not about the particulars of these appropriation bills - they were arguably as good as they were going to get in this year; it was about the foundation on which they are constructed, and that is clearly unsustainable spending.  Let’s dig a little deeper here.  Under the House Budget Resolution for 2018, the $61.3 billion increase in spending over last year would be paid for by suggested cuts to mandatory spending of $200 billion. The problem is these mandatory spending cuts may or may not come at any point in the next ten years. No Congress can obligate another Congress. They’re new every two years. To suggest that we can dictate policy five Congresses from now is inventive…but hardly financially prudent. It’s for this reason that the Congressional Budget Office presumes that this year’s deficit would increase by $65 billion.  In 2015, the deficit was $439 billion. In 2016, it increased to $587 billion. The deficit for 2017 was projected to be $559 billion back in January. However, in June that estimate was increased to $693 billion - and this was before Hurricanes Harvey and Irma...or the wildfires out west. I believe we are rapidly approaching a one trillion dollar deficit.  And this is in “good” economic times….can you imagine what will happen when the economy turns south? Think on this for a moment. We are currently in the 3rd longest period of continuous economic expansion in our country’s history, which thus far has lasted eight years. Another two years of expansion would literally be unprecedented.   Several key economic indicators also tend to signal a coming recession. Household net worth to personal disposable income and gross domestic product are both higher than they have ever been. They had previously peaked just prior to the dotcom bubble and then again prior to the real estate bust of 2008 and 2009.  The amount of interest we will have to pay on our national debt going forward will also compound our spending problem. Ten years from now, the Congressional Budget Office projects we will pay $818 billion in interest on that debt...more than we are projected to spend on national defense in that same year.   Finally, I strongly believe that the House budget’s economic growth projections are unrealistically optimistic, just as the Trump budget projections have already been shown to be by the Congressional Budget Office. What does this mean? It means that if we don’t hit these numbers, you add an additional three trillion dollars to the national debt over the next ten years.   In the real world, we adjust our business and family budgets regularly. And in doing so, we may increase one category while we decrease another - that’s the whole idea of a budget. We set priorities and, accordingly, have to adjust things around them. We don't just add to the wish list. Unfortunately, addition - rather than subtraction - formed the basis of this year’s appropriations process. I don't think that approach reflects the spending decisions people along the coast of South Carolina would like to see in Washington, and consequently, I voted as I did.","status",NA,NA,89,77,15,2,0,2,0,8

John Knipper, the head of the neighborhood association, walked through many of their challenges and proposed remedies. From there, I went to the Isle of Palms and met with councilman Jimmy Carroll and others to look at storm damage on the island.   As a consequence of these visits, the debate in Washington, and major storms that have come our country’s way of late, let me touch one last time on these storms and the operative question that comes in the wake of any tragedy: what does it mean, and where do we go from here?   It seems to mean that the irregular is becoming much more regular. The duo of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma was the first of its kind in our nation’s history. Never before have we faced two Category 4 storms that came to our shores near concurrently. Hurricane Irma maintained maximum sustained winds of 185 miles per hour for 37 hours, making it the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record. And Hurricane Harvey set a record for the most rainfall in the continental US with 51.88 inches.  These types of massively destructive storms have in fact become more common in recent decades. While the United States averaged fewer than three, billion-dollar natural disasters per year from 1980 to 1990, it has averaged more than 10 per year since 2010. While we will surely have a protracted debate on this trend and its cause, what is indisputable is that our planet’s weather is becoming more extreme. Again, debate will ensue here on cause and effect, but I think we would be wise to listen to the consensus of scientific opinion on matters tied to science. It strikes me as a touch ironic that many of us will gladly accept scientific opinion on some matters, but quickly discard it when it comes to the question of climate change. On this point, thousands of us lined the beaches of Sullivan’s, Isle of Palms, and different spots in the Lowcountry to watch an eclipse that had been predicted to the minute years ago by scientists…but then we more than doubt what scientists say may be coming our way on ocean level rise and more. My only point here, whether you come from the opinion of man-made or God-made change, is that something seems to be changing and that we ought to take steps to be prepared for it.   On where we go from here, time will tell. There is big emotion around the question of climate change. And I myself have been a skeptic of some of the remedies proposed for the way that they would disadvantage the American economy relative to places like India and China. But there are practical things that we can do that don’t involve the scale or scope of things like the Kyoto Protocols. In short, it’s important that we not go backward.   In this vein, I think that the President’s undoing of the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard to be a mistake. I was an Eagle Scout and part of scouting is being prepared. All that that order said was that federal buildings and federally subsidized infrastructure should take into account things like rising sea levels. Given what I saw out at Shadowmoss yesterday morning, this makes sense to me. It’s not a good public investment to invest in roads that will be perpetually flooded based on sea level rise, whatever its cause.   There are other things that I think need to be done in regard to the federal flood insurance program so that we don’t continuously pay for repeated repairs of the same building. One of the homeowners I spoke with yesterday had bought their house for $150,000 but had already received $220,000 from the federal flood insurance program in repair from four different floodings - and this was even prior to Irma and the latest flooding.   So, the long and the short of it is that I’m acutely interested in what science suggests will be coming our way along the coast of South Carolina - and what we can do proactively to be prepared for what indeed unfolds. I’ll keep you posted as I learn more on both of these fronts and, in the meantime, would love to get your perspectives….","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/photos/a.124615434414913.1073741828.118387985037658/710443559165428/?type=3",NA,136,71,14,5,0,2,1,2

On the personal front, let me double back to the storm...one last time, and this is certainly a hope and prayer with the latest storm building strength now in the Atlantic. My thought is that my heart goes out to all those affected by Hurricane Irma. I have been to flooded homes, to washed out foundations and more in reviewing damage - I even spent a good part of the weekend cleaning up at our family place in Beaufort. Below is a shot of the dock that once was…   And what strikes you about images like these are the memories that any of these structures provided. From the top of the roof of the dock that is now collapsed and down at sea level, each of our four boys have jumped into the water at all ages. Countless dinners and conversations and more with family and friends took place at this gathering point at the farm. We will rebuild, but it will take time, money, and energy...and this is the part I empathize with for the many who have been affected by this storm.  On the professional, last week, I joined Congressman Mike Thompson, Congressman Patrick Meehan, and Congressman Matt Cartwright in leading a bipartisan group of 69 Congressmen in a letter to Chairman Rhonda Schmidtlein of the US International Trade Commission (ITC)...up from 53 last month when we sent the letter for the first time. The letter urged her not to issue new import tariffs on the domestic solar panel industry. We did so because, along with hurting the industry, it would drive the cost of solar up for consumers. And at a time when solar is really beginning to hit new strides, it's important we not go backward.  Tariffs are taxes. At times, we all forget that - but given the degree to which they are being talked about these days in Washington, it's important we all remember it. For that matter, the saying is that if you want less of something…tax it…and I don't think that this is something we want in a viable form of alternative energy like solar. There are indeed no free lunches in life, and often times, the tariff protections that people talk about for a whole host of industries are taxes that hurt each of as consumers.   The letter reads, “We are concerned that the requested trade protection would sharply increase the price of solar panels which could lead to a negative impact across the whole solar industry. The increased costs could slow or even stop solar growth, jeopardizing billions of dollars in investment in communities across the country.”  The ITC is scheduled to vote on this issue on September 22, and I’ll update you from my end as things develop....","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/photos/a.124615434414913.1073741828.118387985037658/711587015717749/?type=3",NA,106,38,11,3,0,5,3,0

May I highlight a handful of them?   An amendment offered by Congressman Jason Smith would deny federal funding to cities and states that choose to openly defy federal immigration laws. This struck me as reasonable because you and I don’t get to pick and choose which laws we will abide by.  I disagree with the amount of taxes I have to pay...but until we change the law, I am not given license to simply ignore them because I disagree with them. Our Founding Fathers envisioned a nation of laws and not men...and part of what this meant was that no one, and no entity, could be above them. That's the only path to equal justice. They cannot be enforced in patchwork form and still function in equal form. Again, this amendment simply says that cities and states cannot use federal funds in contravention of existing federal laws. I therefore voted in favor of the amendment, which passed 225 to 195.  A number of amendments offered by Congressman Steve King would have prohibited any funds appropriated in various sections of the bill from being used to enforce Davis-Bacon wage requirements. The Davis-Bacon Act, now 86 years old, authorizes the payment of a “prevailing wage” for workers on federal construction projects. The original intent was to protect local workers from large national contractors that could offer lower bids for federal projects by bringing in lower-priced workers. However, Davis-Bacon predates the establishment of federal minimum wage laws, other labor protection laws, and a whole host of government regulations concerning fair bidding for contracts. Today, this Act pushes up labor costs for federal construction projects. The Congressional Budget Office estimated it will add $15.7 billion over the next 10 years.  As an example, it looks like, with the higher budget numbers, the military will get started on a number of long-term modernization projects that have spent the past few years on the budgetary backburner. In doing so, Congress owes it to the American people to ensure that their tax dollars are being spent efficiently, and ensuring things cost more does not do this. There were three of these amendments: one specific to the agriculture division, another specific to the transportation, housing, and urban development section, and a third covering the rest of the bill. I voted in favor of all three, but none of them passed.  An amendment offered by Congressman Salud Carbajal echoed my own efforts to block any new oil drilling activities off the Atlantic Coast. In fact, my office submitted a very similar amendment to Mr. Carbajal’s, which unfortunately was blocked from being allowed for a floor vote. By moving ahead, the federal government has decided to ignore more than 120 municipalities, including every single coastal municipality in South Carolina, who have all formally opposed oil and gas development off the Atlantic coast. Whether you are for or against offshore drilling, I think we could all agree that locals should have some degree of voice on matters that affect them. Not all decisions need to be made from Washington. In this case, all we have been asking for is some local authority in determining what happens next in local communities - because the onshore infrastructure necessary to support offshore operations impacts communities onshore. Some cities want the industrial infrastructure necessary to support offshore operations...some don’t.   In all this, the principal is simple…The government closest to the people generally governs best – and, in that regard, we should all pause in thinking about a process in which South Carolina would not have material influence on an issue that might impact tourism and the unique look and feel of our coastline. I therefore voted in favor of the amendment, which failed 177 to 230.  An amendment offered by Rep. Tom McClintock would have eliminated funding for something called the Essential Air Service, which provides subsidies to commuter and regional airlines in order to serve rural airports that are not otherwise economically viable. According to the Transportation Security Administration, in 2014, the Essential Air Service averaged only one-third of total flight capacity for 44 of the 113 routes it covers. One route, which flies round-trip from Kansas City, Missouri to Great Bend, Kansas twice per day, usually serves only one or two people despite receiving approximately $1.4 million per year in subsidies from the Essential Air Service. This program puts taxpayers on the hook for the losses in unprofitable routes. I therefore voted in favor of the amendment, which failed 140 to 280.  There were two amendments that dealt with Amtrak, the government-operated and subsidized passenger rail service. The first, offered by Congressman Mo Brooks, would have eliminated Amtrak’s federal subsidy. Between 2010 and 2015, the federal government provided Amtrak with $40 billion in taxpayer funds. Yet, since it was created in 1971, Amtrak has never turned a profit. Between 2007 and 2011, the federal subsidy for each Amtrak ticket averaged almost $51. Given that approximately 30 million passengers buy Amtrak tickets each year, the total passenger subsidy during that period was approximately $1.5 billion per year. Amtrak lost $600 million between 2006 and 2012 in their food and beverage service alone. It’s time for the federal government to break from the status quo here, and accordingly, I voted for the amendment, which failed 128 to 293.  The second, an amendment offered by Congressman Ted Budd, would have eliminated a $900 million earmark for the upgrade of an Amtrak rail line between Newark, NJ and New York City. The upgrade is part of the larger Gateway project, a $29.5 billion tunnel, bridge, and infrastructure upgrade led by Amtrak to improve passenger rail service between Newark and New York City. This project has been fraught with delays and cost overruns. It is also controversial because it won't increase fare revenues enough to offset its cost in the long run. I voted for the amendment, which failed 160 to 260.  Finally, an amendment offered by Congressman Gary Palmer would have eliminated funding for something called the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Criminal Enforcement Division. Each year, the EPA spends approximately $50 million a year to employ nearly 200 armed federal agents at $216,000 per year, plus benefits, travel, training, and other expenses. Standing side-by-side, it’d be difficult to tell the difference between one of these agents and an Army Ranger. They are equipped with sophisticated guns, ammunition up to 30mm, camouflage, night vision goggles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other pieces of highly advanced, war-fighting hardware.   The EPA is just one of more than 70 federal agencies that now have what can safely be described as para-military enforcement divisions. This militarization of federal agencies is a troubling trend that should not be allowed to continue unchecked.

Mine has entailed visits up toward the Summerville area today, and I’ll be down in Beaufort County tomorrow.   At office hours today up in Summerville, we got into a robust debate on health care, civil liberty, and more….and under the category of debate, I wanted to include an explanation for a few more of last week’s amendments to the omnibus bill.    To start, there were a number of amendments offered to various sections of the bill designed to reduce its overall spending levels. One, offered by Congressman Glenn Grothman, would have cut 5% from the overall budget of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATF), reducing overall spending in the bill by $64.7 million. A second, offered by Rep. Paul Mitchell, would have cut 10% from the salaries, expenses, and administration budgets of several federal agencies and offices funded in the Financial Services and General Government section of the bill, including the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, the White House, the Supreme Court, the Office of Management and Budget, the Bureau of Fiscal Service, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Small Business Administration. In total, this amendment would have reduced overall spending in the bill by nearly $600 million. Finally, a third amendment offered by Rep. Marsha Blackburn would have imposed a 1% cut across the entire Labor, Health, and Human Services section of the bill, resulting in an overall spending reduction of $1.58 billion.   Cutting spending somewhere is vital, but this Congress is unwilling to do it. I voted in favor of all three of these amendments, which would have reduced overall spending in the bill by a combined $2.26 billion, but none of them passed.  There were two noteworthy amendments offered by Rep. Markwayne Mullin of Indiana to the Interior and Environment section of the bill. The first blocks enforcement of an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule requiring oil and gas operators to reduce the amount of natural gas and methane that escapes as a regular consequence of drilling. The main point of this rule is to encourage oil and gas operators to capture the natural gas and methane they would simply vent into the atmosphere. They could instead capture it and sell it. This would be good for the atmosphere and good for energy independence. Often, natural gas and methane produced during drilling is burnt off, as it is less valuable than petroleum and therefore nets less of a profit. The total value of the methane and natural gas burnt off in drilling operations each year is estimated to be $330 million. Capturing and using this gas, which is cleaner burning than petroleum, seems to me reasonable. I voted against the amendment, but it passed, 218-195.  The second Mullin amendment blocks enforcement of another EPA rule called the Social Cost of Carbon. This rule is an attempt by the EPA to put a cost-per-ton on carbon emissions. The cost estimate is predicated on a faulty discount rate for the cost of the regulations associated with preventing emissions. While the historic discount rate is 7%, the Office of Management and Budget recommended 5%, and the EPA opted for 3%. Only with that very low discount rate, along with a multiple-century time horizon, does the regulation pass a cost-benefit analysis. This rule is a prime example of the federal government using fuzzy economic math to justify a burdensome regulation. I therefore voted in favor of this amendment, which passed, 225-186.  An amendment offered by Rep. Ralph Norman would have cut funding for the Environmental Protection Agency by 25%. I saw it as a chance to send a message. A 2016 report by the Government Accountability Office showed the ways in which the EPA has simply refused to inventory personnel...over the last twenty years. How can you effectively administer help, when you don't know where people are in your organization?  This report also showed how the EPA could improve efficiency and reduce costs. For example, funding for grants to organizations at the state and local levels constitutes nearly half of the EPA’s entire budget at $3.9 billion. Yet, the report demonstrated how these grants were subject to very little oversight and are often spent inefficiently. Administrative costs in publically-funded grant programs are routinely higher, as a percentage of a program’s overall budget, than privately-funded programs.   A proposal to reducing funding would  hopefully wake the agency up on the need for accountability. I therefore voted in favor of the amendment, which failed, 151-260.  There were several amendments to the section of the bill dealing with Labor, Health, and Human Services worth mentioning. One amendment offered by Rep. Rosa DeLauro imposes a 63% cut to the general management budget for the Department of Health and Human Services in order to increase the budget for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s mental health programs by 25%. A cut this large to the general management budget would essentially cripple the entire Department of Health and Human Services. The amendment would also make a smaller, offsetting cut to the general management budget for the Department of Education. In other words, it cuts from education funding to help pay for a large increase in mental health services. Although I voted against the amendment, it passed, 225-192.  An amendment offered by Rep. Joe Courtney would have reduced funding for charter schools while increasing funding for magnet schools. Charter schools are privately-run schools that receive some percentage of public funding but are not administered by the public school system. For a variety of reasons, charter schools tend to do better than public schools in terms of student performance, despite spending less per student. Magnet schools are public schools that focus on a specific kind of education style or curriculum, such as Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), Career and Technical Education (CTE), and language immersion. Magnet schools are not bound by traditional district boundaries and can usually enroll students from any part of a public school system. As a result, magnet schools often have long waiting lists. Furthermore, because they are fully public, magnet schools are subject to all the same rules, regulations, restrictions, and costs as regular public schools. To some degree, this amendment pitted one piece of choice against another in education - but given I have long believed in the notion of maximizing choice in education, I voted against the amendment, which failed, 204-212.  An amendment offered by Rep. Jason Lewis would have increased funding for Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs by 4%, with an offsetting reduction of 3.4% to the higher education budget. CTE programs provide academic and technical skills, knowledge and training for career paths that require high levels of technical skill but not necessarily a traditional, four-year liberal arts education. According to the Construction Labor Market Analyzer, the construction industry will face a shortfall of approximately 1.1 million skilled workers over the next decade. Access to high-quality CTE programs will be crucial to making up employment shortfalls in many technical and manufacturing professions. Furthermore, students in CTE programs tend to drop out of school less frequently than average students. The graduation rate for high school students focusing on CTE education is 93%, compared to 80% for all high school students. While I voted for the amendment, it failed, 153-263-1.   Another amendment offered by Congressman Glenn Grothman would have cut $99,000,000 from the budget for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which would have still been allocated $150,000,000 under the bill. Since 1990, the workload of the NLRB has decreased significantly. The NLRB received 65% fewer election petitions and 40% fewer unfair labor practice charges in 2014 than it did in 1990. Despite the decrease in workload, the NLRB’s budget has increased by 15% over that same period of time. While I voted for the amendment, it failed, 175-241.  An amendment offered by Rep. Mark Meadows would have reduced the size of the Coal Mine Safety and Health Program Area of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, which currently includes 964 employees whose annual salaries total $78,970,000. Over the past five years, the number of functioning coal mines in the United States has dropped by 35% and the number of coal miners by 43%. Yet, staffing levels within the Coal Mine Safety and Health Program Area have remained essentially unchanged. Is this not crazy?  If your needs for a service drop, in the real world you make adjustments. Not in government! Forty-three percent less demand…and you keep your employment count the same? While I voted for the amendment, it failed, 178-238-1.  Moving on to the Financial Services and General Government section of the bill, an amendment offered by Rep. Bill Posey would have removed the current Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, John Koskinen. This amendment would have taken advantage of something called the Holman Rule, which allows Congress to essentially fire a federal employee by eliminating funding for their salary. Commissioner Koskinen obstructed the congressional investigation into the targeting of conservative nonprofit groups at the IRS, specifically on two occasions in which he gave false testimony under oath in congressional hearings.   Taking action here is important because one of Congress’s main roles is oversight, and not laying out a consequence for Commissioner Koskinen’s actions is to have hearings with words but no oversight with action. Congressional action also works to prevent executive overreach and helps ensure that the IRS plays by the rules. After all, the business of targeting certain political groups is certainly not the proper role of the IRS. This whole thing is what sickens people about government. A guy lies under oath, but he keeps his job. The president has not done anything here because there is friendship. Congress is the last one standing who might take action, so I voted for the amendment, but it unfortunately failed, 186-223.  Finally, an amendment offered by Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton would have removed language from the bill blocking enforcement of the District of Columbia’s Local Budget Autonomy Act. The Constitution provides Congress “exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over” the District of Columbia. The Local Budget Autonomy Act is an attempt to roll back Congress’s oversight of the District of Columbia’s budget and therefore is in direct conflict with the Constitution. Even the Government Accountability Office has determined that the provisions within the Local Budget Autonomy Act that change Congress’s role in the D.C. budget process have no force of law. The District of Columbia is not a state, nor did the framers of the Constitution intend it to ever become one. Instead, as the seat of the federal government, Washington, D.C. derives real and certain benefits…but they are offset by specific limitations to DC power. Therefore, the federal government’s role in its budget process is wholly appropriate and in accordance with the Constitution. I therefore voted against the amendment, which failed, 186-222.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/photos/a.124615434414913.1073741828.118387985037658/712357275640723/?type=3",NA,49,22,6,0,0,0,0,1

In 1789…  In carving out our rights as Americans…   It was at that time that he introduced and the Congress passed the Fourth Amendment. Its simple words are: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”  The Founding Fathers believed that our privacy was core to the preservation of liberty and accordingly a fundamental constitutional right.  Yet the normal course of things is for liberty and personal freedom to yield to the so-called good intentions of government. It’s for this reason that I have attached the article below that highlights a vote that I took back in July.  Please read the article. This one is important given the way that our constitutional rights are much more fragile than we realize. And though the vote took place back in July, the president signed this bill into law just last week.   At the time of our vote in July, I was one of only five Representatives to vote against the bill along with my colleagues Congressman Justin Amash, Congressman Walter Jones, Congressman Thomas Massie, and Congressman Alex Mooney. At that time, I said:   “Last month, the House passed H.J. Res 76 by a vote of 399 to 5. This resolution would allow Virginia, Maryland, and DC to establish a tri-state Washington Metrorail Safety Commission. Under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress has the authority to permit states and the District of Columbia to enter into interstate compacts. But what Congress doesn’t have the authority to do is authorize compacts that would allow states to conduct warrantless searches of private property. One section of the agreement did just that, and accordingly, I was one of five Republicans to vote no.  “The section in question would have authorized the Metrorail Safety Commission to enter upon any property that is adjacent to the metrorail system for investigations, repairs, and more. This would include any privately-owned lands and premises that happen to be next to the railway. The only restriction on this authority would be that the CEO of the metro transit authority must first give “reasonable notice.” The Founding Fathers didn’t protect us under the Fourth Amendment with a “reasonable notice” standard...they said that absent an ongoing emergency or crime, there needs to be a warrant issued by a judge in order to intrude on folks’ private property.  “The DC metro system is in dire need of improvements, particularly those related to rider safety. In fact, in the last three years alone, there have been three total train derailments. But while it seems reasonable that Congress should work to address these issues as soon as possible, we should be wary of any bill that rolls over private property rights in exchange for a remedy.”  But the more interesting read is in the article, given what they have noticed about that vote that received all-too-little attention. Maybe the president’s signing of this misguided measure will bring greater attention to this latest attack on our personal freedoms.","link","http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-08-26/congress-quietly-passed-bill-allowing-warrantless-searches-homes-only-1-opposed-it","zerohedge.com",67,36,37,0,1,11,5,32

It seems as though there are many opinions but no solidarity on exactly what should come next.   What’s more dangerous in the equation are the number of misconceptions that people have in what it would take to balance the budget. For instance, many people say if we just wiped out foreign aid, we would be well on our way to balancing the budget. Unfortunately, it’ll take a lot more than that, but it’s certainly a perception.   So, here’s an idea, if you have the time. The Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget has put together an interesting computer tool called the “Debt Fixer,” and it allows you to manage the federal budget and find ways to moving us toward balance. In fact, the goal of their exercise is to cut $4.3 trillion from the federal budget within a decade…to bring down the debt to 70% of Gross Domestic Product by 2027, which would put us at a much more sustainable rate of spending.   Give it a try, and I’d love your thoughts….","link","http://www.crfb.org/debtfixer/","crfb.org",63,49,26,1,2,0,0,0

I was one of seven Republicans who voted no, and given it was brought up under what’s called “suspension” - which requires a two-thirds majority for passage, the bill failed.   This simply means that it will be brought back up under normal procedure, and inevitably, most of what the bill was comprised of will pass.   I have voted for some portions of what was contained in the package of bills that this bill represented. For instance, if there had been simply a straight up or down vote to extend the Federal Aviation Administration’s authorization until March, I would have voted for it. This was not the case though, as disaster relief was added to a simple airway extension bill that would have easily passed.   Stopping and slowing the process I thought essential for the following reasons:  One, it deserved debate. Instead, this 60-page bill was introduced on the day that it was brought to a vote, leaving no time for hearings, the possibility of amendments...or even review.  Two, what happens next in disaster relief and flood insurance matters greatly to people along the coast of South Carolina. It matters greatly to each of us as taxpayers, and yet there were a host of unintended consequences that were built into this rushed approach to disaster tax relief.   Let’s examine them for a moment.   Last time I checked, a disaster is a disaster...is a disaster. Yet this bill would actually discriminate against different flood victims and give tax relief to the victims of some storms and not others. This is very important because the homes that I visited last week at Shadowmoss in many cases saw more flood damage than homes in Texas or Florida. But because we were not designated as a major disaster area, there would be no tax relief available for these residents. While we can’t change past law with regard to emergency declaration, the idea of passing new law that codifies different approaches to different storms is not something that I think makes common sense - or attends to the real needs of people who have been hurt in places like Louisiana or South Carolina. Congress should not be in the business of picking winners and losers with regard to storm loss, yet this bill would do exactly that.  It furthermore made the taxpayer liabilities that go with the Federal Flood Insurance Program worse. The saying is that if you’re in a hole and you want to get out, quit digging. This bill did the reverse as it relates to the $24.6 billion debt that has accumulated in the Flood Insurance Program. What it would do for the first time is change the standard for flood insurance so that private insurers could write to a state rather than national standard. On its own, that could be a good thing. In the wake of two Category-4 storms hitting our country near simultaneously (something that’s never happened before) and creating what some say will be more than a $250 billion taxpayer liability, it could be horrendous.   As a practical matter, what this change to flood standards would then mean would be that private insurers could come in and cherry pick lower risk insurance policies. This would leave each of us as federal taxpayers not only with the existing $24 billion debt on the program...but a real cash flow squeeze to boot, based on Harvey and Maria. Think about it: existing premiums paid to the Federal Flood Insurance Program pay the debt on existing borrowings. If some of that money disappears, less money is available to pay the claims that will come not only with these existing storms - but with future storms as well.  So expect to see this one again...hopefully in a way that does less damage to each of us as taxpayers - and possible flood victims along the coast of South Carolina.","status",NA,NA,51,24,17,1,0,0,0,2

But we did that today, as we loaded up in buses at 8:30 am and went to the National Defense University for a summit on tax reform that lasted until 2:00 pm.  It’s an indicator of how important this issue is and the degree to which the House, Senate, and White House have driven a stake in the ground on moving this issue this fall.   We had a lot of Member discussion and a lot of back and forth about the conceptual plan that was rolled out by Congress and then spoken on by the president this afternoon. From this starting point, I’m sure that I’ll have a lot of conversations with you on what you like or don’t like in what’s proposed.  Make no mistake, this will be a huge debate.   Healthcare affects about one-fifth of the economy, the tax code affects 100% of the economy...and our economy disproportionately affects the world economy at large. Given the magnitude of what’s in play here, it will be very important that I get your feedback throughout this process.   At the concept level, there are a couple of major principles at play….  One, tax relief and simplification for working middle class families. If you look at the way wages have stagnated over the last twenty years, it is these folks that need help the most. Furthermore, lobbyists and special interests have carved out a whole host of tax loopholes that do injustice to the concept of fairness and, by their exemption, raise the tax load for the rest of us.  Two, a simpler tax code that promotes competitiveness and job growth. What was talked about would amount to as much as a 40% cut in tax rate for small businesses, as the rate would go from about 40 to 25%. Small businesses are the backbone to job creation in our country, and I believe that help here is important.  Three, a simpler tax code that globally makes us more competitive - and again helps with job growth. We presently have a global system in the way that we tax corporate profits overseas. Our competitors have a territorial tax system that exempts foreign earnings from being taxed twice, and there was much discussion about the way that this leads to corporations moving operations overseas and the way in which that hurts us in the U.S.  The devil will be in the details going forward on what these changes would mean for the deficit, how we collapse to 3 or 4 rates, what a “zero bracket” would look like, what ending the alternative minimum tax or the estate tax will mean next...but all those are details for another post.

Such is the case with the Federal Aviation Administration/disaster tax relief bill that came up on Monday….   I voted against it and, at that time, said it was sure to come back up. Indeed, it did here just two days later, as we voted on it yesterday.   The bill unfortunately got worse.    The discrimination in the way that it pitted some storm victims against others was made worse, as the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were added for extended tax benefits, while a host of other states were still left out.    At some point, we need to go beyond reacting to the latest emergency and think about the ways in which we treat storms, wildfires, and other natural disasters - so that we treat people with the same level of damage to their house...the same. We also need to move away from treating storms and tornados and wildfires as complete emergencies. Doing so means that they are treated differently than other spending, and this ballons our nation's debt and accompanying deficits. They are not surprises. We know for certain that in a country as big as ours we will be hit with some number of storms, tornadoes, and floods. We don't know when or where exactly,  but we know they are coming.   On the category of equal treatment, I want you to stop and think about that for a moment. I don’t know of a person that doesn’t feel for the people of Puerto Rico; it’s become none other than a humanitarian crisis. But these sort of crisis events are not the events that fit with tax relief that may come a year or six months down the road. Immediate aid is needed in Puerto Rico and will be given, but the availability of tax credits in the rebuilding process is something that ought to be available to all Americans as they rebuild from flood or storm damage.    In any case, I voted against this bill again. This time, it passed, but what I’m told is that the flood insurance provisions that I was concerned about (given its impact on the debt and deficit) will be stripped out in the Senate, and it’s the FAA portion that will move forward, as it indeed comes back from the Senate.   If you didn’t catch what I said on the post two days ago in the wake of the first vote, I’ve shared it here.","link","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/posts/714654555410995","facebook.com",31,15,0,2,0,0,1,0

I’ve long believed that much of our present welfare system produces unintended consequences and incentivizes the wrong things. For this reason, I actually voted for the last significant change to our welfare system. At that time, its changes were sweeping, and detractors would have made you think that Congress was trying to throw people into the streets with its enactment. That proved not to be the case, and for a while, the incentives for people to go back to work were meaningful and real. But over different administrations since that change occurred, they have been eroded and diluted.   For that reason, more reform is necessary on welfare. I say this in the broadest sense of the word because there is welfare to those that are needy, and there is also welfare to big corporations. Some parts of these programs needs to end; some parts need to be reformed.  We had a chance this week to reform a part of our present human welfare system, and I voted for it. It passed 214 to 209 and was called the Increasing Opportunity and Success for Children and Parents through Evidence-Based Home Visiting Act. It reauthorized an expiring program that was started by President George W. Bush. It aims to help at-risk pregnant women and young parents, and I voted in favor of the bill because this was our one chance to enact reforms to a measure that is certain to be reauthorized over on the Senate side.    The two reforms that this bill included that I believe made the vote worthwhile were the following:  One, it creates and refines an evidence-based framework for grant recipients. As noted in a recent post, there aren’t many things that are evidence-based in Washington funding. Tying money to outcomes that can be evidenced is something that makes common sense. In this case, the bill calls for monitoring and reporting on performance benchmarks in order to receive continued funding.   There are six specific benchmarks that must see improvement for continued funding. They include: improved maternal and newborn health, prevention of child injuries and abuse, improvements in school readiness and achievement, reduction in crime or domestic violence, improvements in family economic self-sufficiency, and improvements in the coordination of community resources.   This isn’t a perfect or complete list of outcomes, but actually digging in deeper to measure outcomes - and having the outcomes tied to grants - is a place that Washington ought to go much more strongly. It’s what we do in every other area of our lives, as we try and tie input with output.  The second reform that this bill included was a requirement for state matching funds. Previously, this program came as a simple grant. Apply for the money, get it and spend it. As a state, you wouldn’t care that much about outcomes because none of it was “your” money. With this bill, states and localities for the first time would have to put up matching money to draw down federal money. It’s funny how differently people treat money if they have skin in the game...and I thought that this was a meaningful reform step that would come with the bill we just passed.  Again, it’s not a perfect bill, but I think it’s a step in the right direction to improving welfare. Accordingly, I supported it.","status",NA,NA,94,57,14,2,0,0,0,8

Before I do though, let me state the obvious, which is that my thoughts and prayers go to the individuals and families who were affected in the tragedy of Las Vegas.   I’ll have more thoughts on that, but for now, let me go back and explain why I voted “yes” on the Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act. It would prohibit Social Security payments to individuals with outstanding felony warrants or parole and probation violations. Under the category of bringing more common sense to Washington, this should stand out - and accordingly, it passed by a vote of 244 to 171.  Do we not live in a crazy world when you can be a fugitive from justice - literally running from the law and hiding in some foreign country - but still receive Social Security checks?! I think a big part of the mindset that we saw in the election of November was tied to people’s frustrations with the way in which Washington doesn’t work for themselves or their families - that at times, it just doesn’t make sense. Frustration with that utter level of dysfunction is part of what people want to see changed in Washington, and in this regard, this bill should represent low-hanging fruit. Let me say it again: wanted felons shouldn’t be able to avoid prosecution for months - sometimes even years - while receiving monthly checks from the federal government. If you flip it around, you could even say that the status quo means that fugitives can use the American taxpayer to assist them in running from the law.   The bill was also important because it would actually decrease federal spending. Needless to say, that’s not something that happens often enough in Washington, and indeed, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would decrease direct spending by about $2.1 billion over the next 10 years. As a consequence, this spending reduction is being used as a “pay-for” to offset the cost of another bill that I voted for earlier last week, which helps at-risk pregnant women and young children.","status",NA,NA,107,69,12,3,0,2,1,5

The bill passed by a vote of 237 to 189, and I’d like to offer a few thoughts on why I voted as I did in supporting the measure.  There are strong opinions on both sides of the debate, and given the gravity of the issue, it can be very difficult for some people to discuss. In all these considerations, I would simply say that the position I have come to hold has been based on much thought and reflection...along with many conversations with people at home. The issue is also profoundly moving for all of us who have children and as one watches the unfolding of the miracle that is life.   When the Founding Fathers enshrined the guarantee of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, they regarded life as a core right that government would protect. Thomas Jefferson emphasized this point when he said, “the care of human life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only object of good government.”    The bill would prohibit elective abortions after 20 weeks post-fertilization because unborn babies can feel pain at that stage. The bill also provides an exception for cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at risk. It also requires medical care for infants born alive after attempted abortion procedures.   It seems logical that as science advances and we learn new things about human physiology, our laws should reflect these advances.  Indeed, in its various decisions, the Supreme Court has determined when states may regulate abortion. Under Roe v. Wade that determination was the third trimester (about 28 weeks). Then, in a later decision, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court set the limit based on the idea of when the fetus can survive outside the womb, also known as viability. The Roe decision came in 1973 and the Casey decision came in the early 1990s. Now, given more recent research showing that the unborn can feel pain at least as early as 20 weeks...indeed, pediatric anesthesia is routinely given during fetal surgeries in recognition of that, I think it reasonable to revisit the laws currently on the books. I would also note that our society has an interest in not inflicting unnecessary pain if it can avoid doing so.  It will now go to the Senate, where getting 60 votes will be difficult. But if the bill does indeed pass the Senate, it will then go to the president, who has said he would sign it into law.","status",NA,NA,388,287,54,46,1,2,5,86

Put simply, that shouldn’t be the case. Deficits matter when we’re spending taxpayer money just as much as they matter when we’re trying to save taxpayer money; it’s just two sides of the same coin.  If we want to avoid a looming financial crisis, sustainability in spending practices and economic growth need to be hallmarks of any budget proposal Congress puts forward.

Let me say it again. I would ask that you remember this simple computation: savings drive investment...which drives productivity gain...which drives standard of living, or what we would call wages for most working folks.   This is important because everyone in politics talks about the last step in the process...but very few talk about how you get there.   In fact, seemingly no one is talking about it in Washington because at the core both Republican and Democratic budgets - and the federal spending that they represent - are essentially consumption budgets. Most federal spending is on automatic pilot - but given the debate, you would think that the budgets are radically different. It’s unfortunately not the case. Regardless of which budget prevailed, most spending would still be on automatic pilot and focused on consumption. It’s all by small degrees….  But small steps do matter because higher federal debt tends to crowd out private investment over time. With less investment, the workforce is less productive, and this indeed negatively affects wages. As the Congressional Budget Office says, “because wages are determined mainly by workers’ productivity, the reduction in investment would reduce wages as well, lessening people’s incentive to work.”  I had a little to say on this front earlier and would be curious to get your thoughts.…","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/videos/718037271739390/",NA,103,75,23,2,0,0,0,13

Such was the case this past week at the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Railroads Subcommittee. There, I had questions for Mr. Wick Moorman, the co-CEO of Amtrak. The mushiness of the way in which there is no answer is evident in the video, and I think it’s interesting that Amtrak hasn’t once turned a profit since its creation in 1971.   All this should matter to each of us as taxpayers because government funds are used to subsidize Amtrak...just as it does many other parts of government. Indeed, between 2010 and 2015, the federal government provided Amtrak with $40 billion in taxpayer funds. Between 2007 and 2011, the federal subsidy for each Amtrak ticket averaged almost $51. At about 30 million passengers per year, the total passenger subsidy during that period was approximately $1.5 billion per year. In their food and beverage service alone, Amtrak lost $600 billion between 2006 and 2012.  A business can’t operate at a loss for more than 45 years...Amtrak shouldn’t either….","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/videos/718409525035498/",NA,187,119,96,3,7,33,6,48

In that vein, yesterday, the House passed its budget resolution for 2018.  This could be recorded as unusual because when people normally think about a budget, they think about a budget. You sit down with your business partners, and you decide that you can spend so much in this area and so much in that area. Then, you indeed spend accordingly in those areas.  The opposite has happened this year. The House has finished the appropriations “spending” for the year...and now we’re passing a budget!  In layman’s terms, what this means is that this year’s budget has little to nothing to do with the normal budget process, and instead everything to do with setting up a vehicle for tax reform. It was for this reason - and this reason only - that I voted for the budget. Getting slightly more technical, what the budget does is it allows for a narrower margin in the passage of tax reform through the Senate. It means 50 + 1 for passage rather than what amounts to a 96% margin necessary for passage in the Senate. Even 50 + 1 doesn’t guarantee movement, but it decidedly tips the scales in greater favor of tax reform.  It’s important because it hasn’t happened in 30 years, and as assuredly as our computers are updated, so too should our tax system. Think about it - the world has become increasingly global in the way that we connect one to the other. Yet our tax system is woefully antiquated in this regard, and as a consequence, many corporations have found it more profitable to move overseas than to stay domiciled in the United States. So, tax reform is in many ways about simplicity for the individual, jobs and economic growth, and competitiveness in our tax structure. There are a whole host of other bells and whistles ranging from the estate tax, to the individual exclusion, to a territorial tax system rather than a global tax system for businesses...but all of those things will be debated over the weeks and months ahead.   The thing that will allow that debate to take place is oddly enough this budget. As I’ve already indicated, I think that that is its only redeeming feature. You could call it a budget, a train leaving the station, a vehicle or a variety of other things, but it was indeed about that one thing this year.  This is not to say that the budget and its considerations aren’t of the greatest importance going forward. To the point of being blue in the face, we are walking our way towards a financial crisis if we do nothing about government spending.   Much celebrated in this budget was the fact that it touched mandatory spending for the first time in over 10 years...but even this was largely a mirage. It proposed to cut $203 billion in mandatory spending over the next 10 years. That sounds good, until you consider the fact that our government will spend about $34 trillion over the same time period. That’s .0088% of spending! And even that could be back-ended to year 9 or 10...which means it’ll never happen.   Think about it yet another way. Our country will run a deficit of about $750 billion this year. If you annualized the mandatory spending cuts that are contemplated over the 10-year window, you’d be looking at $20 billion a year in cuts to mandatory spending. $20 billion in savings out of a $750 billion a year shortfall. Let me say that again...$20 billion in savings out of a $750 billion a year shortfall.   Are you kidding me?  That’s a 2% cut from the $750 billion addition to the national debt each year. You can’t dig your way out of a hole in this way, and it's for that reason that this budget indeed was not real from a budgetary standpoint. Sadly, the Progressive and Democratic budgets were even worse on the spending front. The Republican Study Committee budget was more robust in the way it attempted to trim the sails of spending, and I voted for it.  I’ll keep you posted, as things continue to develop.","status",NA,NA,44,57,13,0,0,3,1,14

Exploitation includes crimes like sex trafficking and child pornography.   Without doubt, the internet has become a major part of daily life. It is often a force for good...we can communicate and share information with anyone in the world in an instant. But it’s sadly no surprise either that criminals and would-be criminals also use the internet, as they seek to do harm to children. Indeed, last year alone, the task forces reauthorized by this bill conducted some 61,000 investigations and made more than 9,300 arrests for these types of crimes.     This bill will help law enforcement continue to fight crimes against children through an integrated strategy that provides training and support across all levels of government. It also provides grants to state task forces that conduct investigations and prosecute criminals. Since 2008, DOJ has been instructed to build a nationwide data system which would provide law enforcement a secure undercover network to conduct online investigations and share information - such as on high-priority suspects - in real-time.   That’s the good news. The bad news on this issue come in two forms. One, according to a government report, there have been challenges to getting a useable system up and running. I will be watching here to see what further changes come with this reauthorization on that front.  The second challenge is more profound, and for that reason, I struggled with this vote. If it had just been about federal grants to local and state law enforcement, I would have voted no. Regardless of how great the cause, the federal government cannot remain the mothership on funding a host of worthy priorities. The federal government should do what only the federal government can do.  And this is where it became delicate. There is a role for the federal government in interstate activities. Given the ways in which internet traffic crosses not only state lines but nation state lines as well, I thought the bias in the vote was tipped to the yes column and, accordingly, voted as I did.    It passed the House on a 417 to 3 vote and previously by unanimous consent in the Senate. It will now go to the president for his signature.","status",NA,NA,24,17,3,0,0,1,0,0

I get it that people have suggested it’s time to move on from this subject, but I did find The Post and Courier editorial on this very point timely.  What they pointed out was the obvious. Anything that can be used against you will be used against you in the world of politics, and on this issue, the president is handing Democrats an issue that I suspect we’ll hear much on as the tax debate heats up.  I am most hopeful about the possibility of tax reform for its implications in our lives and the economy at large. Accordingly, I think that Republicans need to do everything that they can to take extraneous issues off the table.

Once vibrant economies - like Venezuela’s - have been crushed under the weight of bad policy choices, and it’s a reminder to everyone of us how much government really does matter.  It’s kind of like oxygen. When you don’t need it, you don’t think about it...but try a few moments without it, and you’re gasping fast.  The analogy I’m trying to draw applies to today’s vote on a disaster relief package. It is bad policy that will make things worse. It included loans for Puerto Rico, money to fight western state wildfires, and the canceling of $16 billion in National Flood Insurance Program debt.   It set a number of bad precedents that each of us as taxpayers should be very concerned about. In fact, I think it set the seeds of financial disregard that will in time morph reaction to the current disaster in Puerto Rico to financial destruction for each of us as taxpayers here in the states.   Let me explain.  One, it simply cancels $16 billion of National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) debt. Let me say that again, it simply cancels $16 billion of National Flood Insurance Program debt.   Are you kidding me? If solving our debt problem was as easy as simply wishing it away, we could all be millionaires and the federal government would be running a surplus! Unfortunately, there is a thing called gravity...and it works. There’s also a thing called math, and it works too. In the world of accounting, debits have to equal credits. In short, one plus one has to equal two. Yet only in Washington can people be so dreamy as to believe that we can just wish away $16 billion dollars. In fact, the money does not disappear. It is simply moved on the ledger from the trust fund to the national debt. This is crazy. Nothing got erased. Nothing got cancelled. The accounting entry was simply moved from the trust fund to the national debt that you and I own and owe. This was nothing more than moving something from your left pocket to your right pocket, and pretending that the process of doing so made the money disappear.  More to the point, it’s horrible precedent. It’s never been done here before, and I have a sneaking suspicion that this precedent will be used in other instances with equally harmful effect to the money that each of us are liable for with the national debt.   Two, it loaned the government of Puerto Rico $4.9 billion. Again, are you kidding me? The government of Puerto Rico has declared bankruptcy and is currently operating under the control of a financial control board. This again is a Washington trick. Something that is in no way a loan is labeled as such so that the financial effect of the bill doesn’t show up. It would have been one thing to say that we were making a grant to the government of Puerto Rico based on the disaster that has taken place. It’s another to try and fake out the taxpayer by labeling something a loan that has zero chance of being repaid.   Three, this bill upended the democratic process that is built into congressional committees. Jeb Hensarling, the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee, gave an impassioned plea a few days ago at the Republican Conference that we include the reforms to the national flood insurance program that had passed his committee. In fairness, I’m not a fan of all of those reforms, but if we’re ever going to stem the tide of red ink in the way we fund emergencies, we have got to make reforms to the system. There is no greater chance of enacting reform than at the time that you’re going to offer sweeteners to the constituencies that will be affected by reform. This was one of those moments, and we let it pass.   More significantly, though, leaving aside the merits and demerits of what was in their reform package, is a larger debate on democratic principles. Congressional committees are representative. They’re not perfect, but they take from a variety of different perspectives and come to a conclusion. If we don’t stick with the bottom-up approach in the way that ideas are dealt with in Congress, we’re left with something much less democratic - and that’s decisions from the top. That’s a whole lot closer to autocracy than democracy, and this bill had a lot of it when leadership can go around committee findings and pick and choose the things that go into a bill like this.   Finally, this bill was not paid for. This was not the final hangup for me; it was simply the last straw on a pile of straws that had already broken the camel’s back. Accordingly, I voted no...along with 68 of my Republican colleagues, but the bill passed anyway by a vote of 353 to 69.","status",NA,NA,82,107,17,1,1,2,6,17

At that time, they got a few billion in financial consideration for the promise of better behavior. The benefits went to North Korea, but their promises of changed policies never materialized. In the present case with Iran, the same mirage of consideration for promises of distant changes is here, and I am just as skeptical. With this deal, we would authorize immediate sanction relief of up to $150 billion. In exchange, we get watered-down transparency and flaccid accountability requirements.

The point of the article was that if you care about the deficit, you should care about tax cuts too. Obviously, there’s a larger conversation on this front to be had on size, scale and pay-for for a tax cut, but at this point let me simply zero in on what the Journal was referencing - the newest Congressional Budget Office report.   What that report shows is that the deficit ballooned this year to $668 billion. That is an $82 billion increase over $586 billion deficit of last year and represents the second time that deficits have now gone up after subsiding for the preceding couple of years. The trend line is beginning to move decidedly in the wrong direction, and no one is really talking about the ways in which we’re headed to a ¾ of a trillion dollar deficit this year.  In any case, what was interesting about the editorial was their examination of the way that revenue growth has been relatively flatlined in this economic expansion versus economic expansions of the past. Spending rose 3% for the year, which is far above the wages most of us have seen in the private sector...but as they put it: “penurious” by federal standards. On the opposite side of the ledger, revenue climbed by just one percent over the year...and it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to know that if you grow your spending at 3% and your income by 1%, bad things happen to your pocketbook...or in this case, your federal deficit.  Here’s what I had to say….","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/videos/722354097974374/",NA,42,46,6,0,1,1,0,5

Given the fairly longstanding economic woes of the island, I think it’s important in that whatever we do it be lasting. The saying is feed a man for a day, help him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and feed him for a lifetime.   Too often, government will come in and offer temporary assistance that solves the problem of the day but, in some cases, can leave people more reliant on government than was the case before. It’s for these reasons that I have been so intrigued by the conversation that has come up on the Jones Act in wake of the disaster that has hit Puerto Rico.   For those of you who don’t know, the Jones Act was formerly known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920. It’s a century-old regulation that requires any good that is shipped from one American port to another be transported on a ship that was built in America, be at least 75% owned by Americans, and have a crew that is at least 75% American citizens.  The president waived the Jones Act for ten days, so goods and aid might more freely come onto the island. This is especially important given that Puerto Rico has to import 90% of its food, energy, and more...and it was the U.S. International Trade Commission that found the Jones Act represents a 65% tariff on items like these. That tariff has very much taxed the island’s economy, and many argue that it is part of the reason Puerto Rico has not been able to remain competitive relative to other islands in the Caribbean.  What’s important about all this is not only helping Puerto Rico, but the way that it reminds all of us of how tariffs, duties, and protectionist measures indeed come at a cost. Nothing is free in life, and the protection of one job often means the destruction of another. It was, in fact, President Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisors that pointed to the fact that each job saved with the Jones Act cost an eye-popping $250,000 to each of us as Americans.  So, we can have a longer debate about what one likes or doesn’t like about the Jones Act and other ways in which we might help the island of Puerto Rico - but it’s worth stopping for a moment and thinking about the cost of protectionism, given some of the things the administration has said about moving forward on this front. The Jones Act didn’t have its intended effect, which I would argue is more often than not the case with protectionism. The number of American ships has indeed declined from 2000 to 2016 from 193 to 91 ships.  Over in the Senate, Senators Mike Lee and John McCain have introduced legislation to permanently exempt Puerto Rico from the Jones Act, and in the House, Gary Palmer has introduced a bill that would create a five-year exemption for Puerto Rico, and I joined onto his bill last week.","status",NA,NA,116,60,14,2,1,2,0,1

In comparison, the United States sends around $3 billion a year.   They both get the same vote in the United Nations General Assembly.  In that vein, last week I came across the chart below that details how much each member of the United Nations contributes to the overall UN budget. In essence, the UN decides how much each member country chips into the budget based on that country’s gross national income...the more your economy produces, the more you pay in.   As it stands, the economy of the United States accounts for roughly 36% of the world’s gross income, and we contribute the maximum contribution of 22% of the UN’s overall budget. By comparison, China has a booming economy that makes up 38% of the world’s gross income, yet amazingly only chips in for a total of 8% of the budget. Countries like Eritrea obviously contribute far less.  What President Trump has been asking here of places like China or India strikes me as most reasonable given the growth of their economies.

We also tend to forget the consequences of perpetually spending beyond our means.   A poster child for these two themes came out a few weeks ago in an article in TIME Magazine, where it talked about the possibility of civil war breaking out in Venezuela….  This once-rich country is now a humanitarian crisis on its way to the possibility of civil war and much more...as a consequence of soaring inflation and severe food shortages.  In 2013 when one bolivar was worth four cents, Venezuelan inflation was already considered out of control, but those rates pale in comparison to current inflation rates. Today, one bolivar is less than one penny, and inflation is expected to rise around 720% this year and over 2,000% next year.   In response to rising inflation, President Nicolas Maduro hiked wages by 60% in May, raising the minimum wage to 200,000 bolivares per month...the equivalent of less than $50. Even with this wage hike, citizens still can’t afford basic grocery items. For example, a basket of eggs, milk, and fruit costs around four times the new minimum wage.  The high cost of food is a direct result of the Venezuelan government’s policies that have focused on exporting oil and abandoned food production on abundant farm lands. In spite of these expansive farm lands, Venezuela imports the vast majority of its food. But even when oil prices were high, this policy was barely viable. In just the last year alone, the average Venezuelan living in poverty lost about 19 pounds due to lack of food.

That it represents people’s basic fears and concerns about where our society is headed. While the First Amendment may grant us the right to say most anything at most anytime, basic levels of respect and reverence have held us back from at times doing things that would legitimately be considered offensive to others. When a mom has lost a son in the Middle East, they take it personally when someone decides to not observe an anthem or a flag that symbolizes the sacrifice that in this case was their son. Again, it’s not about one’s constitutional right to do it, but rather what the Bible talks about in all things being lawful but not all things being wise.  One could make the same observations about the recent Boy Scout decision. We certainly live in a time that is changing, and while all of it may be lawful...I don’t know that all of it’s wise.  Which brings me to an amicus brief that I signed on to a bit ago. Not being a lawyer, I didn’t know what the word meant, but an amicus brief is a legal document filed in court cases by non-litigants with a strong interest in the subject matter. The brief advises the court of relevant, additional information or arguments that the court might wish to consider.  In this case, I joined with 85 members of Congress in support of Jack Phillips’ First Amendment rights, and it fits into this larger question of what world are we living in these days.  This case is actually going to be taken up by the Supreme Court in December, and it’s called Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Human Rights Commission. In this case, Mr. Phillips is a very religious man who as a baker wouldn’t include alcohol in his recipes, wouldn’t do things that celebrated Halloween, and more.   One could agree or disagree with his personal beliefs, but by all accounts they seem to be strongly held.   Along comes a couple who happen to be gay, and they asked him to bake a wedding cake. He in essence says I’ve got nothing against you, but based on my religious beliefs, I don’t feel comfortable baking the cake. It’s gone to the Supreme Court from there, but it will have big implications going forward on what religious liberty does or doesn’t mean in the United States.  We’re treading on very fragile ground right now as a society because the First Amendment should certainly free people to express themselves as they see fit...but it shouldn’t sanitize what we like and what we don’t like in what others say. What we can’t do is say that it’s okay for Colin Kaepernick of the 49ers to stand in protest to the National Anthem and consider that free speech, but then not allow a person for their strongly held religious beliefs to say that my right to self expression includes my right to do or not to do things I believe in. The two don’t go together, but that’s not what the world we live in seems to be saying these days - and for that reason, it really is a problem.  In any case, I’ve attached a copy of the amicus brief below, and I thought you might like to take a look.","link","http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/16-111_tsac_US-senators-and-reps.pdf","scotusblog.com",247,182,42,10,3,1,5,37

Such is the case with federalism, the idea that the government most local to the people should have a voice. The Founding Fathers were in fact explicit about stating that those powers not specifically reserved for the federal government were to be controlled by state and local government...and even me and you as individuals. It’s a great concept, but it’s a difficult one.  I say this because people like the idea, but oftentimes when something comes along that they don’t like, they don’t mind having the federal government supercede state and local government to advance their belief. But that’s not federalism.  This idea very specifically applies to marijuana policy, wherein many states have legalized its medical use, and yet federal policy still works against what the states have decided. Whether you’re for or against the medical use of marijuana matters less than whether we really subscribe and adhere to the founders’ belief in federalism...because it was one of the key balancing tools to offsetting an overgrown and controlling federal government. In short, even with ideas we may not like, it’s important to adhere to federalism if you believe in limiting the size of our federal government.  It’s for that reason that I cosponsored the Small Business Tax Equity Act of 2017, introduced by Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-FL). This bill would allow businesses who legally sell marijuana within a state to make the same deductions offered to other businesses. The principle here is simple, if a state makes something legal...it ought to be treated on par and equally with other legal businesses in the state.  In just the last year alone, 28 states passed laws allowing for the legal use of medical marijuana, but because marijuana is classified as a Schedule I substance, small businesses in the states that sell marijuana legally are not allowed to deduct business expenses.   Again, federalism is hard...but I think the Founding Fathers got the combination right in recognizing that all knowledge and wisdom did not disseminate from Washington. States should be allowed to try different approaches, some will work, some won’t...and in that process, ideas will be tested and our country can be the better for it. At minimum, states will be more than rubber stamps for an all-knowing and all-powerful federal government...exactly as the Founding Fathers planned.","status",NA,NA,112,38,20,6,0,0,0,0

The result is a de facto national ID card that should scare every one of us because centralized databases holding personal information have never been synonymous with liberty. Come to think of it, they’ve never even been sympathetic to the liberty our Founding Fathers promised each one of us. And make no mistake, civil liberty - the ability to have some level of privacy with our personal information and the electronic effects of what we say and how we say it - is a key tenant to the larger notion of liberty.  In short, the personal information that is required with a driver’s license has been capably handled by 50 states for a long number of years and doesn’t need to be centralized and controlled by the federal government. And it’s for this reason that I pushed as hard as I have for a long number of years against our country moving in this direction.  On this point, our state and more importantly liberty had a win - or at least a holding action - just last week when South Carolina and 16 other states were given a year-long extension for complying with the REAL ID law...until October 10, 2018.  I fought this issue back as Governor with then-Democratic Governor of Montana Brian Schweitzer, and we were successful in lessening the impact of the law. It was then a $17 billion unfunded federal mandate on states and, if not deferred or stopped, will amount to yet another federal usurpation of state authority.  Accordingly, I sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security last year requesting an extension in compliance with this law. And I introduced a bill earlier this year - the REAL ID Privacy Protection Act. This bill would eliminate the REAL ID program’s most problematic provisions, specifically the ones requiring your sensitive personal documents to be digitally archived for at least a decade in a centralized database.   At the very least, this extension will provide our states with more time to find a legislative solution.   I continue to think that the federal government should not force states to issue what amounts to a national ID card. For a bit more information, I’ve attached a copy of the press release that we sent out on this past November 16 with the accompanying letter that went to then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson.","link","https://sanford.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/sanford-requests-9-month-extension-to-comply-with-real-id-requirements","sanford.house.gov",190,89,60,12,2,3,3,15

The amendment was actually a whole budget in itself, which replaced the original House-passed text entirely. In other words, the vote was really on the Senate’s budget. While it passed, 216 to 212, I voted no, and I write to offer a little explanation as to why.  In my view, this was an incredibly important vote.  At one level, it was nothing more than a vehicle for tax reform. It’s for this reason that I had supported the House budget twice - both in its passage out of committee and on the floor. In fairness to many of my colleagues, this is why many voted as they did today.  But at another level, it had real significance in signaling which way Congress intends to go on the larger issue of spending. The old saying is “if not now, then when,” and this certainly applies on budgetary matters that have been deferred, deferred, and deferred. As I have said many times, I really do believe that as a nation we are at a crossroads financially. If we do not get our house in order, the financial markets will do it for us, and the history of this process has been brutal for taxpayers that have been subjected to it over the ages.  Financial discipline is a topic that has been pushed aside by both parties for far too long. And while both parties may have been well-intended in eventually getting to it, the road to hell really is paved with good intentions.   So that brings us to this vote. Here is why I felt I had to vote “no” at the end of the day on this one.  We can’t abandon what we believe in to get what we want. Many of us want tax reform, but does financial discipline have to be sacrificed on the altar to getting there? I thought Republicans were the party of lower taxes…and less spending. We may certainly defer or delay things we believe in getting to things we want, but there is a point beyond which deferral becomes inaction. And I think that the Senate budget represented that tipping point.   Republicans and conservatives have always talked about the need for limited government and government living within its means - the question is do we believe it? The House budget at least attempted movement in that direction, as for instance there were $203 billion in mandatory spending cuts. This type of cut would have represented the first effort to do so in the last 13 years. The Senate budget took that number down to $1 billion. I’d ask you to think about that for a second. The federal budget proposes to spend about $53 trillion over the next 10 years. $1 billion is less than two one-thousandths of a percent of $53 trillion. Let me say that again. $1 billion is less than two one-thousandths of a percent of $53 trillion. Are you serious about cutting anything in your budget if you’re only cutting two one-thousandths of one percent? This is particularly the case if you’re already more than $20 trillion in the hole, and well over $100 trillion in the hole when one includes the accumulated political promises of Washington in things like Medicare or Social Security.  The House proposal on mandatory spending was very lean...but it at least represented a small start to addressing that which is unaddressed in Washington. The president and Democrats have said we won’t touch it...but the numbers point to the fact that we have to, and the House budget in very modest form at least began that process. To do nothing was part of the straw that broke the camel’s back in my view of looking at this budget.  Similarly, the House budget balanced over 10 years. In contrast, the Senate budget proposed never balancing. On that proposition alone, you have to stop and ask yourself what is the principle we stand for here on financial matters? In the House debate just a matter of months ago, I joined other Republicans in deriding the progressive and Black Caucus budgets that proposed to never balance. We can’t say one thing and do another on that principle of the importance of balance in our federal books.  I could go on to other things that concern me on the financial front...for instance, the Senate budget broke whatever little financial restraint still exists in Washington in the form of caps, it raised the deficit next year by $147 billion, and it paved the way for borrowing in making tax cuts possible. But I think you get my larger point with regard to walking the walk on spending.  Let me add this postscript on this spending point, we are now in the second-longest economic recovery in American history. Trees do not grow to the sky. They have a stopping point and so do economic expansions. This expansion is now double the average of expansions in the past, and it makes this budget that much more important in signaling financial restraint. When the economy next slows, there will be all kind of reasons to spend more in Washington. And at some point, I believe in the next 10 years if not rectified, we will reach the point of no return in the growth of our debt outpacing the growth of the economy that supports it.  So in summary, words matter. They give us direction and a path. For me, things like the Bible or the Constitution point to true north on where we want to go. They may not be perfectly adhered to, but the clarity on where they would have us go matters. So it is with the budget. And while this one was indeed a vehicle for tax reform, as Republicans, we shouldn’t abandon a clear roadmap to where we want to go on spending. As much as the House budget tried to find a middle ground between some small measure of financial restraint and being a vehicle for tax reform, the Senate budget abandoned that restraint. Doing so at this critical point in the business cycle sends terrible signals as to where Congress will go next on spending and makes our wallets and purses very vulnerable to Washington raids with the next downturn in our economy. For all these reasons, I believed it was important to vote “no.”","status",NA,NA,99,89,28,1,0,4,3,10

It happens to be absolutely gorgeous, but that's in great contrast to the way in which Hurricane Irma in particular hit Beaufort county not-so-many weeks ago.  In this light, king tides are a growing phenomena in places like Beaufort or Charleston.    And the data backs this up. In Charleston, for instance, there were fewer than five days of flooding annually in the late 1950, but just last year, there were a record 50 days of flooding.   That’s bad enough. Then, add to the equation the increasing annual costs associated with these more intense and more frequent floods. What this equals is drastically rising damage costs….  Accordingly, earlier this month, I led a letter signed by 14 of my colleagues to Director Mick Mulvaney of the Office of Management and Budget and Director Gary Cohn of the National Economic Council, asking the administration to improve our federal flood-ready infrastructure standard.   This is needed because our current, federal flood risk management standard is a relic of the Carter administration. From a numbers standpoint, what may have worked in the 1970s no longer works today. It's a bad deal for the taxpayer.  Nationally, from 1980 to 1990, flood damages cost the taxpayer about $53 billion, but in 2005 alone, flood damages cost the taxpayer $55 billion. And who knows what the final costs associated with Harvey, Irma, and Maria will be?  Simply put, a stronger flood-ready standard would help to ensure that when disasters strike, taxpayer dollars haven’t been wasted on public infrastructure that can’t stand up to hurricanes like we’ve seen this year.  It was Benjamin Franklin who once said, “if you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.” And on the backs of two Category-4 hurricanes hitting our country at nearly the same time - something that has never been seen before in the history of our republic, it would make sense that the government start to better prepare federal infrastructure for major disasters.   The process of flooding and rebuilding has become increasingly costly, as taxpayer dollars are being spent to rebuild or repair public infrastructure - sometimes multiple times. It makes no sense to go through this cyclical and costly process when the simple step of strengthening the federal flood standard can save taxpayer money and protect our communities. Indeed, every dollar invested in pre-disaster mitigation saves $4 in avoided future damages.

According to recent estimates, governments around the world have accumulated $63 trillion of debt...with the United States making up almost one-third of that amount. As you can see in the chart, the United States makes up a more significant percentage of the global debt than the next three counties combined. To put this into perspective, if you were to divide the over $20 trillion of national debt among our citizens, each person would owe an estimated $63,000.

I was in two more meetings today on the subject, and there will continue to be a host of briefings by committee staff into next week.  Given the speed of movement, we really are in a “speak now or forever hold your peace” setting with regard to the bill. Many of you have sent back thoughts and feedback here and in the survey, and that’s been most helpful.  That which has been described as tax simplification at this point seems very complex, as I go through the 400-plus pages that make up this bill. There are parts for everyone to both love and hate, but let me throw out a few more policy items in the bill and solicit further comment.  One, this bill eliminates the alternative minimum tax. The alternative minimum tax impacted 5 million taxpayers in 2017 and $37 billion in additional taxes due to the alternative minimum tax itself. Part of simplification in this bill is its elimination, and I’d be curious to hear your thoughts on that.  Two, mortgage interest deductibility would be changed. Existing mortgages, whether on a primary home or a secondary home, would be grandfathered...but going forward the mortgage interest deductibility would be limited to primary homes with mortgages at or below $500,000. Currently, deductibility ends at mortgages above $1 million. This could be a big deal given the number of vacation homes up and down the coast of South Carolina. Some people have said that it’s not that big a deal, given the way in which a second home could be constructed as a separate business and LLC, but I’d welcome your thoughts on this front.  Three, local property tax deductibility would be limited to $10,000 or below. This has become a particularly big issue with many folks in the northeast...but again, given the property tax of many second homes on the coast of South Carolina, I’d be curious to hear your thoughts here.  Four, small business pass-through income changes. Currently, if you have a small business (an LLC, partnership, or sole proprietorship), you are taxed at one’s individual tax rate. In this instance, what they have done is to lower the tax rate for small businesses to 25%...but obviously some people may be in a higher tax bracket than the small business rate would suggest. In this case, they’re dividing the baby by allocating 70% of the income to the individual’s tax rate, and the other 30% to the 25% rate that applies for small businesses. There are a few exceptions to this bill, but by-and-large, that’s the split.   I won’t overwhelm you with a lot of other provisions, but these are four that jumped out at me...and, as I said, I’d be curious to hear your thoughts.","status",NA,NA,150,273,39,5,2,4,5,35

Government has a way of crowding in. Most of the time, it’s nothing dramatic...just small little steps to limit our choices and limit our ability to make decisions based on money that leaves our wallet and heads to government.   Such was the case last week in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee.   A bill was offered that created a requirement for 100% domestic content for American flags flown on federal property. At some level, that sounds patriotic. But at another level, it’s yet another small mandate that cost every one of us as American taxpayers.   Will our civilization rise or fall based on domestic content in a flag? Certainly not. Is it a truly big deal from the standpoint of cost? Again, certainly not. But it represents the ever-growing cancer of government’s reach and control.   This is a hard one because I get the attraction to building all things in America. It not only sounds patriotic but, in the case of military armament, is necessary in maintaining a supply chain that cannot be interrupted in times of war. We don’t want our machine guns made in China or our F-35s built in Russia. But for things that are not essential to our industrial production and military readiness, we really do need to include cost in our list of considerations.  It was David Ricardo, who lived in the late 1700s and early 1800s, who came up with the theory of comparative advantage. He observed that a country could in fact become wealthier by doing the things it did best and outsourcing the things that were done better in other places. For instance, we may be able to grow sugarcane in South Carolina, but our winters are such that we don’t grow it nearly as well as the Dominican Republic. We become wealthier as a nation by buying sugarcane from them and instead growing peaches or pecans, which the DR can’t grow.  Protectionism seems to be in vogue these days, and it’s something that occasionally directly limits choices for Americans. But more often, it simply raises the cost of the product and, in so doing, limits other choices by consumers, as they have to spend more on that product and consequently can spend less on something else. In fact, the Peterson Institute for International Economics calculated that the Obama Administration’s tariffs on Chinese tires cost American consumers at least $900,000 for every job they saved for one year.   If we care about freedom, this notion of protectionism is something we should push against for its corrosive effects on these fronts.  A little clip from last week’s debate is attached. I lost in my efforts, but it’s again something that we should all occasionally think about on where we want things to go on this front.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/videos/730776680465449/",NA,107,49,25,2,0,1,0,4

It was interesting the way in different forms it came up twice last week in hearings.  I’ve included a video of the interaction I had with FEMA and Coast Guard representatives at a Transportation & Infrastructure Committee hearing discussing relief efforts in Puerto Rico.  As you may know, the president by executive order exempted shipments to Puerto Rico from the Jones Act for 10 days in the early stages of disaster response. Since then, the Jones Act, which requires American-crewed ships in moving commerce between American ports, has been reinstated, and it comes at considerable cost to the island of Puerto Rico.   That’s obviously a problem in a place in as much of a financial pickle as they are. The Manhattan Institute has calculated that gasoline costs 15 cents more per gallon as a result of the Jones Act and that their state-run power authority pays 30% more than would otherwise be the case for liquified natural gas.   In other words, there are no free lunches, and what we may do to protect in one sphere results in costs on another. In some instances, the Jones Act may make complete sense in terms of military preparedness - but in a time of disaster, wherein an island is trying to dig itself out of a real financial dilemma, I don’t believe it does.   In this instance, I believe it would make sense to extend the Jones Act moratorium to afford the island the lower costs that come with it. If not, we as taxpayers are inevitably forced to pay for more aid for Puerto Rico, and currently these aid packages are not offset - which means they end up being attached to the national debt that you and I will indeed be paying.  Take a listen to the conversation, and you’ll also get a sense of the way in which many people in government worry about their lane of government...and that lane only. This thinking comes to the detriment of all of us in advancing common sense and watching out for our interests as taxpayers.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/videos/731176067092177/",NA,45,23,6,3,0,1,0,0

I just finished an hour and 40 minute telephone town hall meeting with people back home. The conversation largely centered on tax reform and folks’ concerns about what might come next on the bill that’s quickly moving its way through the House.  Three quick thoughts….  One, this is fundamentally a bill about trying to encourage more in the way of American investment. It may or may not be successful toward that end, but that is certainly its intent. It’s for that reason that its benefits are skewed toward the corporate side with about $1 trillion of the $1.5 trillion in cost of the bill attributed to corporate and business tax reduction.   Two, the part of the bill dealing with individual returns attempts to strike the balance between rewarding those who pay into the system and the larger quotient of equity. The problem here is: equity in whose eyes? Some would say it’s fair to have most of the tax cuts in the individual category go to people of more modest means. Others would say: that’s not fair, because disproportionately folks at the upper end of the tax scale pay much more in income tax. To give you a sense of reference here, the bottom 50% of earners pay 2.83% out of the federal income tax load. The top 10% of earners pay 70% of the income tax load. In this case, the top 10% are those making more than $133,000...which means husband and wife making a little over $60,000 each would find themselves in the top 10% that pay that 70% of the tax load. Getting this equation right is something that will be debated further in the House and most certainly in the Senate.  Finally, one of the other things that did come up in the conference call was concern about the bill’s cost and its impact on our nation’s debt. I too am struggling with this. The back and forth on this component of the debate I thought was very well described in Marty Feldstein’s piece on Monday in The Wall Street Journal. If you haven’t taken a look, I’d ask you to do so, but in short form he lays out the trade-off between the growth in annual income that might come with tax change versus the added cost to the national debt.  Take a look, and I’d be curious to get your thoughts….","link","https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporate-tax-reform-is-the-key-to-growth-1509907471","wsj.com",100,137,15,1,1,2,4,21

His simple point was that by its very nature, our government was not designed for efficiency.   Each of the checks and balances that the Founding Fathers installed to prevent the centralization of power, and the absolute power that comes with it, creates inefficiencies. You have this construct combined with human nature and the more casual observance that many people have on things that they don’t own or control versus the things that they do. There are a lot of truths represented in what Friedman was getting at.  This brings me to H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, a bill that passed the House last Wednesday by a vote of 232 to 188. I voted no and wanted to touch on two of my concerns….   One, it makes our federal budget hole bigger - not smaller. At one level, the bill represented a step forward for the Forest Service itself. But when you and I think about our federal tax bill, we don’t just look at the Forest Service budget, we look at the whole bill. We don’t care if you add to the left pocket, if you’re taking an equal amount out of the right pocket. This was the case with this bill. In the bill, the president would be able to declare a wildfire as a national emergency and direct FEMA to give emergency money to the affected areas of the country. This again represented a win for the Forest Service and put it on equal footing in the way that we treat hurricanes and other natural disasters.   The problem here lies in the funding component of what would take place. FEMA’s emergency fund has been running perpetually dry. Just last month, Congress voted twice to provide supplemental appropriations to disaster-struck areas to the tune of $26.1 billion because the fund was out of money. So, a remedy that doesn’t address the larger funding riddle of adding to the one pocket while then concurrently needing to take out of the other pocket is hardly a remedy that helps the taxpayer.   To be clear, fires ultimately should be treated as other natural disasters. But we have to come up with some sort of remedy that addresses the larger funding problem, and this bill did not do that.  The other problem with this bill was that it totally ignored the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011’s limits on discretionary spending. Simply put, this means that Congress would be handing over a blank check for fire-fighting activities on federal lands. Under current law, there is a limit on disaster spending, which is based on the average funding provided for disaster relief over the last ten years. The bill here would ask for a recalculation of that number to include wildfire spending, which would end up increasing overall spending by a completely unknown amount. Blank checks don’t work.","status",NA,NA,53,52,11,1,3,1,4,1

To be clear, the Senate has already laid out its marker in substantially reducing some of the reforms that were in the House bill. I have highlighted some of the major ones below.   As to the so-called “Manager’s Amendment”...this represents the latest changes in the House version. There was an original bill in the House which was updated earlier this week by the Committee. Before final passage by the Committee today, there was a second Manager’s Amendment, and I thought worthwhile sharing here some of bigger changes in the bill as well in the section below that follows a comparison between House and Senate bills.   2nd MANAGER'S AMENDMENT to the House bill:   Pass-Through Rates:  The amendment provides a 9% tax rate, in lieu of the ordinary 12% individual tax rate, for the first $75,000 in net business taxable income of an active owner or shareholder earning less than $150,000. As taxable income exceeds $150,000, the benefit of the 9% rate relative to the 12% rate is reduced, and it is fully phased out at $225,000.  Businesses of all types are eligible for the 9% rate up to the $75,000. The 9% rate is phased in over five years, such that the rate for 2018 and 2019 is 11%, the rate for 2020 and 2021 is 10 percent, and the rate for 2022 and thereafter is 9 percent.  For single filers, the $75,000 and $150,000 amounts are $37,500 and $75,000, and for heads of household, those amounts are $56,250 and $112,500.  The amendment also maintains current law treatment of payroll taxes for pass-through income, which applies only to labor income earned from a pass-through business and not on capital income.  Adoption expenses:  The amendment preserves the $5,000 non-refundable adoption tax credit  Child Tax Credit:   Requires submission of a full Social Security Number for each child in order to receive the full credit  Moving expenses for military:  The amendment preserves tax deductibility of moving expenses for active duty members of the armed forces who must relocate pursuant to an order  Deduction for Corporate Dividends:  Amendment preserves current law effective tax rates on income from dividends received of 65% and 50%  Business Interest Deduction:  Provides exclusion from limitation of net interest deductibility in underlying bill (capped at 30% of income) for taxpayers that paid or accrued interest on “floor plan financing indebtedness”  Full expensing would not be allowed for any trade or business with floor plan financing indebtedness  R&D Expenditure Amortization:  Amendment requires certain research and development costs to be amortized over a five-year period, or over a 15-year period in the case of research and development outside of the United States.   Deductibility of Contingent-Fee Litigation Expenses:  The amendment disallows an immediate deduction for litigation costs advanced by an attorney to a client in contingent-fee litigation until the contingency is resolved, thus creating parity throughout the United States as to when, if ever, such expenses are deductible in such litigation.  Under current law, certain attorneys within the Ninth Circuit who work on a contingency basis can immediately deduct expenses that ordinarily would be considered fees paid on behalf of clients, in the form of loans to those clients, and therefore not deductible when paid or incurred.  Deferred Foreign Income:  Increases effective tax rate on deemed repatriated foreign earnings, from 5% to 7% for illiquid assets and from 12% to 14% for liquid assets.  Mini-BAT:  Eliminates markup on deemed expenses… I see this as a big deal because what the Committee had previously contemplated was the completion of a new nexus in government’s ability to tax that could have been changed with just a couple of words by future Congress that might be more left in its leanings.   Expands the foreign tax credit to apply to 80% of foreign taxes and refines measurement of foreign taxes by reference to Section 906 of current law, as opposed to a formula based on accounting information  Excise Tax on Investment Income of Private Colleges and Universities:  The amendment ensures that endowment assets of a private university that are formally held by organizations related to the university, and not merely those that are directly held by the university, are subject to the 1.4-percent excise tax on net investment income.  Political Statements in Churches:  Ensures that engagement in certain political speech does not disqualify a 501(c)(3) organization from non-profit status if that speech was made in the ordinary course of the organization’s business  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-09/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-senate-gop-tax-proposal","link","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-09/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-senate-gop-tax-proposal","bloomberg.com",21,49,19,0,2,1,2,17

As you may know, I voted about a year ago to advance Jim Jordan’s resolution to force the IRS commissioner, John Koskinen, to resign. We were not successful in that endeavor, and the president decided not to force the issue as he came into office - but the president did decide not to renew Koskinen’s appointment.   It ends today, and as a consequence, John Koskinen’s term has finally come to an end.  As you may remember, it was under his watch that the IRS began targeting conservative groups for extra scrutiny in March of 2010. The applications of organizations for tax-exempt status with the words “Tea Party” or “Patriots” in their names were placed on hold for the next two years. During the same period, the agency approved around two dozen more liberal-leaning groups’ applications. The overall effect of these actions was to arguably create a partisan advantage in the 2012 election.  After the targeting of conservatives came to light, Lois Lerner, the head of the unit responsible, took the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify in her own defense. Under a subpoena, and legally required to produce all documents, the IRS deleted as many as 24,000 of Lois Lerner’s emails. With the full knowledge that the emails had been deleted, Commissioner Koskinen lied under oath to Congress when he said, “since the start of the investigation, every email has been preserved. Nothing has been lost. Nothing has been destroyed.”  I get it that people from both sides of the political divide will have different stories of frustration or want with regard to what people in office have done under oath...but I think the video below lays out a pretty compelling case of why all of us should have found Koskinen’s actions concerning...again, regardless of which side of the political divide we may stand on. Because indeed we can’t function as a republic when left of center administrations will target right of center advocacy groups...and vice versa.   In any case, the video laying out Jordan’s case is below, and I’d be curious to hear your thoughts on this issue...or I suspect others that fit into this same category…","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/videos/733680136841770/",NA,78,60,19,3,2,0,0,6

I voted yes.  This bill was the conference report, which is the negotiated version between the House and Senate bills.  From a funding standpoint, it essentially stayed the same with a topline figure of $700 billion, which would authorize $634.2 billion for national security activities and $66 billion for war operations, called the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) fund. This was about $3 billion more than what was requested in the House version.  I’ve long and repeatedly expressed my concerns with regard to the NDAA on the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF), OCO’s use in normal operations, and the significance of the budget caps. Those concerns seem as if they will be perpetual; therefore, the most notable changes were as follows:  The bill withdrew the creation of the new Space Corps in the Department of Defense.   It made improvement on my concerns with regard to OCO. War funding accounts have been used as something of a slush fund to cover normal operations. This bill tightened up the budget categories in defense so that war funding would be for war funding and normal operations would be for normal operations.  This bill included a modified version of Congressman Tom Cole’s provision that would require the president to send Congress a report and plan for defeating terrorists in the Middle East. This provision was built around my concern on the Authorization of Force question. For too long, presidents have been able to act unilaterally with amazingly little oversight from Congress in getting us into foreign conflicts. Without an update to the current AUMF, we have continued operations in the Middle East for the last 16 years.  I think that each of these three more major changes was an improvement to where the House bill ended and, accordingly, supported the conference report. For further detail on my thinking of the House bill, I’ve included my Facebook post from July of this year below:","link","https://www.facebook.com/RepSanfordSC/posts/687506038125847","facebook.com",17,11,0,0,0,1,0,4

It passed by a vote of 227 to 205, and with mixed feelings, I voted yes. In some measure, I did so as a vote to continue the process because many Republicans from Northeastern states want to keep the tax exemptions currently favorable to high tax states - and for the process to continue, my vote was needed. At another level, I did so because I believe I was elected to limit the size and scope of government - and limiting taxes and spending are close proxies in efforts to do so.    It was indeed because I believe in limited government that I voted no on the budget a few weeks ago. This year’s budget proposed increased spending over the next year...and the 10 years contemplated in the budget itself. And that's hardly a formula for limited government and the individual freedom that comes with it.    So, the yes vote allows the process to continue and is consistent with the fact that I have always voted to reduce taxes when given the choice. It’s my hope that the Senate measure - and the Conference report that will follow - refines and improves this bill passed today. I will make a decision on that Conference report as it comes our way, likely in December.   The bill is a mixed bag, and it’s for that reason groups like the Realtors, Homebuilders, and others back home have come out against it. But even with its detractors, I believe the bill does more good than bad and for this reason voted to support it.    Let me list the things I liked and those I did not.   On the positive side, the bill represents a step forward in American competitiveness.    The bill has been described as comprehensive reform. It is not that. Fundamentally, it is a corporate tax cut and reform bill. Indeed, of the $1.5 trillion in anticipated cost, in broad strokes, $1 trillion of the benefit accrues to the corporate side while about $300 billion goes to individual tax reduction and the last $200 billion goes to estate tax reduction.   One can argue for or against this distribution of tax benefit, but from the standpoint of raw competitiveness of the American society versus others around the world, this bill moves us toward being more competitive. Over the last ten years, industrialized countries have moved their rates down to the point that America’s marginal corporate tax rate is the highest in the world. Ireland has moved theirs to 12.5%, while Canada has moved its to 15%, and both have seen substantial capital inflows as a consequence. The industrialized average on corporate tax rates is now 23%, and this bill moves us from 35% to 20%. Lowering corporate rates is in fact a bipartisan idea. Senator Ron Wyden, a democrat from Oregon, has proposed doing this for the last seven years.    It would also move us from a global corporate tax system to a territorial one, which aligns with the way that most other countries tax corporate earnings. Our not addressing these two things has driven companies like Johnson Controls, Burger King, and a long list of other long-time American companies to move their corporate headquarters overseas. This bill attempts to rectify this and is the main selling point of my reading of the bill. It certainly does other things like full expensing at the corporate level, but at the end of the day, these are features rather than the main benefits of what this bill offers.   On the individual side, the bill eliminates things like the Alternative Minimum Tax while attempting to broaden the tax base by eliminating exemptions and deductions that allow the House bill to move us from 7 tax brackets down to 4. All this is done under the name of tax simplification. But when you really begin to get into the details of things like small business pass-through income requirements, you’re struck by the fact that if this is simplification, then I would hate to see complication.    In the same vein, the bill’s efforts to eliminate the estate tax are mixed. The bill doubles the estate tax exemption for the next six years, and I think a doubling of this exemption is good and reasonable. On the other hand, the bill then eliminates the estate tax in 2025. What this means in plain English is that the bill raises the estate tax exemption. Period. And not more than that.    Given that no Congress can bind another Congress, I would find it hard to believe that a future Congress would somehow muster the political courage to say that Jeff Bezos ought to be able to hand off his $94 billion estate tax-free to his kids and grandkids - when this Congress won’t. In short, certain sections of the code like this were gamed rather than really dealt with. In some cases, this was for political purposes; in other cases, it was to affect the scoring cost of the bill itself.    But the long and short of this is that the bill has features in it that would appeal to an array of taxpayers and indeed proposes some form of tax cut for eighty percent of the tax filers.   On the negative side:   One, I don’t like what this bill does to the deficit. To be clear, you can’t have a tax cut and have revenue neutrality. And if you really believe that government should be smaller, then cutting both spending and taxes are essential. The catch here is that Congress oftentimes has voted for one but not the other, but I can only control the one vote that I have been vested with by people at home. And I’ve consistently voted to do both.   Many people in the debate that has occurred have been 100% disingenuous on this point, as they have found newfound religion on the importance of avoiding deficits. Some of these folks in fact have been some of the biggest spenders in Congress - and how they now make their argument as they do is just a touch curious...but politics are politics.   Here is the conundrum on this point. If we do nothing, our debt-to-GDP numbers are projected to continue to rise dramatically over the next ten years from 77% today to 91%. It was 35% as recently as 2007. With this tax bill, it would rise another 5% to 96%. In short, we are in real trouble either way if we have not done something material to cut spending and to increase economic growth. The bet on this bill is that it will help with the latter. It is not a guarantee but an educated bet. More optimistically, some point to the fact that tax extenders, which would largely go away with any tax reform measure, account for $450 billion in cost of the bill. When combined with the one trillion in economic growth groups like the Tax Foundation believe would come with this bill, they believe we can get much closer to parity in the bill's effective cost over the next ten years.     My reasoning goes with the first argument rather than the second, as I was taught a long time ago in business to focus on downside rather than upside in looking at budget forecasts.   One last point here on the relative weight of taxes versus spending going forward in solving our deficit problem - and it reinforces how important cutting spending will be. On average, the federal government has brought in about 18% of GDP in taxes. This has been remarkably consistent - regardless of tax rates. Sometimes high rates, other times low rates...but always about the same take to government. In short, you can only squeeze but so much juice from a lemon. On the other hand, spending has risen steadily during those same years. Today, we are at about 20.7%. It takes no mathematician to recognize that if you take in 18 but spend 20, you have a problem. What this tax bill would do is to leave us within 1% of our historic norm on taxes. Meanwhile, spending is projected to rise to 23.4% over the same ten years….about 3.5% above what we have been doing.     Two, it takes people off the tax rolls. I know this has been sold as a feature of the bill, but I think it’s a mistake. I believe that there is a value to people looking at their tax return at the end of the year and asking whether or not they got their money’s worth. There is a value to having all Americans with skin in the deal on whether or not their government is working. We’re getting dangerously close to a tipping point in our society wherein more people get from government than give to government. And what we do by taking more people off the rolls is to give them reason to be unlimited in their demands for government since they’re not tangibly paying part of the freight of the cost of the government from which they benefit.    Three, while giving to corporations a windfall with things like full expensing, which from a scoring standpoint is very costly, the bill actually raises the tax load on some individuals. This seems a bit crazy to me. I don’t like some rich folks any more than the next guy, but it needs to be recognized that we have a progressive tax system, and as you go up the income tax scale, you pay more. In fact, the top 10% of earners in America pay 70% of the income taxes in our country.    Many of these folks in this group aren’t exactly rich since the top 10% in America begins at a family income of $133,000. That means a school teacher married to a truck driver could find themselves indeed in the top 10%. What Republicans have done here is to continue down this line of class warfare that I think is counterproductive. The bill does deliver tax relief to about 80% of those who have filed (and this has been noted by even the Washington Post), but the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the bill will mean a tax increase for 8.3% of taxpayers in 2019 and 22% of taxpayers by 2025. This is flawed. If we’re going to go down this route of alleged tax reform, then it would seem reasonable to me that all people would get some degree of tax relief as opposed to government penalizing some who are very productive in our society.    Four, while the bill does eliminate some exemptions while reducing the number of tax brackets, this is hardly the simplification that you would see in a Fair Tax or Flat Tax proposal. I think the worst of these areas is with small business treatment wherein there is a very complicated 70-30 split on income. I’ve heard from many people at home concerned about the way in which the formula would work - because it could advantage the investor in a small business over the owner/operator. This part of the bill needs much more work.   I have a host of other thoughts, but I know my analysis is getting long in the tooth. Accordingly, I will call it quits. But I want to leave you with this. I am committed to votes that will improve the lives of people along the coast of South Carolina and across the country at large. After one includes everything from advancing the process to how to close part of our budget deficit with growth, I believe the bill narrowly comes up with more positive than negative in improving the lives of those I represent. There is still more work to be done on this bill, and for this reason, I will be working where I can to improve it. No Representative has complete control over a bill like this, but I was part of a group that pushed very hard against the idea of a border adjustment tax as this bill was getting rolled out - and our collective voice was instrumental in eliminating that provision of the bill. I will look for more opportunities to further refine this bill.   More than anything, I would love to get your thoughts on this tax proposal and what should come next in the Senate and Conference reports.","status",NA,NA,203,278,46,7,0,4,18,129

So run your race so as to obtain the prize.”   What’s interesting about that Bible verse is that it applies to a whole lot more than running races...it’s an admonition on life. What’s further interesting is that it applies not just to any of us individually but as well to all of us collectively.   Which brings me around to yesterday’s vote on tax reform. Part of what tipped the scales from my end was the degree to which we have to both cut spending and grow the economy to have any chance of getting out of the mathematical pickle we’re working ourselves into as a country.  In this regard, the Tax Foundation recently released their annual International Tax Competitive Index that ranks the 35 so-called developed countries according to their tax code on the aspects of competitiveness and neutrality. A competitive and neutral tax code is one that accomplishes three things: promotes economic growth, encourages investment over savings, and raises enough money to fund the government programs that exist.   This year, for the second year in a row, the United States came in at number 30 overall. Think about that...out of the 35 so-called developed nations, the United States ranks almost dead last.

In short form, it expresses the sense of Congress in regards to our strategy in Yemen. The measure passed, but I was one of 30 who voted against the bill, and here’s why:  In life, we are measured by what we do rather than what we say.  This bill said - in a long list of “whereas” clauses - the right thing with regard to our military being subject to the Authorization of the Use of Military Force in operations in Yemen. That’s what it said. But again, actions speak louder than words.  So while it suggested we should hold ourselves to an Authorization for the Use of Military Force by Congress, what was in fact acknowledged in the debate was that the Pentagon has been sharing targeting information and refueling planes that Saudi Arabia and other allies are using to attack Houthi rebels in their proxy war in Yemen with Iran.  The latest estimates show that we have spent over $5 trillion on operations in the Middle East. Most of these operations have occurred without an Authorization for the Use of Military Force agreement. I have spoken up many times on the importance of our doing so because the Founding Fathers were deliberate in investing in the Congress alone the responsibility of the authorization of force. They knew that body bags came back to districts across this country - not to Washington. Yet we keep on operating, and administration after administration seems to double down in their belief that they can act without Congress’ direct approval.   Congress quietly objects but funds whatever the administrations decide to do in operations...and the charade goes on with great cost to the taxpayer and in loss of life and limb to American soldiers.  It is legitimate to say that we think we have a vital interest in that part of the world and need to fund continued operations. But that debate needs to take place in earnest, and what we saw in this resolution was yet another backdoor attempt by Congress to say that we don’t approve...but the actions of the United States won’t really change.  I have watched portions of Ken Burns’ special on PBS with regard to the Vietnam War and the 55,000 American lives that were lost in that conflict. In every instance, the soldier did their part. They did more than their part as many never came home.  I think that we need to have a much more robust debate on authorizing force in the Middle East, and the idea that a non-binding resolution represents that debate to me is wanting...particularly since actions speak louder than words.","status",NA,NA,30,38,3,3,0,1,2,3

Thanksgiving really is my favorite holiday...ours is a frenetic one with lots of outdoors, hunting, and more down at the farm. In whatever your tradition might be, I do hope that you were with family, friends, and loved ones….  Under the category of catching up with vote descriptions that came before Thanksgiving, let me reference the vote we took earlier in November on the CHIP program. Technically, it’s called the  State Children’s Health Insurance Program, and it expired in September, which brought the vote up in November.  It passed 242 to 174, and I voted for it because it represented a number of forward steps in dealing with entitlement funding. These were small steps...but important. I’m most critical of the way in which many funding decisions are made in Washington, but this bill represented the kinds of action we ought to see more of up here.  It did three things that we’re going to have to do with entitlement spending going forward. One, the bill was paid for...precious little is these days. Two, it included a small degree of means testing that just makes common sense on an entitlement program that is mostly paid for by the taxpayer. Finally, it curbed the federal commitment on what had become an open-ended commitment to states.  To get our arms around entitlement spending, we’re going to have to do a lot more of each of those things to get our budget back in balance. But let me explain in a little bit more detail the program and what made sense on each of these three steps that the bill took on these fronts.  First, what is CHIP? It’s a joint federal-state program that provides health insurance for children in families that do not qualify for Medicaid. While it is an entitlement program, it is different from Social Security and Medicare because its funding is not automatic. This means that Congress must authorize new funding for it to continue. Indeed, this bill extended CHIP funding for five years and was fully paid for.  The particular ways in which bills are paid for are called “offsets.” In this case, four of the offsets made permanent changes in law that will allow savings to gather beyond the ten-year budget window. Another offset that I viewed as important made cuts to the Affordable Care Act’s Prevention and Public Health Fund. That fund has essentially been a $2 billion slush fund for the Department of Health and Human Services to spend on whatever it wants without oversight from Congress. Some $12.5 billion was earmarked for it over ten years and has been spent on things like massage therapy, funding for groups that want higher taxes on tobacco and soda, and zoning laws against fast-food restaurants. Even if one thinks these are worthy of taxpayer support, at the very least they should be cleared by Congress. This bill cut that fund over eight years and then completely zeros it out. There is a simple principle here: the Constitution authorizes only Congress to authorize spending. The closure of this particular portion of CHIP funding was important and even outside of the confines of the three things I thought most vital about the bill.  The means testing came in two ways.   One, it would, for the first time, change eligibility requirements so that states can remove jackpot lottery winners from their Medicaid rolls.   Is this not insane? A study of just Michigan lottery winners alone found that there were 3,500 lottery winners last year alone who were receiving welfare, food stamps, or other aid. In fact, back in 2012, Governor Rick Schneider signed a measure trying to curb at least a part of this when two people were found using food stamps despite winning $700,000 and $850,000 lump sum prizes. Is that crazy or what? You win almost a million dollars, but you’re still able to draw down federal funds? This is what drives people crazy about government. What the study showed in Michigan was duplicated in nearly every other state in this country.  The other part of means testing came to earners over $500,000. This is not a big group, but it would require them to pay a greater share of the premiums for Part B and D. It’s currently 80 percent and would move to 100 percent of their premiums. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated the change would save $5.8 billion over ten years.  Finally, some states had 100 percent of their CHIP programs funded by the federal government -  no matter how generous their programs were. This raised at least two problems: one, how much do you care about something that’s paid for 100 percent by someone else? This was the case between many states and the federal government. It also means that states that tried to be more judicious in the way that they spent CHIP money in essence were subsidizing states that weren’t.    New York is a good example. It had high income eligibility levels (a family of four with $99,000 /year qualified) and a 100 percent federal match rate. That meant that taxpayers were footing the entire bill for New York’s generous CHIP program. The bill improved this situation by limiting eligibility to lower-income levels and reducing the federal match rate back to the historical levels of 70 percent.        Again, these weren’t big steps, but they were important for what they hopefully could point to as it relates to entitlement funding at the federal level. This bill will now come back to the House probably next week in a conference report. If it stays true to these larger precepts, I’ll again vote for it...and if it doesn’t, I won’t.

I have included a comparison that breaks out the differences between the current House and Senate bills, and I would ask that you take a look. This is getting to the point of important, given its hypothetical impact in your life. Many bills don’t matter because they never make it across the finish line and to the president’s desk for signature...this one will.   In fact, with the Senate passing their version of the tax bill early Saturday morning, the House voted Monday evening to continue the process of getting to a tax bill that can be passed into law. The vote passed 222 to 192, and I voted yes.   The next step is a merging of the House and Senate bills for a final tax bill. In some cases, they may take the House version; in other cases, they may take the Senate version. In still other cases, they may come up with something entirely different...though that happens much less than a pick between House and Senate versions.

You may have noticed that there’s now talk about the corporate tax cut going to 22% instead of 20%. In my view, this would be a mistake...but it’s probably the direction things are headed. It was the Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman who noted years ago that the best way to affect economic activity came by lowering marginal rates. Not only does it give worker and investor alike added inducement to indeed work and invest, it gets government out of the business of social engineering and picking winners and losers in the commercial marketplace.   The reason there is such a strong lobbying community in and around Washington is in large measure tied to the tax code. Seemingly small exemptions and carve-outs can mean millions of dollars in windfall. The ability to pick winners and losers here gives people in politics more power than they should have and sets in motion a lot of the very dynamics that people detest about Washington and its operations.  So, if you want to take power and authority out of Washington, lower the rate.   But given the tug-of-war that is now taking place between House and Senate versions, and what to leave in and take out, it’s important to remember that for each percentage point that is added back to the corporate rate over 20%, about $100 billion in revenue over 10 years. Eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax costs about $40 billion on the corporate side and about $132 billion on the individual side.Some of the money in question is about this. Another debate point is on the deductibility of interest cost with business. Still another is on the deductibility of state and local taxes at the individual level...and so forth….  The tug-of-war is just beginning and will certainly go through next week...and maybe into the week following.

On the one hand, I would argue the Second Amendment is the teeth behind every other right promised to us in the Bill of Rights. It’s something that I and many others feel strongly about when we talk about freedom and its sustainability. On the other hand, crazy people have been doing a lot of crazy things with guns of late, and it sickens all of us to see the way that guns are used in this instance.  That’s one thought.  The other thought is that everyone talks about finding common ground and compromise and getting things done in Washington...but you know what happens oftentimes when these things are done? It seems that everyone ends up frustrated.  Such, it seems to me, is the case with H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017, which was combined with H.R. 4477, the Fix NICS Act of 2017, a bill to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).  In defining this in political terms, many on the left have long wanted better control of who gets a gun, so that crazy people - or many other categories of people who are currently not allowed to purchase a gun - don’t end up with one. H.R. 4477 attempts to do this.   From the right, people have long believed that the Second Amendment doesn’t stop at a state border. That if one has gone through the licensing requirements necessary for a concealed permit, they should not be made an outlaw in simply driving their vehicle across the state line.  This package that we voted on Wednesday combined these two concepts and, in essence, had something in the bill for both sides...which means there was something to dislike from both sides. I thought that there was more good than bad in the package and, accordingly, voted yes as this measure passed 231 to 198.  On one side, H.R. 4477 expands the overall process in which state and federal agencies report individuals into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Currently, when you go to buy a gun from a registered dealer, they must run your information through the national database, which subjects you to being processed by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Gun purchases and ownership are not allowed to those under indictment or those convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term of more than one year. Similarly, this moratorium extends to fugitives from justice, unlawful users of controlled substances, persons who have been adjudicated as a mental-defective, or those committed to a mental institution. The list goes on to include illegal aliens in the United States, those with a dishonorable discharge from the military, or those subject to a restraining order.   The purpose of the Fix NICS bill is to incentivize and/or punish agencies for reporting or not reporting proper information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with precision and timeliness. Under the bill, states and agencies will receive financial incentives or federal grant preferences if they comply with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System requirements.  The other half of this bill, H.R. 38, covered concealed carry, and I was actually an original cosponsor of this bill. If a state doesn’t allow a person to conceal carry, then the reciprocity is not valid. Currently, 42 states already allow citizens with clean backgrounds to carry concealed firearms.  My sense is that the Senate will not move forward on the concealed carry component of this bill, but given all that’s swirling around with the tax bill and more, I’m not sure. Should the bill come back to the House, I’ll make a determination based on the degree to which I think it stays true to the Second Amendment and common sense reforms to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.  In fairness, there have been inaccuracies and inefficiencies in the existing NICS system. This is highlighted by the fact that just last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation attempted to rescind 4,170 purchases based on the fact that 4,170 ineligible purchasers have been able to purchase guns. The bottomline is what I indicated earlier, which is that I believe that balance in the debate needs to be maintained...and I would define that in large measure based on the degree to which this bill moving forward continues to hold true to the promises of the Second Amendment.","status",NA,NA,47,73,10,4,2,0,1,12

Over the past ten years, the Palestinian government has received more than $4 billion in American assistance...in spite of the fact that the Palestinian Authority devotes about 8% of its budget to supporting the families of Palestinian terrorists, including those killed during attacks and those in prison.   I don’t think I’m old fashioned in saying that this sort of indirect American aid is not exactly the will of taxpayers that I talk to along the coast of South Carolina. It’s another of those things that makes one scratch one’s head in saying how can this be. We send aid that is then used to pay for the families of terrorists?  We took an important vote toward common sense on Tuesday night in the form of H.R. 1164.  The bill was actually called the Taylor Force Act, named after a 28 year old, former U.S. Army officer named Taylor Force who was killed in March 2016 by a Palestinian terrorist who attacked a group of tourists in Tel Aviv. In the presence of his family, the House passed the bill.  This is quite similar to a bill I introduced earlier this year with Congressman Ted Budd called the No Bonuses for Terrorists Act. This bill would cut off American aid to the Palestinian government until the Secretary of State has certified that the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Liberation Organization have stopped paying benefits to the families of terrorists that aren’t available to the Palestinian population at large.  In Taylor Force’s case, the attacker, who was killed by police, was praised in Palestinian Authority media, and his family was awarded a generous monthly stipend. This is a part of a broad program in Palestinian law that encourages Palestinians to attack Israelis and other citizens and offers a sliding scale of benefits for the attacker and their families. In essence, the bigger the attack, the bigger the monetary reward.   Specifically, H.R. 1164 would limit foreign aid to the West Bank and Gaza until the State Department certifies the Palestinian Authority (PA) has taken two, concrete steps. First, it must end acts of violence against U.S. and Israeli citizens by individuals under its jurisdiction. Second, it must terminate any and all payments to any individual who has committed an act of violence or their families.   Again, this bill ultimately was not about Israel or Palestine...or any of the other actors in that region. Instead, I believe it was about common sense and guarding against the at-times nonsensical ways that American taxpayer money is used and abused.","status",NA,NA,270,171,143,6,0,22,7,82

In that realm, can I circle back around to an interesting recent vote on a bill that renews two copper-nickel mining leases on national forest land in Minnesota. In this case, the leases are held by a Chilean-owned mining company, and I think disturbingly what would be done for them would fundamentally alter the federal government’s ability to issue mineral rights leases and enforce environmental laws and regulations in Minnesota going forward.  Let me expand a little more.  I’ve long believed that conservatism should apply to more than just financial resources. Teddy Roosevelt’s belief is one that I share, and I think is shared by many people along the coast of South Carolina...that conservatism should as well apply to natural resources and being conservative with them.  In this regard, what was at play was my grandmother’s notion of moderation in all things. This bill failed on both of these fronts and, I think, was found wanting. For that reason, I voted against H.R. 3905, the Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest Act, which still passed the House 216 to204.   It did three things that are harmful beyond the general concepts that I just described above.  One, it would prevent the Department of the Interior from withholding any federal land in northern Minnesota from use for mining activities going forward, unless specifically authorized by Congress. This seems to me to be hardly a moderate or reasoned approach. Instead, it’s something of a broad brush that would open all lands up that way for mining...when in fact there are a host of competing interests that you and I as taxpayers hold on those federal lands.   For instance, an economic analysis by Key-Log Economics LLC shows that sulfide-ore mining on Superior National Forest lands in the watershed of the Boundary Waters could lead to the loss of nearly 5,000 jobs in tourism, 5,000 to 22,000 jobs in the rest of the economy, a $1.6 billion loss in annual income, and a $500 million reduction in private property values. On the other hand, Twin Metals Minnesota expects its renewed mining operation to bring 650 direct jobs and 1,300 indirect jobs to northeastern Minnesota. The economic math here just doesn’t add up to this being in the better interest of Minnesotans. This is not to say that either interest is better than the other...just that both should be included on a case-by-case basis in evaluating how to use these federal lands. This bill did not do that and in fact as an operating reality eliminated these dual considerations.   What’s important to consider in this bill’s impact is the fact that this is the Boundary Waters Canoe Area. Back when I was a boy scout, our troop took a trip to the Boundary Waters. It’s considered to be a pristine part of our country. This bill would reinstate two leases for copper-nickel mining in Minnesota’s Superior National Forest held by Twin Metals Minnesota LLC, which is owned by Chile-based Antofagasta Plc. In 2016, the Bureau of Land Management denied a request from Twin Metals to renew the leases, citing concerns over the potential harm being done to land in and around the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.   Two, it would prohibit establishing new national monuments, or expanding existing ones, within United States Forest Service lands in Minnesota, again unless specifically authorized by Congress. This provision actually made sense because I think the Antiquities Act has been overused by the executive branch as a way of going around the Congress. The problem here is that the bill only applied it to Minnesota. If we’re going to change the Antiquities Act, I think we should do it nationwide as opposed to for one state.  Three, the bill would require that all new and existing mining leases on United States Forest Service land in Minnesota be “indeterminate preference right leases,” which last until every bit of mineral has been mined from the land in question and are automatically renewed unless the mining company breeches contract. This prevents Congress and the administration from doing what they’re supposed to do in oversight. Both entities have a responsibility to look under the hood and determine whether or not we want to keep going with what we’ve got going. Instead, this bill puts in place a perpetual mining rights lease...which looks, smells, and feels like a sweetheart deal because that is not the way in which natural resource extraction contracts are handled on federal lands.  It’s for these reasons that the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service began a joint, two-year study in January to assess the environmental impact of continued copper-nickel mining, which produces as a byproduct highly toxic sulfide-ore, in the Boundary Waters Wilderness. All mining operations in the area would be temporarily halted while the study is completed. Interestingly, the study is supported by 78% of Minnesotans, according to a March letter from Governor Mark Dayton written to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.  Finally, there was one amendment offered to this bill by Rep. Raul Grijalva, which would have required all new and existing mineral rights leases in Minnesota, in addition to becoming “indeterminate preference right leases,” to pay royalty rates of no less than 16.66%. The typical royalty rate paid in the United States on mineral leases for hard rock mining of precious metals is around 5%. Setting such a high floor for royalty rates relative to the rest of the country is unfair for all the reasons I’ve described above. We shouldn’t treat Minnesota greater than any other state...or less than any other state, and this amendment would have done just that. For this reason, I voted against the amendment, which failed, 182 to 237.","status",NA,NA,42,37,6,1,0,2,1,7

The highest individual tax rate will be 37%...down from the current 39.6%.  3. The income deduction rate for pass-through businesses will be lowered to 20%...lower than the 25% proposed by the House and the 23% by the Senate. 4. There will be a cap on the mortgage interest deduction at $750,000, which splits the difference between current law and the House versions...at $1 million and $500,000, respectively.  To give a sense of scale, each percentage point that is added back to the corporate rate over 20% would free up around $100 billion in revenue over the next ten years.

If you would like to watch a livestream of these proceedings, you can use this link: https://www.fcc.gov/general/live.    To state the obvious, this is an issue that has attracted much attention, and my office has gotten a lot of correspondence on this front, as people want to be able to continue to get content and information through the internet as they do now.   In many ways, what is happening now on net neutrality is a reflection of the larger political climate we are now living through in Washington. One administrator adds or subtracts; the next one does the opposite. I think all of this begs the larger question of how we can avoid getting whipsawed on a whole host of issues - and for me, this means legislative clarity on what should come next.  I believe Congress needs to clarify its stand on the internet.   In the absence of legislation from Congress, we simply respond to rules that the FCC sets and promulgates...but their doing so exceeds the agency’s statutory mandate. The FCC is not an independent regulatory entity that can create statute; their job is simply to enforce the law, which in their case is in large measure rooted in the Federal Communications Act of 1934. This Act and the legislative enhancements that have come since then do not give the agency a mandate to impose pricing and content management rules on internet providers. We may want that, we may wish for it, but I think it’s important that we simply adhere to statute. And this makes it vital that Congress update the law so that it reflects the age of the iPhone and Netflix.   I’ve said consistently that the executive branch needs to be trimmed in, and this is true for Democratic and Republican presidents alike. It was in no way the Founding Fathers’ intent that the executive branch could make unilateral decisions in moving us into war, for instance. Their belief was that it was only Congress that could declare war, but these are not the times in which we live. Congress needs to reclaim its authority in being the only branch of government charged with the creation of laws. It is Congress, through the representative process, that hopefully hears from people and is attentive to those voices in creating statute.  So, my concern over the Obama Administration’s change to net neutrality rules is not on the grounds of the debate itself - but rather who should be making that decision. Chairman Pai’s current proposal to reverse a 2015 decision - restoring the old rules over the internet - is consequently something I agree with...again, not based on content but on the grounds of process.  I don’t think this will be the end of the process, however.  This issue will be debated within Congress given its importance to people’s lives. As that debate unfolds, I will certainly be open-minded to all viewpoints.   Philosophically, I’m starting from a strong belief in the markets, and I would simply make this point: competition, relatively light overall regulation, and even the absence of net-neutrality rules have been at least a part of the formula in making the internet the idea and content generating catalyst that it is today. Where that competition stands out as uneven or unfair or disruptive to minority viewpoints, I will be pushing back against it. But I do think that we want to see competitive forces at work as a part of the formula in driving the innovation that we’ve indeed seen in this sector of the American economy.   For a little bit more on this debate, I’m sharing this National Review article, which I think does a good job of discussing the issue.","link","http://www.nationalreview.com/article/453984/net-neutrality-not-needed-not-fccs-job","nationalreview.com",61,152,19,3,0,1,2,73

And getting to the root of the problem is in fact the key to fixing it.  Think about it this way. You or I drive down a lonely stretch of road, and we get a flat tire. We get towed to the local station, and they do a good job of fixing it. We’re appreciative. We’ve been helped. If we simply focus on this part of what’s transpired, we may look at more help or a bigger tow truck or better phone connections between our lonely spot and the filling station as ways of making future service to other travelers better.  But it turns out that the very station we’ve visited has been sprinkling nails in the road. We didn’t know it, but in fact, they were the root cause of the problems we dealt with and might attempt to make better for future travelers.  My long-winded analogy in this case fits with last week’s vote on H.R. 3731, the Secret Service Retention and Recruitment Act of 2017. It authorized overtime pay for secret service agents, and  I voted against it - not because I in any way don’t appreciate the great work done by many Secret Service agents who put their life on the line...but because we weren’t looking at the root cause of why so many of them have been going into overtime pay status. The bill passed 407 to 4, and I was obviously one of the four that voted against it.  Let me explain a little more….   The Presidential Protection Assistance Act of 1976 capped Secret Service protection costs for each of a president’s non-primary homes at $200,000. If the Secret Service was going to exceed the $200,000 cap, Congress had to vote to approve or deny that spending. This was sensible because it created at least a check and balance on Secret Service expenditure. No function in our federal government, however valid, should be without oversight. However, earlier this year, Congress voted to waive the mandatory vote to exceed this cap. As a result, Congress no longer approves or denies additional spending for protection for the president’s secondary homes. It’s on automatic pilot.  This is a problem because the Secret Service has spent over $60 million in overtime pay in presidential protection this year alone.   It was for this reason that when the Department of Homeland Security’s Authorization was voted on two months ago, I attempted to introduce an amendment that would have kept the vote to waive this cap in place. However, I was not allowed to offer my amendment. Some thought it would be viewed as an embarrassment to the president...my view was that it had nothing to do with the president and everything to do with checks and balances in our political system. This president is certainly unlike any that we’ve had in the past, given the number of secondary homes he has relative to past presidents, but this does not change the importance of Congress looking under the hood of how the Secret Service affords him and his family protection. It’s a simple issue - only Congress has the power of the purse. By removing the mandatory vote to approve more funds for secondary homes protection, Congress voluntarily gave away that power.  So, to recap: $60 million one way or another won’t bankrupt our nation, but abandoning the discipline of congressional oversight just might. And that’s, at the end of the day, what this vote was all about.","status",NA,NA,58,46,16,1,0,0,3,3

He believed in this notion of stewardship...in leaving things better than you found them. That same principle was pushed by my dad to me and siblings, just as it was when I was a Boy Scout in the way that we were to break camp and leave the surfaces better than we found them.  Indeed, over 100 years ago, President Roosevelt said, “Of all the questions which can come before this nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great war, there is none which compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us…. Conservation is a great moral issue for it involves the patriotic duty of ensuring the safety and continuance of the nation.”  It’s important that we treat our natural surroundings as though they are an investment in our future...because they are. Accordingly, I recently signed on to a letter to Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan, urging them to prevent consideration of any proposal that would allow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. What it has to do with the tax bill still baffles me, but that’s what it is now attached to as we go into the final rounds of deliberation on the tax bill itself.  It’s for this reason that I joined David Yarnold, the president of the National Audubon Society, in an op-ed published in The Hill on why drilling in the Arctic doesn’t make sense...from both a conservation perspective and from an economic one.  Again, I believe that to be conservative means more than just a focus on being conservative with financial resources. I believe it should extend to natural resources as well, and in that vein, I’d be curious to see your thoughts on the op-ed below.","link","http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/364329-why-drilling-in-the-arctic-doesnt-add-up-well-wreck","thehill.com",96,87,26,17,0,0,4,3

Today’s bill, H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, has been much debated over the airways, and there are many perceptions - and even a few misconceptions - about the bill as well. After much back and forth in my office in reviewing provisions of the bill that I did not like, I ultimately voted yes because I believe that the whole of the bill represents more good than bad for the people that I represent in the First District and the country at large.   In the paragraphs that follow, I will first lay out my general reference points on this bill and then go into a host of its provisions, some of which were helpful in growing America’s economy and capital base and others which are not.  Revenues not Rates  My first reference point is in recognizing revenue is not rate...and rate is not revenue. Let me explain. In tax policy, you may cut rate but still have revenue go up. People tend to conflate the two, believing that a cut in rate ultimately leads to a cut in revenue. This particularly bothered me when I was governor because I remember hearing lots of politicians talking about “cutting taxes.” But when you actually looked at the amount of money coming into government, it wasn’t happening...revenue (government’s take from its citizenry) was actually going up. The tax rate had been cut, but the revenue still coming into government was actually going up.  Such is the case in this bill. Without the tax bill, revenue coming into the federal government will rise from about $3.3 trillion annually to right at $5 trillion over the next 10 years. With the tax bill, it’ll rise to about the same number but get there more slowly in the intervening years - which amounts to the tax cut component of the bill itself. Both of these numbers represent about a 50% increase in revenue to the government as you move from the $3.3 trillion number to about $5 trillion.  Let me try two other bites at this apple.  Over the next 10 years, the federal government is projected to take in $43 trillion from American citizens. With the tax cut, that number will drop to $41.5 trillion - and that $1.5 trillion difference is indeed the cost of the bill. The question we all have to ask ourselves is whether or not you think our federal functions can work at the $41.5 trillion number instead of the $43 trillion number. That’s a 3.5% difference - and most folks I talk to at home believe that government could afford a 3.5% cut so that they as individuals, and the economy at large, could use and invest that money instead.   What has happened in this debate is misleading from both sides. From a Democratic standpoint, you would think that the end of the world was coming to government services as a result of the tax code. From a Republican standpoint, you would think that they’re cutting off the spigot in Washington, and that you and I will be keeping a much larger chunk of the money we earn at home. In fact, we’re talking about a 3.5% difference. That 3.5% difference hardly fits the hyperbole that we’ve heard in this debate.   Here’s one more iteration of this idea.   This bill keeps us about where we’ve been on revenue to the federal government as a percentage of the overall economy, and as you look at these numbers, it reinforces how vital spending restraint will be. In sum, we can certainly reconfigure the existing revenue stream to the federal government so that it produces more in the way of economic effect, but if this number stays constant, which it in essence does with this bill, it again highlights how vital spending restraint will be in what comes next.  On average, the federal government has brought in about 18% of GDP in taxes. This has been remarkably consistent - regardless of tax rates. Sometimes high rates, other times low rates...but always about the same take to government. In short, you can only squeeze but so much juice from a lemon. On the other hand, spending has risen steadily during those same years. Today, we are at about 20.7%. It takes no mathematician to recognize that if you take in 18 but spend 20, you have a problem. What this tax bill would do is to leave us within less than half of 1% of our historic norm on taxes. Meanwhile, spending is projected to rise to 23.4% over the same ten years….about 3.5% above what we have been doing.    It’s with this reasoning that I have always at the end of the day voted for tax cuts. The biggest bill I’ve previously voted for was on July 22nd of 1999 during my first time in Congress. That package was $792 billion over the 10-year window, which in inflation-adjusted terms would equate to a $1.16 trillion tax cut measure. President Clinton ultimately vetoed that bill, but the basics of that debate were the same as they are today: do you or don’t you believe in getting power and authority out of Washington, DC?   I believe I was elected to limit the size and scope of government - and limiting taxes and spending are close proxies in efforts to do so.    It was indeed because I believe in limited government that I voted no on the budget a few weeks ago. This year’s budget proposed increased spending over the next year...and the 10 years contemplated in the budget itself. And that's hardly a formula for limited government and the individual freedom that comes with it.    If you really believe that government should be smaller, then cutting both spending and taxes are essential. The catch here is that Congress oftentimes has voted for one but not the other, but I can only control the one vote that I have been vested with by people at home. And I’ve consistently voted to do both.   Many people in the debate that has occurred have been 100% disingenuous on this point, as they have found newfound religion on the importance of avoiding deficits. Some of these folks in fact have been some of the biggest spenders in Congress - and how they now make their argument as they do is just a touch curious...but politics are politics.  We’re Toast Without Change   Here is the conundrum on this point. If we do nothing, our debt-to-GDP numbers are projected to continue to rise dramatically over the next ten years from 77% today to 91%. It was 35% as recently as 2007. With this tax bill, it would rise another 5% to 96%. In short, we are in real trouble either way, if we have not done something material to cut spending and to increase economic growth. The bet on this bill is that it will help with the latter. It is not a guarantee but an educated bet.   Part of solving our deficit problem rests in moving this beyond the 1.8% growth that is currently forecast for the next 10 years. That’s significantly below the 3.1% growth our economy has averaged since 1950. Without additional growth, it is near impossible to make the budget math of our nation work without draconian cuts to programs that are very important to people. I do not fall in the Pollyanna camp on growth solving all of the costs of this bill. In business, I was taught to look at the downside and recognize that the upside would take care of itself. Where people get into trouble is that they only focus on the upside and do not make proper preparation and accounting for the possibility of the downside.   So, in looking at this, I think that there are two possibilities. First is some measure of growth that would indeed help Americans’ personal income as well as the finances of our government. On this point, various experts and think tanks that have analyzed the bill agree. They disagree on the extent to which this bill will boost economic growth, but all agree that there will be growth. The Tax Foundation has historically done good work and they project this bill will increase economic growth by 2.86% over a decade. The Joint Committee on Taxation predicts increased growth of 0.8%.    The more optimistic view here tries to suggest that the bill is fully paid for. I don’t believe this, but their argument goes as follows: the tax extenders, which would largely go away with any tax reform measure, account for $450 billion in cost of the bill. When one subtracts that from the one trillion in economic growth groups like the Tax Foundation believe would come with this bill, they believe we can get to zero cost on the bill. People like Treasury Secretary Mnuchin have made this argument, and I think it’s way too optimistic. At minimum, they say that there is a cost to moving to a new system of taxes and that whatever cost might remain should simply be recognized as the cost of a new way of doing business with our tax code.  Most Systems Can Occasionally Use An Upgrade  The bill has been described as comprehensive reform. In the House bill, it was certainly not because fundamentally it was a corporate tax cut and reform bill. Indeed, of the $1.5 trillion in anticipated cost, in broad strokes, $1 trillion of the benefit accrued to the corporate side while about $300 billion went to individual tax reduction and the last $200 billion went to estate tax reduction.   After the Senate and Conference changes, the bill is much more balanced. Its benefits were arguably overdone on the corporate side and underdone on the individual side. It’s still skewed that way with businesses receiving slightly over $1 trillion of benefit in the bill while individuals now receive about $700 billion in benefit. The bill was brought down to the $1.5 trillion budget threshold by an increase in revenue on the international side. $300 billion is projected to come into federal coffers as a result of a one-time 15% tax on repatriated funds now held overseas by large corporations. There are about $2.6 trillion held overseas and while the corporations would get an especially attractive tax rate to induce them into bringing the money home, more than $2 trillion of additional capital stock in the U.S. would be a decidedly good thing.   But on my point here...   One can argue for or against the change in distribution of tax benefit, but from the standpoint of raw competitiveness of the American society versus others around the world, this bill moves us toward being more competitive. Over the last ten years, industrialized countries have moved their rates down to the point that America’s marginal corporate tax rate is the highest in the world. Ireland has moved theirs to 12.5%, while Canada has moved its to 15%, and both have seen substantial capital inflows as a consequence. The industrialized average on corporate tax rates is now 23%, and this bill moves us from 35% to 20%. Lowering corporate rates is in fact a bipartisan idea. Senator Ron Wyden, a democrat from Oregon, has proposed doing this for the last seven years in his Bipartisan Tax Fairness and Simplification Act of 2010. Furthermore, President Obama even suggested dropping the corporate rate to 28% as recently as last year.   The bill would also move us from a global corporate tax system to a territorial one, which aligns with the way that most other countries tax corporate earnings. Our not addressing these two things has driven companies like Johnson Controls, Burger King, and a long list of other long-time American companies to move their corporate headquarters overseas. This bill attempts to rectify this and is the main selling point of my reading of the bill. It certainly does other things like full expensing at the corporate level, but at the end of the day, these are features rather than the main benefits of what this bill offers - and I believe a more competitive corporate rate and system are ingredients to American competitiveness. I say this because the wellbeing of a company like Boeing will affect many people at home along the coast of South Carolina.  A Few Specifics on the Pro Side in the Conference Report  It Improved Small Business’ Standing  I believe that the pass-through provisions for small businesses, LLCs, and Sub-S corporations is substantially improved in this bill. The House version had a complicated approach wherein 30% of a business’s income was designated “qualified business income” and taxed at a maximum 25% rate, while the remaining 70% of income was taxed at the full individual income tax rates. The Conference Report instead allows small businesses organized as pass-throughs to deduct up to 20% of their net income. This provision in the final bill is in essence the same as in the Senate bill, except with a lower deduction of 20% as opposed to 23%. It becomes ridiculously complicated after that, given a wages or capital allocation cap in determining the formula by which a final rate is derived, but the net effect that matters is that small business taxes are moved closer to parity with what’s happening on the corporate side.  Modifications to Individual Deductions  The House version repealed or substantially changed a whole host of deductions on which people registered great concern. From the standpoint of raw capital formation, I don’t know that throwing these things back into the tax bill was helpful, but they were certainly viewed as political necessities. This included the child credit, the historic tax credit, student loan interest, out-of-pocket medical expenses, mortgage interest, tuition for graduate students, and more.   The ability to deduct interest on mortgages for primary and secondary homes remains in the final version of the bill, but the cap is lowered from $1 million to $750,000. In the House version, the threshold was lowered even further to $500,000, and the deduction could only be claimed on primary residences. The Senate bill, on the other hand, made no changes to this deduction. It’s not hard to see how the conference got to a number halfway between $1 million and $500,000...but so goes political math.   I think that the House proposed very good policy in its attempt to repeal the deduction for state and local taxes. It is crazy that states that have been measured in the way they pay public employees were forced to subsidize states that had been outrageously generous in spending other people’s money with the pensions they offer. Take, for instance, states from the northeast or places like California that have been ridiculous on this front.    Let me give you a few examples. Stephen Maguin of the Los Angeles County Sanitation District No. 2 retired in 2012 with an annual pension of $345,408. Michael Johnson retired from the County of Soland in 2011 with an annual pension of $390,485. When you read these numbers, they will make your blood boil, and there are thousands upon thousands of examples that will do so. The House attempted to say “if you want to pay more as a state, then you pay it.” This unfortunately was beaten back by both the Senate and Conference Reports, and the compromise ended up at a cap on state and local property taxes of $10,000. It’s not enough to curb these excesses but, from a policy standpoint, was hopefully a meaningful start in this important debate on cross subsidies. Better policy would have been to eliminate the deduction entirely.  Double Estate Tax Threshold  I think that this was a reasonable compromise. It has become dogma that Republicans believe in complete elimination of the estate tax, but as a practical matter, I think that this raising of the deduction is the most that you will ever get. The Conference Report would double the estate exemption from $5.49 million to $10.98 million.  Very few people I know have estates of more than $11 million, and given the fact that the government has to generate revenue somehow, I think that there are advantages to lowering the tax on every one of us as we accumulate wealth and leaving something in place on estates so that we don’t end up with a permanent aristocracy in the United States. I don’t think that most people I talk to believe that it would be reasonable for Jeff Bezos to be able to hand off his $94 billion estate tax-free to his kids and grandkids.  AMT Thresholds Change  Under the category of tax simplification, the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) stands out as a poster child for that which causes many people to hire an accountant in helping them wade through their taxes. The House version eliminated the AMT; unfortunately, the Conference Report does not. But it does raise the threshold for single and joint-filers, and again this is a step in the right direction in curtailing one of the tax code’s most awkward provisions.   A Few Specifics on the CON Side in the Conference Report  All Tax Cuts on the Individual Side are Temporary  Let me say that again. All tax cuts on the individual side end in year 10 of this tax bill. All tax cuts on the corporate side are permanent.   This is bad policy.   As a reality, it won’t work out this way because temporary tax extenders have a way of developing eternal life. There are a whole host of tax extenders in the present tax code that get renewed annually, and that’s what will happen next here. This was simply a way of gaming the system to fit more into this tax bill. This still leaves you with dealing with the effects in year 10 and how you make modifications to taxes, spending, and the code. It’s a disingenuous way of getting around the budget’s limits on the size of the tax bill itself.   Little to No Simplification  While the House bill eliminated three tax brackets and a host of deductions and credits, the final bill does not. If you have any sort of complexity to your tax return, you’re unfortunately still going to need an accountant to help you work through the maze that still exists in the tax code. This bill retains the existing seven brackets, though their thresholds are slightly altered. This bill retains a host of deductions and credits...some of which I mentioned earlier, some of which are horrible policy. as you think about things like football stadiums and the federal taxpayer. This bill hardly represents the simplification that you would see in a Fair Tax or Flat Tax proposal, and I’m a cosponsor of both of those bills.  Fewer People Have Skin in the Deal  This bill takes people off the tax rolls. I know this has been sold as a feature of the bill, but I think it’s a mistake.    I believe that there is a value to people looking at their tax return at the end of the year and asking whether or not they got their money’s worth. There is a value to having all Americans with skin in the deal on whether or not their government is working. We’re getting dangerously close to a tipping point in our society wherein more people get from government than give to government. And what we do by taking more people off the rolls is to give them reason to be unlimited in their demands for government since they’re not tangibly paying part of the freight of the cost of the government from which they benefit.   The Bill Still Raises Taxes on Some   The bill actually raises the tax load on some individuals. This seems a bit crazy to me. I don’t like some rich folks any more than the next guy, but it needs to be recognized that we have a progressive tax system, and as you go up the income tax scale, you pay more. In fact, the top 10% of earners in America pay 70% of the income taxes in our country.    Many of these folks in this group aren’t exactly rich since the top 10% in America begins at a family income of $133,000. That means a school teacher married to a truck driver could find themselves indeed in the top 10%. What Republicans have done here is to continue down this line of class warfare that I think is counterproductive. The bill does deliver tax relief to about 90% of those who have filed (and this has been noted by even the Washington Post), but by the numbers I’ve seen over the weekend, the bill will mean a tax increase for about 10% of the taxpayers. This is flawed. If we’re going to go down this route of alleged tax reform, then it would seem reasonable to me that all people would get some degree of tax relief as opposed to government penalizing some who are very productive in our society.   Full Expensing is Not Real Accounting   The bill includes substantial levels of full expensing, and while generous from an economic standpoint, it’s equally unrealistic from an economic standpoint. If one buys a jet or tractor, they don’t evaporate at the end of the year. They actually have useful lives, and for a tax code to represent the real accounting that should take place in the business, they should be represented over the useful life of the asset. Not doing this is at one level a testimony to the power of lobbying influences in Washington and, at another level, a desire to juice the economy and raise our numbers from the current 1.8% zone that we’ve been living in. This may prove to be a double-edged sword, given our unemployment numbers and the possibility of real inflation being introduced to our economy as a result of efforts to rev the economy through the tax code at a time of near-full employment.  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) Drilling  Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has nothing to do with taxes in Washington, DC. This provision was added to buy Senator Lisa Murkowski’s vote. It’s bad policy because there is no nexus between this tax bill and the Arctic Refuge. It’s these kinds of trades that sour people on their belief in a democratic system, given this add-on did not see the normal deliberation which you would see in subcommittee and full committee hearings.    It’s for this reason that I wrote an op-ed with David Yarnold, the president of the National Audubon Society, and it was published in The Hill and to read the op-ed I’d ask that you click on this link: http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/364329-why-drilling-in-the-arctic-doesnt-add-up-well-wreck.   Could Well Result in Tax Increases   This seems counterintuitive, but let me explain. The national debt represents our nation’s greatest challenge. It will become an issue that dominates the headlines, though it is dormant today and sadly not focused upon by the president or many in Congress these days.   For the reasons already expressed in this piece, the bulk of addressing that debt challenge will come in cutting expenses, but it’s vital that we look at every angle toward addressing this issue and that indeed includes the stability of our revenue stream to the federal government. While this bill won’t add the $1.5 trillion that has been so widely reported...present tax extenders are about $450 billion of the bill’s cost, and while there is going to be some measure of economic growth that comes with this package, my concern here is where we are in the economic cycle. We’re now in the third-longest economic recovery in American history. We are due for a slowdown. When that happens, our revenues will slow, and my concern is that people will point to the tax cut as the reason for the deficits that come with an economic slowdown. This will likely lead to a strong opposite reaction so that taxes are raised, but I can’t perfectly predict the future and what will come next. So, you take each vote as it comes and accept the tug-of-war that is politics to be the reality of what we will contend with as a result of this or any other bill.  Refundable Child Tax Credit Expanded  The Conference Report doubled the child tax credit to $2,000...up from $1,000 currently. To pay for this increase, the bill limited its availability to higher-income earners. It would also require a valid Social Security Number for each child claimed, which was not previously required. This credit would be refundable, which means that if the credit is more than the individual’s tax liability, the government still sends the taxpayer money.   This is really bad policy. The expansion was insisted upon by Senator Marco Rubio, and things like the Child Tax Credit represent social engineering of a Republican flavor. This component of the bill goes the opposite of what the bill is largely about, which is lowering marginal rates and increasing investment in capital in the United States. It’s particularly galling that someone that pays nothing in taxes will be getting a refund simply based on the number of children that they have. This is not the kind of policy that leads toward more in the way of capital formation. If one wants to add these sorts of things as a standalone bill, that’s a different debate with its own merits and demerits, but if you’re going to build a tax bill based on the idea of capital formation, we ought to narrowly restrict the code to things that do that.   I’m now at eight pages on my way to nine, and I guess it’s probably best that I call it quits in this analysis. The long and short here though is I end where I started: I believe that on the whole this bill does more good than bad. There are provisions that still disturb me, but I’ve learned to pray the Irish prayer on a lot of things and to focus on the things that I can effect and control. If I had a magic wand, I would certainly take provisions of this bill out. In fact, I think Senator Bob Corker said it best here when he said, “In the end, after 11 years in the Senate, I know every bill we consider is imperfect and the question becomes is our country better off with or without this piece of legislation. I think we are better off with it. I realize this is a bet on our country’s enterprising spirit, and that is a bet I am willing to make.”","status",NA,NA,235,259,52,17,1,0,11,128

I think there are two interesting thoughts on this….  One, I’ve said from the very beginning that fundamentally this was a corporate and business tax reduction and reform bill. That was the genesis of the bill and its original intent, though things were added so that there was some level of chicken in every pot as it relates to taxpayers and tax relief. That remains the case, which is why a great degree of the tax distribution still - not surprisingly - accrues to businesses and those that run them.  Two, more fundamentally what has been left out of this debate is the degree to which we have a progressive tax system and folks at the top are disproportionately taxed. In essence, half the population now pays no income tax, while the top 10% - consisting of those making more than $133,000 - pay 70% of the income taxes in the United States.  I’ve never been one to push for Jeff Bezos not having to pay some level of estate tax, and I’m certainly not a fan of rich folks that I don’t know...but a trucker married to a school administrator can easily have a combined income of $133,000. That doesn’t make them rich, but it does make them part of the cohort that pays 70% of the income taxes in the United States.

At the core, the tax bill was, among other things, about holding the present line on money coming into the federal government.  In my view, that’s good. But to make the numbers work, you have to concurrently hold the line on spending.   Less than 24 hours after the passage of the tax bill, Congress...and in particular the Republicans that hold control, are off to a bad start in efforts to do so.  Specifically, the House voted today on H.R. 4667, to provide for further disaster recovery spending. The bill passed 251 to 169, and I voted no.    It totaled $81 billion, which is nearly twice what the Trump administration requested ($44 billion). None of it was paid for...which means it’s cost is simply added to the national debt. Going forward, this needs to be recognized for the threat it really is. Non-offset...means taxation without representation...because it is the next generation we are jamming the tab to for this current spending.  The bill also represents the single largest funding request for natural disasters in our history. According to the Congressional Budget Office, less than 14 percent of that will actually be spent in fiscal year 2018 and only $67 billion of it will be spent by 2027. Money earmarked for spending ten years from now hardly strikes me as emergency.  The non-offset spending would bring total disaster funding this year to more than $130 billion, which is more than what was spent on Hurricane Katrina, and all of it has been entirely unpaid for.  There was a real need to help victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and recent wildfires, but we could have prioritized spending and made adjustments in other areas of governmental spending. That’s what families and businesses do rather than taking the easy option of just adding more with no effort to pay for the spending. Doing so cheapens aid. It’s not an expression of our own humanitarian tendencies but instead a cheap way forward paid for by our children. In other words, for aid to be real, it should be not only from the heart...but your wallet as well.   In some ways, this bill compounded taxpayer injury beyond what I just noted because indeed the $26.06 billion for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) in this bill make people affected by disasters as far back as Hurricane Sandy in 2012 eligible!!!  This is creative...emergency spending...from five years ago!  CDBG funding is not for emergency response or mitigation, so there is no immediate relief to victims of hurricanes or wildfires that can come from this spending. This money is for long-term projects, decidedly not emergencies.      Two more crazy examples in this bill of non- emergency spending made such:  The bill lifts a current $20 million annual cap on livestock insurance policies and contained an expansion of handouts to the cotton industry through a subsidy called the Price Loss Coverage program.  It provided salary and expenses for the Department of Justice (DOJ), specifically the Federal Prison System ($16 million), Drug Enforcement Agency ($11.5 million), FBI ($21.2 million), and U.S. Marshals Service ($2.5 million). These things may be worthy, but if so they should be debated rather than tucked in a bill that works outside the normal budget setting process.","status",NA,NA,93,180,32,4,3,9,7,58

In that vein, I wanted to circle back to a bill the House passed last month...the 21st Century Flood Reform Act. The bill extends the authorization of the National Flood Insurance Program for five years. Although I had some concerns with the bill, I voted yes on it because I believe that the legislation was an overall step in the right direction in bringing reforms that in some cases are long overdue.  It adjusts the way in which people’s annual premiums are set. It does this by taking into account risk levels, or the likelihood that their home will flood. This is similar to the way that your car insurance works. If you’re more likely to get in an accident, your premium goes up. The aim here is to begin some level of pricing consequence to people whose homes are flooded five or ten times.  It works to improve the program’s outdated risk zone maps. During Hurricane Harvey, it was estimated that roughly 80% of people whose homes flooded did not have flood insurance. In many cases, this was simply because they were not mapped into a risk zone. This bill would allow FEMA to approve risk maps that come from local communities and third-party sources...allowing FEMA to update maps far more quickly and accurately.    The bill also incentivizes people to better prepare against the next flood that would cause damage to their home. All too often, a person’s home will get flooded and then rebuilt in the same way - only to get flooded again. This bill sets aside funds for people to use to help better flood-proof their homes. FEMA has shown that every $1 spent on mitigation saves $4 down the line.   Finally, the legislation expands the private flood insurance market by allowing people to purchase non-government set private market policies. Historically, if a person wanted to buy flood insurance through a private company, that policy had to adhere to the government’s standards on a number of - in some cases - superfluous fronts. This bill would let private companies set their own policies and offer consumers choices. In these instances, the government’s policies could still act as a minimum for people, but the consumer would be free to shop around for other policies.  All this having been said, I still had some concerns with the legislation….  Earlier this fall, I voted against the expansion of the private flood insurance market because, at the time, there weren't any other reforms to the program overall. The expansion of the private market could allow for companies to come in and cherry pick lower risk insurance policies. This would leave each of us as federal taxpayers not only with the existing $24 billion debt on the program...but a real cash flow squeeze to boot.   Lastly, the program’s debt is still an issue. The National Flood Insurance Program is $24 billion in debt, and, on average, the National Flood Insurance Program runs at about a $1.4 billion annual shortfall. In 2017 alone, Congress voted to eliminate $16 billion of debt in the most recent disaster supplemental bill. The program also bought a reinsurance policy in order to pass over $1 billion in debt to the private sector. The legislation that we voted on last month did not have any substantial answers to dealing with the debts still inherent in the existing program.","status",NA,NA,25,18,6,0,0,0,0,7

Well, they’re still around...and we took a vote just last month to go ahead and put them to death, given practical and constitutional grounds that warranted doing so.  Indeed, the House passed legislation to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) by a vote of 307 to 111. I voted yes on the bill.   Here was my reasoning….  IPAB was created under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to control Medicare costs. It allowed the board or the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to cut reimbursement payments for doctors and hospitals and to restrict benefits...without congressional approval. My main concerns with IPAB and the reasons I voted to repeal it were twofold. First, it was an improper delegation of authority to unelected bureaucrats. Second, the potential cuts could have hurt seniors by inadvertently rationing their health care.   With respect to the improper delegation of authority…our government is said to be “of the people, by the people, and for the people.” Indeed, Article I of the Constitution vests all legislative powers in Congress. Yet, under the ACA, a board of unelected bureaucrats was empowered to make changes to Medicare without direction from Congress. That is not the way our republican system of government is supposed to work. Rather, it is the people’s representatives in Congress that are meant to give them a voice and allow them to participate in the many policy decisions that impact them. This is even more obviously the case when it comes to major programs, such as Medicare.   Currently, Medicare provides health insurance to more than 57 million people. In 2016, spending for this one program made up 15 percent of the total federal budget, and that is projected to rise to 17.5 percent by 2027. Medicare is the third largest federal program behind defense and Social Security. It seems to me that both the Constitution and basic issues of fairness require congressional approval for any changes to this program.   As to the second matter, cuts to physicians and hospitals may have resulted in rationed health care for seniors. This is because lower reimbursement rates could push doctors out of the program, as it makes less and less economic sense to keep seeing Medicare patients. That would  leave seniors with fewer health care options. Fewer providers could also mean seniors are not able to see their doctor when they need to. The board also had authority to pick and choose and deny treatments and medical services. Additionally, the IPAB process for determining when cuts would be made could have required significant cuts over a single year; that kind of abrupt change would be difficult for providers and their patients. All of this adds up to being counterproductive for getting seniors access to affordable health care.   Medicare is already under financial pressure, largely due to demographic factors and general rising health care costs. As baby-boomers continue to age, Medicare’s eligible population will double. The Trustees report from July indicates that the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which finances inpatient hospital coverage, will be fully depleted in 2029, this is only 12 years from now. If that happens, Medicare will not be able to pay 12 percent of what it owes. I believe Congress needs to address these sustainability issues sooner rather than later, because the longer these financial issues go unaddressed, the harder the choices are going to become. It is likely to mean some combination of benefit cuts, eligibility changes, cost-sharing increases, reductions to provider payments, and/or tax increases. Payroll taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), which fund Social Security and part of Medicare and which both employer and employee pay a part, are already 15.3 percent for those who make under $200,000 a year. So the point here is decisions that are tough now will only get tougher the longer Congress waits to act.  So, the bottomline is I believe Congress should address Medicare’s financial sustainability. The reasoning behind IPAB was legitimate in that regard, but the way in which it attempted to address the issue would come at a real cost to seniors in need of healthcare and the balance of power as outlined in the separation of powers by the Founding Fathers.","status",NA,NA,198,156,81,8,3,3,3,47

We were able to get this language into the Disaster Recovery Reform Act, which emphasizes pre-disaster mitigation and would make critical reforms to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster response and recovery program. We did this on November 30th in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Subsequently, we were able to get that bill into the larger Disaster Recovery Reform Act of last week. The bill also touches on other issues ranging from wildfire prevention to eligibility for disaster assistance. But what’s relevant for all of us along the coast is that our language aimed to enhance the long-term viability of public investment in flood-prone areas. Specifically, it would require consensus based codes, specifications, and standards in these federally-backed investments.  What’s that mean in plain English? You don’t build a school a foot above sea level when it’s prone to be flooded awfully regularly by a king tide if you did so.   This last year’s hurricane season was one of the busiest on record producing seventeen named storms, three of which were above category three. It was also the most costly season in American history, with estimated damages surpassing $400 billion. As a comparison, the previous most expensive hurricane season was in 2005 with Hurricane Katrina, and that cost $143 billion.  And even as this year’s hurricane season officially ended on November 30th, meteorologists are already predicting next year’s being even worse….   This focus on working to fix the problem before it happens is, I think, vital. Indeed, every dollar invested in pre-disaster mitigation saves $4 in avoided future damages. Accordingly, earlier this year, I led a letter to the administration along with 14 of my colleagues asking for improvements to our federal flood-ready infrastructure standard. Simply put, a stronger flood-ready standard would help to ensure that when disasters strike, taxpayer dollars haven’t been wasted on public infrastructure that can’t stand up to hurricanes like we’ve seen this year.  This was in response to the president actually rolling back a provision on this front that made sense if you are looking at public investment in flood-prone areas.  I think we could all agree that it’s time that the federal government stop simply writing blank checks after predictable disasters and start looking at preventative measures to try and lessen the damage from annual storm seasons. In that vein, take a look at The Post and Courier article below….","link","https://www.postandcourier.com/news/south-carolina-could-face-worse-after-horrific-hurricane-season/article_f214b4c2-ca0f-11e7-a654-27226da59ac4.html","postandcourier.com",44,27,8,1,1,3,1,2

What was in play was in fact more than just keeping government open because tucked into the continuing resolution was, among other things, an 8-year reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This was a big deal because, depending on one’s perspective, lawmakers were either working to quietly reinstate the law’s program or, in my case, working with others to resist and stall so that we might see real changes or even the end to what has taken place under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  At the end, we were able to get a compromise. A number of conservatives would vote yes on the continuing resolution so that the government would stay open through January 19th in exchange for an open and separate debate and vote on our surveillance activities before the temporary reauthorization ends on January 19th.   If you care about limiting government, you should care about this issue. In fact, for the Fourth Amendment to mean anything, you cannot continue what our nation is doing in section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Individual liberty and personal privacy are two of the hallmarks of the American experiment, and current law compels American companies to assist in what would amount to warrantless surveillance. It was intended for foreigners, but once the information is in their database, they now routinely are able to look at Americans’ communications without a warrant.   This should be a sticking point for all of us because, again, the Fourth Amendment is absolutely crystal clear as it says: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”   Intelligence services have not lived up to the Founding Fathers’ clearly described threshold of probable cause and the need for a warrant in looking through America’s personal communications.   As you may know, the idea behind the Fourth Amendment was based on the Founding Fathers’ frustration with British soldiers coming into a person’s house and looking long enough until they found something with which to charge American citizens. The Founding Fathers believed that none of us were perfect, and if one rooted around long enough, something could be found that would be, if not unlawful, then at least uncomfortable for most any of us when viewed by others or put into public light.   What’s been most interesting on this subject is how, once again, the Founding Fathers were right in their design of our system. They designed a system of checks and balances recognizing that governments are run by imperfect people. The latest revelations of actions by some in the FBI absolutely cements how right they were in putting in place these balancing measures.   In short, what was going on in the continuing resolution was indeed a big deal if you care about liberty and sustaining American Freedom. We were able to get our vote and stop what would have been an eight-year reauthorization of a program that deserves both review and change.   To get a better idea of my view of how Section 702 ought to change, I’d ask that you take a look at the USA Rights Act. I’ve included a link below that will take you to more information, if you'd like to learn more.","link","https://sanford.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/sanford-cosponsors-usa-rights-act","sanford.house.gov",24,23,8,2,0,0,0,0
