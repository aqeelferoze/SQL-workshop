It demonstrates that President Trump is committed to keeping the promises he made to the American people. He will rebuild our military. The budget’s $54 billion increase in defense spending is much needed, and I fully support the increase in military funding. Additionally, President Trump promised to secure our borders, and this budget lays the groundwork for building a wall and taking the necessary steps to ensure our nation’s border security.   However, I have several concerns about significant cuts to local programs, which I believe go too far. I worked for more than two years to help write and pass the 21st Century Cures Initiative, and I fully believe that the funding guidelines established in that legislation must be followed. The $5.8 billion cut to NIH is drastic. I will do whatever I can to ensure that the Appropriations Committee recognizes how crucial medical research is to Western New York and the millions of Americans whose lives could be saved with better medical research.   The Great Lakes are a crucial part of Western New York’s economy. I have always fought to protect them and have voted to increase funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative at every opportunity. I will do the same this time around. Western New Yorkers can rest assured I will be fighting tooth and nail to restore the program’s funding.   Agriculture plays a significant role in Western New York’s economy. This budget eliminates the Water and Wastewater loan and grant program, which helps rural areas alleviate the financial burden of maintaining wastewater programs. I have always fought hard to support this program and this year will be no different.   Over the next few months, I will continue to evaluate this budget. Ultimately, it is up to the Appropriations Committee to fund these programs and I will be strongly advocating for Western New York’s best interests.","status",NA,NA,113,116,5,6,3,0,0,32

I commend the families of Flight 3407 that worked tirelessly to get this important measure put in place. This database will not only create a more accurate and efficient way of checking pilot records, but will keep our skies safer.   https://chriscollins.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/faa-releases-beta-test-of-online-pilot-records-database","link","https://chriscollins.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/faa-releases-beta-test-of-online-pilot-records-database","chriscollins.house.gov",18,55,4,0,0,1,0,0

Chris Collins","2017-12-19","2017-12-19 21:41:33","Today the House passed historic tax reform legislation, despite Governor Cuomo and the liberal left’s lies and misinformation. #GovernorGrinch went so far as to justify a government shutdown over this bill, that will put more money in the pockets of Western New York families. I voted today to fix our broken tax code and to lower taxes for my constituents. This is a monumental victory that will mean more jobs and higher wages for the hard-working families in Western New York. I'm fighting for working families across Western New York and the Finger Lakes and this bill will be on President Trump’s desk by Christmas.","status",NA,NA,539,502,29,70,11,4,7,217

My office collected over 1,500 holiday cards and delivered them to veterans at the Buffalo and Batavia VA facilities. I extend my very best to our veterans and active duty personnel and their families this holiday season.
