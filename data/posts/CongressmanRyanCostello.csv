""He was very articulate and very honest - even when my students asked him some tough questions,"" he said.    Thanks to the students Governor Mifflin Senior High School for a great, candid discussion and to the Reading Eagle and Reading Eagle - Karen Shuey for sharing some of our Q&A:  U.S. Rep. Ryan Costello takes questions from Gov. Mifflin students Tuesday February 21, 2017 12:01 AM By Karen Shuey SHILLINGTON, PA  A group of Gov. Mifflin High School students were treated to a civics lesson from their congressman Tuesday.  U.S. Rep. Ryan Costello, the two-term Republican who represents a portion of Berks County, spoke about his role in the House of Representative and took questions on a variety of topics. The questions covered everything from the impact of partisan polarization to how often he votes with his party to how President Donald Trump has handled his first month in office.  He began the forum by sharing his personal journey from a township supervisor to a federal legislator. He then explained what issues he deals with in committee, discussed his daily routine and urged students to take an active interest in politics.   Costello also pointed out that he is one of only 23 Republican lawmakers who represent a congressional district the president lost. While he defeated his opponent by more than 14 percentage points, Hillary Clinton won the race at the top of the ticket by a narrow margin.  Teacher Chris Hole said the crash course in politics informed and inspired his AP government students.  ""He was very articulate and very honest - even when my students asked him some tough questions,"" he said.  Here are some of those questions.   What's your view of the Trump administration? ""I don't have a conclusive assessment of the administration because it's still in its infancy. I will say that I believe there have been some missteps: The rollout of the executive order on immigration was problematic, his continued use of Twitter and his confrontational approach to the media isn't conducive to getting things done. Then there are some good actions he has taken to undo regulations that President Obama approved on his way out the door. But it's too early to speak with certitude as to what my assessment is at this point.""  How has the discourse surrounding Trump affected you? ""I've had about eight protests outside my district offices since the election. Many of them are local Democrats but some of them are people who have never been politically active in their lives. I think anytime people are assembling to voice their opinion on something is a good thing. We should always remind ourselves that the First Amendment gives us the right to speak critically about our government. And some people have very legitimate concerns when it comes to the immigration order or the plan to fix the Affordable Care Act.""  Do most of your views fall in line with your party? ""Yes. There are about a quarter of the bills we vote on where we have some philosophical difference. It could be on cultural issues, it could be on spending items, it could be on taxing policy, it could be on foreign affairs, it could be on investigations out of the oversight committee. And, generally speaking, I tend to vote Republican on those issues. But, if you were to look at the 241 Republicans in the House of Representatives, I would be classified as one of the most moderate members.""  What impact does gerrymandering districts have on politics? ""It doesn't contribute to people working together. When you have districts like mine that are more competitive, it forces elected officials to govern more from the middle. But if you look at urban districts in Philadelphia or rural districts in Alabama, those districts are almost entirely one party so that the representative is always going to win provided that no one is more liberal or more conservative than them. That creates more division in Congress.""  How are you fighting against the acts of hate we see? ""You have to speak out when you feel it's appropriate. Reacting to things Trump says or does is something that every elected official is being asked to do right now and I try not to do that too much because that ends up being the only thing people read about you. And then they evaluate whether you're an effective lawmaker based on whether they agree with what Trump said or did. I have my own job to do. I always have to judge if it's worth me weighing in on something or not. But, hey, I chose to do this.""  Would you like to run for higher office? ""I'm never running for president. If I decided to run for governor or a seat in the Senate, it would be at least a couple more years down the road. I'm not itching to do it but I'm not saying never."" ________________________________________ KAREN SHUEY | REPORTER Karen Shuey is the breaking news reporter at the Reading Eagle.","link","http://www.readingeagle.com/news/article/us-rep-ryan-costello-takes-questions-from-students","readingeagle.com",19,13,3,0,0,0,0,0

This program provides critical in-home non-medical support, including assistance with bathing, dressing, meal preparation, and money management, to individuals with disabilities and the elderly. Without PCS, many vulnerable individuals would have no other option besides moving to a nursing home or other institutionalized setting, but PCS services improve the quality of life of beneficiaries by allowing them to remain in their homes and communities. Reports of individuals who depend on PCS care falling victim to abuse or neglect - even resulting in death in some tragic instances - are too frequent. Many more cases go unreported due to insufficient, inaccurate, and untimely data collection. As a Member of E&C, I will continue working to conduct oversight and enact necessary legislative changes to improve the integrity of the PCS program, prevent abuse before it can occur, and better identify and prosecute instances of fraud.","status",NA,NA,27,56,1,2,0,0,0,0

In Pennsylvania, many consumers and small businesses rely on these financial institutions for mortgages, car loans, and every day banking. But one-size-fits-all regulations implemented under Dodd-Frank hurt these banks, as they are not equipped to comply with regulations targeted at large financial institutions. In fact, over 500 bank branches in PA closed under the regulatory weight of Dodd-Frank. The Financial CHOICE Act would increase competition and economic growth by creating a regulatory framework small banks are able to comply with – allowing them to focus on serving their customers. The bill will also bolster accountability and toughen consequences to crack down on instances of fraud, insider trading, or other acts of corruption on Wall Street.

Lack of broadband coverage might be to blame, especially if you’re located in a rural and remote area. Due to terrain and population, these locations often do not experience the same levels of broadband deployment as highly populated urban and suburban areas.    Tomorrow’s Energy and Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Communications and Technology hearing will explore how funding for broadband deployment can be disbursed most efficiently to provide better coverage for consumers in unserved and underserved areas. Accurate, timely data from broadband coverage maps plays a key role in this effort.

Last Congress, as a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I helped this effort become law.  This session, I have been working to make sure it gets the funding necessary to become a reality.    I am pleased to see my efforts with Congressman Patrick Meehan have resulted in securing $500 million in funding for the NEC to restore existing rail assets along the corridor and address the backlog of deferred maintenance.

A zero-carbon gas or coal plant that runs on carbon, and then can captures it at no extra cost. An advanced reactor that’s cheap, scalable, and reduces nuclear waste. A carbon capture retrofit that not only captures power plant pollution, its fuel cell simultaneously produces clean electricity. These are not scenes from a 1970s Sci-Fi movie – these are examples of promising clean energy innovations occurring right now.    This week is National Clean Energy Week (NCEW). I spoke at the NCEW Symposium about addressing the advancement of clean energy solutions. This opportunity is one of several over the course of this week that will bring together leaders from government, the private sector, and leading non-profits to discuss the growing role that clean energy can play as part of our American energy future.    If we make a commitment to accelerate American innovation in clean energy, we will generate new American technology, create more American jobs, grow our economy, and provide affordable energy choices that protect our environment.  Importantly, any growth and development in domestic clean energy will move us closer to another priority that many of us share –greater American energy independence.   Stay tuned to learn more about some of my ideas on what can we do to take advantage of the momentum we have to accelerate clean energy innovation.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/NationalCleanEnergyWeek/photos/a.1934863630062214.1073741828.1905497422998835/1945374555677788/?type=3",NA,51,10,0,4,0,0,0,0

The bill at issue provided clarity for the DEA to issue immediate suspension orders, a measure aimed at shutting down the illegal and excessive distribution of opiates into the pharmaceutical supply chain. At a hearing today, I asked several questions to the DEA Deputy Administrator charged with implementing the law. He testified that:  the DEA recommended that President Obama sign the law;  the DEA provided assistance in drafting the law; the number of suspension orders has increased since passage of the law (thus stopping unauthorized/illegal/excessive opiates distribution); and the number of opiates manufactured and distributed has decreased since passage of the law.   If any revisions to the bill are advisable subsequent to additional DEA and Department of Justice input, we should revise the law. But for those who saw the news piece or have read subsequent national and local coverage of the law, and have questions, the facts came forward at the hearing today. I will continue my efforts to combat this crisis with local officials and in Congress. Another piece of legislation I voted for, which is now law, secured $1 billion to do just that -- including $26 million dollars this year alone for Pennsylvania to combat the epidemic. I encourage you to watch my questioning.","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanRyanCostello/videos/2111717315722095/",NA,34,17,3,0,0,3,0,0
