The White House listed the four actions as follows: 1. An immediate re-evaluation of the so-called Clean Power Plan. 2. A lift on the ban on federal leasing for coal production. 3. An end to job-killing restrictions on the production of oil, natural gas, clean coal and shale energy. 4. Returning regulatory power to the states.  Congressman Griffith said, “The actions outlined in President Trump’s Executive Order will bring relief to the coal and energy industries that have been under regulatory attack for the last eight years.” “I am pleased that President Trump and his Administration have decided not to proceed with plans to implement the costly, overreaching Clean Power Plan.   From the start, I believed the federal bureaucrats at the EPA had no legal basis for implementing a policy that would have such a negative impact on our local and national economies.” “The Trump Administration is correct in assessing that there was no legal authority for this unprecedented power grab, and I am hoping to see the CPP dismantled.” “The effects of the CPP’s excessive and misguided regulations threatened the livelihoods of hardworking American families and jeopardized thousands of jobs.

As a Christian, I believe Christ sacrificed himself for us so our sins could be forgiven and we could be redeemed. On religious holidays such as Easter, I am particularly thankful for our religious freedom.  No matter what you believe, we are lucky to live in America where we have religious freedom.  I am deeply troubled by attacks with religious motivation, such as the recent bombings at Palm Sunday services in Egypt.   I am reminded this Easter of a story I included in a 2014 newsletter, the story of a journey reportedly taken by a Russian Communist leader, Nikolai Bukharin, who had taken part in the Bolshevik Revolution.  As the story goes, Bukharin traveled from Moscow to Kiev (which is now the capital of Ukraine, an independent nation) in order to address a large crowd of Communists on the subject of atheism.   You see, communism was officially atheistic.   As stated by Karl Marx, one of the founders of communist thought, “Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions.  It is the opium of the people.”  Following his remarks against faith, Bukharin looked at the audience and asked if there were any questions.  A man then approached, and he mounted the platform.  Looking out at the crowd assembled before him – despite Bukharin’s anti-faith remarks that had preceded him – this second man is said to have shouted, “Christ is risen!”  Those before him stood and shouted back, “He is risen indeed!”  This story involving Nikolai Bukharin is told often.  We have not found a primary source historical reference to it.  However, I cannot imagine that this is a story that the Communists would have ensured was officially recorded.  But what a powerful story it is!  “He is risen indeed!”  On this Easter Sunday, I extend my prayers to all of you: Christians, those of other faiths, and yes, also atheists, because I believe all mankind needs redemption, myself particularly.  - Congressman Griffith","status",NA,NA,63,27,4,2,0,0,0,3

The United States can be the world leader in energy innovation; this symbolic, expensive, and poorly negotiated deal doesn’t change that.  The United States is ALREADY a clean energy and fossil fuel energy leader; we can reduce our emissions and continue to produce American energy without the Paris Accord.  America has already reduced its carbon-dioxide emissions dramatically, beginning before the Accord.”   “I believe that the United States should and can have an energy policy that both improves the environment and protects jobs. The President has made the right choice.”   “President Obama committed $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund, which is about 30 percent of the initial funding, without authorization from Congress. With $20 trillion in debt, the U.S. taxpayers should not be paying billions or trillions to subsidize other countries’ energy needs to the detriment of our jobs.”   “United States taxpayers should not be responsible for contributing to a slush fund for the UN’s use.”   “Our country is in a better position today thanks to the President’s actions. I look forward to working with his Administration and my colleagues in Congress to craft and implement an energy policy that allows for the responsible use of our natural resources, improves our environment, and creates jobs.”","status",NA,NA,220,158,50,25,1,3,7,142

The plants were shut down to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Mercury Air Toxics Standards rule (which the Supreme Court later ruled was improperly issued).  However, PJM Interconnections, a company that manages the electrical grid in many eastern states, including Virginia, requested the plants be allowed to temporarily remain open in order to provide reliable power to residents.  The Department of Energy (DOE) approved their request.   PJM’s spokesperson told a local paper, Williamsburg Yorktown Daily, that Dominion Energy would operate the coal-fired power plants on an emergency basis to prevent rolling black-outs, and added that this move is “required to avoid power disruption that could disturb military bases, hospitals, and other critical infrastructure in the area.”  Congressman Griffith said, “It is critically important to maintain the reliability of the power grid.  The threats of rolling brown-outs, and even black-outs, have been a concern of mine for some time.  As I’ve said before, if we shut down power plants before we have an adequate substitute, the obvious result will be families, schools, businesses, and hospitals lacking power.  By re-opening these plants, thankfully, Virginians will be in a position to avoid power shortages during the hottest months of summer.  I’m glad DOE made the logical decision.”","status",NA,NA,155,61,56,8,0,1,7,30

The topic of the modern filibuster/cloture/hold rule has been a consistent theme of this column no matter what party controls the Senate or the White House. When I have written on this topic in the past:  11.16.12: Democrats controlled the Senate and White House 9.22.14: Democrats controlled the Senate and White House 11.3.14: Democrats controlled the Senate and White House 12.15.14: Democrats controlled the Senate and White House, but it was known that Republicans would take control of the Senate in January 2.23.15: Republicans controlled the Senate and Democrats controlled the White House 3.2.15: Republicans controlled the Senate and Democrats controlled the White House 11.6.15: Republicans controlled the Senate and Democrats controlled the White House 11.4.16: Republicans controlled the Senate and Democrats controlled the White House 4.7.17: Republicans controlled the Senate and the White House  As I wrote on November 3, 2014, immediately before an election where control of the Senate was at stake, “this is not about party politics.  It is about making the system work as it was intended.”   I firmly believe this rule is bad for the Republic, regardless of whether or not it is good for the Democrats or the Republicans. If Republicans lost control of the Senate, this would still be my position. A majority has to be able to govern. Requiring 60 votes to pass almost anything or even debate it does not let the will of the people rule.","status",NA,NA,61,64,2,3,2,0,0,10

National security is jeopardized when we don’t know who is entering and leaving. The rule of law is diminished. Opportunities for legal immigrants who follow the rules are closed.  “Dangerous and addicting substances routinely cross the border. The 2016 National Drug Threat Assessment found that Mexican Transnational Criminal Organizations, which control smuggling corridors across the border, are the biggest criminal drug threat to the United States. Lax border security has fueled the opioid epidemic, the ready availability of meth, fentanyl, and the resurgence of cocaine. Parts of the country far from the border are in pain because the Federal Government didn’t do enough to control who or what entered our territory.  “Fortunately, the Trump Administration has shown that it takes enforcement seriously. The proof is in the numbers. Apprehensions at the border from January 1 to July 31 of this year are almost half of what they were in the same period last year, a sign that many are choosing not to risk illegal border crossings.     “We should build on this success to further guarantee the integrity of our borders. To that end, I supported the inclusion of funding for a border wall in the appropriations bill the House passed last month and urge that it be kept in any bill to fund the government.”","link","https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398780","morgangriffith.house.gov",116,89,13,9,3,0,4,20

It was an ordinary Tuesday in my office until my bookkeeper and Andrew Lewis High School classmate, Terry Haynie, called me into her office, saying she had seen on the news that a plane had hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center. We could not understand how such an accident could happen. Then we saw the second plane hit the South Tower, and knew that it was no accident.  “We can never forget the 3,000 innocent lives lost that day at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and on Flight 93. They died simply because they had gone to work or boarded a flight.  “On a day of unimaginable evil, however, many people performed great deeds, even gave their lives, so that others might live. The heroes of that day proved that America will not be broken.  “On this 9/11, let us reflect on the tragedy that unfolded 16 years ago, and let us resolve never to forget.”","link","https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398789","morgangriffith.house.gov",18,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Led by Colonel Andrew Lewis, the victory of these frontiersmen allowed settlers to come across the ridge of the Appalachians and settle in the Kentucky territory of Virginia and parts of Tennessee. Due to all the settlers who crossed the mountains, after the Revolutionary War, the British ceded the newly-formed United States of America land all the way to the Mississippi, not just to the ridge of the Appalachians.

The bill would streamline the licensing process the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) uses on closed-loop pumped storage projects. It would also require FERC to hold a workshop focused on potential opportunities for development of closed-loop pumped storage projects at abandoned mine sites. Congressman Griffith issued the following statement:  “I applaud my House colleagues for supporting this commonsense bill to promote closed-loop pumped storage hydropower. This technology is a job creator and an asset for a true ‘all of the above’ energy policy. I have promoted it as a great idea for the Virginia coalfields because we have the infrastructure ready to support closed-loop pumped storage projects, but sites around the country would benefits from these projects as well. My bill makes the process of licensing them easier, and I hope today’s vote will serve as an encouragement to companies looking at closed-loop storage, whether in or out of a mine.”","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepMorganGriffith/videos/1651025538289081/",NA,70,22,10,0,0,2,0,1
