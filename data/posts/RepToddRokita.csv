Today we passed the American Health Care Act, H.R. 1628, which will repeal major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, and create a new patient-centered approach that will improve care for all Americans.   The bill includes major reforms to Medicaid that I fought for.  We would end the current open-ended system that encourages waste and fraud, and instead gives states the flexibility and authority to run their own programs.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepToddRokita/photos/a.183949434962648.44584.183180288372896/1578340822190162/?type=3",NA,126,362,34,14,1,0,6,252

The VPP was created in 1982 to promote effective worksite-based safety and health but has yet to be codified into law.  My bill would do so.  In the VPP, management, labor, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) establish a cooperative relationship at workplaces that have implemented a comprehensive safety and health management system. Approval into VPP is OSHA’s official recognition of the outstanding efforts of employers and employees who have achieved exemplary occupational safety and health.  Currently more than 2,200 worksites participate in the program covering approximately 900,000 employees.
