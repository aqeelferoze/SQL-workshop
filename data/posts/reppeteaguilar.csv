Democrats have asked Republicans to work together for years to improve the Affordable Care Act. Rather than work together to make our current system work for all Americans, Republicans drafted a new bill in secret, concealed it from the public and rammed it through two committee markup sessions in less than 48 hours. This is not how governing should work. We cannot risk stripping millions of people of their health insurance, including those in San Bernardino County, so House Republicans can pass a bill they don’t even know the full repercussions of. http://bit.ly/2nmb8rI","link","http://bit.ly/2nmb8rI","bit.ly",75,11,6,1,0,0,0,0
