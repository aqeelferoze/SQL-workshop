He or she is responsible for advancing our national interests and keeping true to our core values. That means this person must have the knowledge base and skill set to represent American principles and pursue peace through diplomacy. After reviewing his record and his testimony before the Senate, I do not believe Mr. Tillerson is the right person to lead the State Department.  From international human rights to the grave threats facing our country, Mr. Tillerson’s views do not align with well-established, bipartisan foreign policy. The United States has built our global leadership on a foundation of core American values of liberty and justice for all—values that were missing from Mr. Tillerson’s testimony in his nomination hearing. The concerns I had regarding the South China Sea and Russia also deepened as we went through the confirmation process.  Some of those concerns bleed into questions about Mr. Tillerson’s knowledge of U.S. diplomacy and his ability to translate his skills from ExxonMobil to the State Department. Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Tillerson outlined his vision – one that would support short-term military operations rather than long-term global engagement.  It is a view that is inconsistent with the mission of the State Department and, in fact, overlaps with the Department of Defense.  The next secretary of state will need to argue for our values and our priorities with friends and adversaries alike. This leader will also have a historic number of vacant senior career professional positions that risk being filled with people who don’t know how to run the State Department and our embassies overseas. At a time when our country is facing a historic variety of challenges in almost every part of the world, there is no safety net to catch an inexperienced diplomat. That is a risk we cannot afford to take. I will vote no on his nomination to lead the State Department.","link","http://www.schatz.senate.gov/press-releases/schatz-to-oppose-rex-tillerson-for-secretary-of-state","schatz.senate.gov",502,94,47,51,0,0,0,2

It famously went viral—and brought people from 60 countries on seven continents out into the streets. It was the single largest gathering of people to march for a cause in history.   I was proud to be a part of the March, just as I was proud that it all started with one woman who decided she would not stand by in silence. #InternationalWomensDay","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenBrianSchatz/photos/a.357847780986702.1073741828.357806137657533/1086706484767491/?type=3",NA,159,14,9,37,1,1,0,1

Here’s their proposal: to cut taxes for corporations—again— but this time, have American families pay for it through taxes on groceries and other goods we all rely on. We’ve seen this before—it’s a giveaway for corporations and wealthy people. But, as usual, we have to find a way to pay for it. So they’re going to keep proposing so-called solutions for health care, infrastructure, or in this case, they’re calling it tax reform. But make no mistake: they’re all the same proposal. It’s a subsidy for Wall Street.  Last week, we saved health care for 24 million Americans because people across the country stood up to fight. This week, the fight goes on—and once again, far too many people are in the cross-hairs. I believe that, so long as we continue to stand together, we can win this one too.

We can start by making sure dangerous guns don’t end up in the wrong hands. And we can do this by applying comprehensive and rigorous background checks and closing loopholes that allow terrorists to buy weapons and let others get around registration rules by buying guns online. People who fail a background check or who are too dangerous to get on an airplane should be too dangerous to own a gun.   We can also try to prevent mass shootings by limiting the kinds of guns that are sold. The shooter in Las Vegas took less than 15 minutes to kill 58 people and injure more than 500. It’s unbelievable. By banning dangerous high-powered assault firearms and high-capacity ammunition and holding gun manufacturers more accountable, we can make sure weapons that are more suited for a war zone aren’t sold in our communities.   And finally, we need to find more ways to identify and stop potential killers. This means addressing the connections between gun violence and issues like mental health or domestic violence.

He is in the vanguard of special interests that seek to undermine the National Weather Service’s ability to do anything other than provide free data and weather models to private companies like his, which then turn around and sell their forecasts.   Mr. Myers will have to work very hard to persuade me that he will run NOAA for the public good—instead of trying to run it out of the business of saving lives and property and protecting our national security with its weather forecasts.  Since Mr. Myers and his two brothers own and operate AccuWeather, he will also need to explain why his service as NOAA Administrator will not violate conflict of interest rules and regulations.   Additionally Mr. Myers will need to persuade me that he has the expertise to manage the nation's leading ocean agency, which oversees commercial and recreational fisheries, coastal land stewardship, and the conservation of endangered marine species, when he does not have any formal scientific education or training.   I will keep an open mind throughout our Senate review of his nomination, but I am disappointed that this administration would nominate someone with Mr. Myers' controversial views on the National Weather Service, especially given the potential for conflicts of interest involving his family and his scant qualifications to run the rest of the agency.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2017/10/12/trump-taps-barry-myers-accuweather-ceo-to-head-noaa-choice-seen-as-controversial/?utm_term=.6e432e8ff479","washingtonpost.com",120,101,115,2,7,40,26,208

People had to find the courage to come out to their friends, their family, and their co-workers, and ask them to stand up for LGBT rights.   This year feels a little different. Because in 2017, the Trump administration has rolled back the clock and erased some of the gains we’ve made on protecting LGBT Americans from discrimination in schools, at work, and in our military.  We’ve taken a few steps back this year, and we’re going to have to fight even harder in pursuit of equality.

This move will take away your ability to use the internet the way you want to and instead give it to internet service providers. It’s time to make net neutrality a voting issue – and a movement.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/net-neutrality-fans-speak-up-as-fcc-set-to-strike-down-rules/2017/12/08/4721f310-dc41-11e7-a241-0848315642d0_story.html?utm_term=.9c1a2689cf7c","washingtonpost.com",140,58,70,4,3,4,11,57

Because of Chairman Pai and the other Republican commissioners, there are no longer any rules in place to stop internet service providers from changing the internet as we know it. They are now free to block apps, slow websites, or even limit access to certain kinds of content.

In this bill we are telling people that we value work less than we value already being rich. There’s nothing with somebody who has been successful but to the extent that passive income now is taxed at a lower rate than people who actually earn their money the old fashioned way by working it, that’s a reflection of values and I think that’s why people are so concerned about us entering into a new gilded age.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenBrianSchatz/videos/1335217496583054/",NA,302,133,76,14,2,4,37,51
