His service to our nation and this community spanned more than six decades, both on the local and national level. Holle spent over 40 years as an announcer, director, writer, producer and Program Director at Birmingham’s NBC 13 before retiring in 1991, earning numerous awards and being inducted into the Alabama Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame in 2012. In the 1950s, Holle was pulled out of what was supposed to be a two-year stint in the U.S. Army and sent to Washington, D.C., where he led the United States Army’s Radio, TV and Motion Picture department. His military service continued with numerous assignments with the  87th US Army Maneuver Area Command until Holle retired as Brigadier General in 1985. In recognition of his work in the field of communication, the University of Alabama College of Communication and Information Sciences annually gives the Holle Awards for Excellence and Creativity in Communication. General Holle was a tireless volunteer to many organizations, including the Boy Scouts of America where he served on the Executive Board and for which he received numerous awards. More personally, I remember Everett Holle for his work as a broadcaster on Channel 13. I am honored that General Holle served the 6th Congressional District for many years as a member of the Military Academy Nominating Committee, interviewing students from Alabama’s 6th Congressional District for appointments to this nations’ military academies. My family, my staff, and I send our prayers to General Holles’ family and friends. He was a giant in our community and will be sorely missed.","status",NA,NA,47,5,6,0,0,0,19,0

Congress established the award in 1979 to recognize initiative, achievement and service in young people in four areas: voluntary public service, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition or exploring.  In earning her Congressional Medal Award Bronze medal, Madison volunteered at her local library and planned events for the children’s department. She learned the importance of patience and improved in her ability to work and direct others. For her Personal Development, Madison planted a garden and grew vegetables for her family. She learned how to prepare the soil and how to keep the garden thriving throughout the year. Madison’s Physical Fitness goal was to increase her strength to do 20 push-ups. For her Expedition, Madison spent three days and two nights exploring the historical sites in Clayton, Georgia, learning about the town and what it was like from the 1800s-to-1900s.  Madison, a junior who homeschools through the Shades Mountain Independent Church Academy, is the daughter of  Melissa and Barry Smith. She has learned how to set a goal and push herself beyond what she may have thought she was capable, and for that she is awarded the Congressional Medal Award Bronze Medal. Congratulations to Madison Jones. We look forward to seeing what she accomplishes in the future.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanGaryPalmer/photos/a.577211322409437.1073741828.545855605545009/1067352806728617/?type=3",NA,40,0,1,2,0,0,0,0

By attaching funding for the victims of Hurricane Harvey to a short-term debt-limit increase the Texas and Louisiana victims of Hurricane Harvey were made hostage to the vote on the debt limit that denied us any opportunity to get needed changes in government spending. Earlier in the week I joined my colleagues in voting for the first round of funding for FEMA to continue to provide much-needed relief for the Hurricane Harvey victims. I am more than willing to continue to provide that support in a way that makes sense and does not allow massive amounts of pork spending to be included. That said, America is facing another gathering storm, but it is not a natural storm, it is a fiscal storm that will affect every man, woman, boy and girl in our country if we do not take appropriate action.

It was a somber and moving reminder that each name represented a loved one...a son or daughter, a husband or wife, a brother or sister...a family.   Today we remember those who were lost and those who have given their lives in defense of our freedom since that day, including the 106 Alabama servicemen and women.

With Constitution Day being just yesterday, these words from Thomas Jefferson should resonate with all Americans, especially those who serve in public office. The Constitution binds us down from the mischief of discriminating against individuals based on religion, and this includes those of the Catholic faith.  Senator Dianne Feinstein, in a recent confirmation hearing for Amy Barrett, nominated to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, ignored the establishing a religious test chain, and accused Ms. Barrett of being unable to follow the law because of her religion.  An individuals deeply held religious beliefs cannot and should not bar them from public service. Those who revere the document should pursue public service. Senator Feinstein and others need to be reminded of this on Constitution Day and every day.","status",NA,NA,85,31,6,4,1,0,1,7

The American people have been waiting over three decades for this kind of reform and I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will move quickly so that we can reconcile differences and make improvements in order to deliver on the promise of tax reform to the American people. One of the primary reasons I ran for Congress was to have the opportunity to help make major reforms that help American families and that help make our nation more secure, more prosperous and on a path to fiscal stability. Throughout this process our focus has been on lowering rates for taxpayers, making sure American corporations can compete in the world economy, cutting taxes and red tape to promote small business startups and help them grow, and making our tax code simpler and predictable to promote more investment. These are the essentials that will lead to vibrant and sustainable economic growth and that will put more money in people’s paychecks.  While we are excited about what we are doing with this bill, our tax reform effort is not a ‘one and done’. We will continue to work year-after-year to ensure that our tax code works for the American economy and works for all Americans.","link","https://palmer.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-palmer-votes-cut-taxes","palmer.house.gov",173,152,11,11,0,1,3,68

Most Americans connect this uniquely American holiday with a romanticized version of the Pilgrims at Plymouth Colony. But there is more to the story … it is also a story of America’s first experiment with socialism. It is generally known that the Pilgrims settled at Plymouth Colony in December 1620 and suffered terribly through their first winter in America with about half of their members dying from sickness, starvation or exposure. Even though Squanto taught the Pilgrims how to grow corn and members of the Wampanoag tribe helped them with hunting, trapping and fishing, the harvest of their crops yielded barely enough to support the colony. In the fall of 1621, although things were still very tough, they were still thankful for what they had and declared a three-day feast which they shared with about Wampanoag 90 braves who brought deer and wild fowl. The following year, the Pilgrims once again failed to produce enough food to adequately sustain their colony. But it wasn’t bad farming practices that resulted in another poor harvest, it was the colony’s requirement that whatever was produced, whether food or clothing, was to be put in a common storehouse and shared with everyone in the colony. According to the journal kept by William Bradford, the first governor of Plymouth Colony, “… all profits & benefits that are got by trade, working, fishing, or any other means” were to be deposited into a common storehouse and that “all such persons as are of this colony, are to have their meat, drink, apparel, and all provisions out of the common stock.” This meant that each member of the community was entitled to take from the storehouse what they needed, regardless of how much or how little they contributed. The problem, as Bradford found out, was that the Plymouth Colony version of socialism undermined work ethic, killed personal initiative and bred contempt for those who were unwilling to work. Because all that the colonists produced was held in common and all members of the colony were entitled to be provided for from the common storehouse, there was no incentive for people to work any harder than necessary and many able-bodied people simply quit working altogether. After the dismal harvest of 1622, Governor Bradford recorded in his journal that “… they began to think how they might raise as much corn as they could, and obtain a better crop.” He and the other colony leaders observed that the redistributionist system “…was found to breed much confusion and discontent, and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort.” Consequently, Bradford and the Plymouth elders changed the system from the socialist redistribution of the harvest, or as liberals like to call it today—spreading the wealth around—and adopted a free market plan. In their new plan they assigned ownership of a plot of land to each family and allowed them to keep what they produced for themselves or allowed them to sell or trade it. The bountiful harvest of 1623 proved that market incentives work. Bradford wrote, “This had very good success, for it made all hands very industrious, so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been by any other means the Governor or any other could use ….” Bradford acknowledged, “… instead of famine now God gave them plenty and the face of things was changed, to the rejoicing of the hearts of many.” Socialism in Plymouth Colony was a complete and tragic failure. After the colony implemented a free market system, Bradford wrote that from that point “… any general want or famine hath not been amongst them since to this day.” In fact, the harvest of 1624 was so plentiful that colonists were not only able to provide for themselves and others in the colony, they were also able to start exporting corn to England. In other words, the Pilgrims learned that private property and free markets were a benefit to everyone in the colony…the able-bodied and the disabled. When you gather with family and friends this Thanksgiving to give thanks for God’s blessings, you should also give thanks for Governor Bradford and the Pilgrim settlers of Plymouth Colony. They not only laid the spiritual foundation for America, they also laid the foundation for private property and a free market system that has allowed us to care for our families and others in need and that has been a blessing to Americans for over 390 years.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanGaryPalmer/photos/a.577211322409437.1073741828.545855605545009/1124906520973245/?type=3",NA,55,29,10,6,1,0,1,6

In June, 1944, serving as a Forward Artillery Observer with the 377th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion, First Lt. Spruiell exposed himself to enemy fire to locate a working radio in order to call in artillery to suppress and dislodge the enemy from their defensive position. Then, separated from his battalion, he volunteered as an infantryman and led a charge across an open field to take out an enemy machine gun nest. During that action, First Lt. Spruiell was killed.  His actions are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, the 101st Airborne Division, and the Army of the United States. We were truly privileged to have the honor of presenting First Lt. Spruiell's family with the following medals: the American Campaign Medal; the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with Arrowhead Device; one Bronze Service Star, the World War II Victory Medal; the Purple Heart, and the Distinguished Service Cross. Men like First Lt.

Now that the bill has been reported out of committee, I will continue to work for the changes that are necessary to ensure Medicaid is a viable and affordable program to provide healthcare to the people who need it most. In that regard, I believe block granting Medicaid to the states and requiring work for able-bodied working age adults are essential to achieving this objective.

My own hometown of Hackleburg was hit by an EF-5 tornado. When I arrived to see the damage, my heart sank. My hometown was completely and utterly destroyed to the point where familiar places I had grown up seeing were now either gone or unrecognizable. But in Alabama, we don’t let things bring us down for long. Instead we come together and build ourselves and our neighbors back up. On that day and on those days following, the people of Alabama came together helping their loved ones, neighbors and even strangers recover and rebuild their lives. While we remember with great sadness those we lost on April 27th, 2011, we also remember with great pride how people from all over the state of Alabama came together to help each other recover and rebuild.","status",NA,NA,13,4,5,1,0,0,0,0

The amendment that I authored on invisible risk sharing will drive down the cost of health insurance premiums and helps ensure that those with preexisting conditions have affordable coverage. The option for states to choose to receive Medicaid funding as a per-capita cap or a block grant will provide states with more flexibility to meet the needs of their Medicaid eligible people and will reduce the waste of billions of Medicaid dollars to fraud, inefficiencies and mismanagement. The AHCA also gives states the option to establish work requirements for able-bodied adults without small children. Together, these additions to the AHCA are the most substantial entitlement reform in 50 years.  Although states, as they should be, are provided the option to seek waivers from certain federal mandates, states must certify that pursuing a waiver is for the purpose of expanding coverage or reducing the cost of healthcare.  There is no underlying intention to exclude people from coverage, including those who have been previously sick, and it is important to note that this bill will not exclude people from coverage. There is a little known provision in the bill which defunds Planned Parenthood for one year and will protect this lives of the unborn. This bill is not the end of our efforts to dismantle Obamacare and repair the damage done to our healthcare system. It is the first major step forward.","status",NA,NA,116,199,22,15,0,1,4,127
