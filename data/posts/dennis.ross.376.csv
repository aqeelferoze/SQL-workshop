Floridians deserve certainty—both that the federal government will honor its debts, but also that it will manage the federal flood insurance program responsibly. We cannot do either of these things without reform.  I supported this supplemental aid package, but I did so only because House leadership assured me that this will be a down payment on reform. I remain committed to ensuring that Congress institutes the reforms Americans expect and restoring fiscal sanity to the National Flood Insurance Program.  The 353-69 vote approves $18.7 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) disaster relief fund -- including $4.9 billion for a disaster relief loan account -- $16 billion to address national flood insurance program debt and $576.5 for wildfire recovery efforts. It also provided $1.27 billion for disaster food assistance for Puerto Rico. As a member of the House Committee on Financial Services, I've offered legislation that would reform the National Flood Insurance Program and reduce the taxpayer burden for disasters.","status",NA,NA,46,24,1,3,1,1,0,0

I urged the Fish and Wildlife Service to support the request.   Over the course of the past two years, Winter Haven has repeatedly contacted USFWS about its application for an ITP, and had not received an adequate response. The city has acquired all necessary permits involved with the construction of the facility, with the exception of the sand skink’s ITP. Furthermore, the City has completed the bidding process for the project and is ready to award the contract and begin construction--should the City not begin construction within the next three months, one of the contractors will pull out of the contract, placing the entire project in financial jeopardy.  I’m glad that the Fish and Wildlife Service came to understand the importance of this project and that further delays would place it in jeopardy. While I’m continuing to work with USFWS to address other projects in my District, this positive outcome shows that we’re making progress.

The Victims of Communism Caucus is a bipartisan group of Members of Congress dedicated to raising awareness of how communism victimized and enslaved more than 100 million people in the past and how its tyranny in the five existing communist countries (China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, and Vietnam) and its legacy in the post-Soviet sphere shapes international relations today.  We should not be lulled into thinking that communism is no longer a threat to freedom in the world, given that many people still toil under its hateful, totalitarian rule.

This is a meal common among Americans for Thanksgiving. Many of us get to enjoy variations on the same routine: Perhaps a long drive, a football game on television, and a few family members desperate to know how the commute was. Dinner is announced, everyone eats too much, and then someone reaches for the paper to figure out what stores are offering sales worth the hassle. With all this abundance, we know we are blessed.  America has always been a dynamic, changing, and vibrant country, but our traditions remain strong, and we are fortunate to have such a routine. We are the lucky ones that in a world filled with chaos, poverty, and war, we have strong local communities where people come together to help one another. They do so, not because of the government, but because of who we are.   While we have much to be thankful for, many of our neighbors continue to struggle. After a dangerous hurricane season, many have been left displaced or with uncertain futures. But the beauty of America is that we do not forget about those in need. Instead, we get to work. We see it in among our neighbors here at home, where a young boy has inspired his community to support the homeless (http://www.theledger.com/news/20171118/winter-haven-boys-blessing-bags-for-homeless-inspire-others), a local Church plans to give away free Thanksgiving meals (http://www.theledger.com/news/20171119/free-thanksgiving-meals-being-served-wednesday), and our local newspaper continues 49 years of helping neighbors in crisis (http://www.theledger.com/news/20171118/newspaper-with-heart-continues-to-help-neighbors).

Seventy-six years later, we remember when the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service began their descent at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian time. Three hundred and fifty-three imperial Japanese aircraft commenced a surprise attack that left 2,403 Americans dead and 1,178 wounded.    Many Americans knew that someday, staying out of the war would no longer be possible. Then the war came to us.   That day was tragic given the lives lost and the massive toll on our morale. But secretly, we were blessed.   To the Japanese, with so many American battleships sunk or damaged, our Pacific Fleet seemed to be decimated. But things are not always what they seem. When we would eventually win the war, our Pacific Fleet would not rely on the deployment of battleships. The Japanese didn’t know it, but they bombed the wrong ships.   Victory would come because we would rely on the American aircraft carriers and submarines—the very vessels that the Japanese overlooked. We would rely on our logistical superiority, rooted in the untouched repair yards and the oil tank farms. When we fought the Battle of Midway, we didn’t make the same mistake as Imperial Japan. We bombed the right ships. We sank all four of Japan’s large aircraft carriers—the same ones involved in the initial bombing of Pearl Harbor.   This is a very American story: Out of the ashes of defeat, we rise and we fight. And we win.    We remember Pearl Harbor not as a day of tragedy, but as a call to arms.    We must keep this fighting spirit alive in America today. We must always be ready to heed that call.    I’m thankful for our veterans who have set an example, and for our armed forces that continue to make America strong. God bless our nation.

They will be able to keep more of their money and they will have greater opportunities offered by a stronger economy. We’ve simplified the tax code, made it easier to create jobs, and delivered on a promise, with this bill, to make America great again.  Here's what the final bill does:   • Significantly increases the standard deduction to protect roughly double the amount of what you earn each year from taxes – from $6,500 and $13,000 under current law to $12,000 and $24,000 for individuals and married couples, respectively.  • Preserves the mortgage interest deduction – providing tax relief to current and aspiring homeowners.       o For all homeowners with existing mortgages that were taken out to buy a home, there will be no change to the current mortgage interest deduction.      o For homeowners with new mortgages on a first or second home, the home mortgage interest deduction will be available up to $750,000.  • Retains popular retirement savings options such as 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) so Americans can continue to save for their future.  • Expands the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000 for single filers and married couples to help parents with the cost of raising children. The tax credit is fully refundable up to $1,400 and begins to phase-out for families making over $400,000. Parents must provide a child’s valid Social Security Number in order to receive this credit.  • Provides relief for Americans with expensive medical bills by expanding the medical expense deduction for 2017 and 2018 for medical expenses exceeding 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income, and rising to 10 percent beginning in 2019.  • Eliminates Obamacare’s individual mandate penalty tax – providing families with much-needed relief and flexibility to buy the health care that’s right for them if they choose.  • Prevents American jobs, headquarters, and research from moving overseas by eliminating incentives that now reward companies for shifting jobs, profits, and manufacturing plants abroad.  • Provides support for graduate students by continuing to exempt the value of reduced tuition from taxes.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/dennis.ross.376/photos/a.474338745937568.102736.469477579757018/1627013207336777/?type=3",NA,148,202,20,17,3,1,3,81
