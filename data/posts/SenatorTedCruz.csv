And the government of the United States should not be suggesting such a thing. Kerry's speech attempted to lay out an historic and seismic shift toward the delegitimization of our ally Israel. It is a sign of their radicalism and refusal to defend American interests that Obama and Kerry chose to attack the only inclusive democracy in the Middle East, a strong, steadfast ally of America, while simultaneously turning a blind eye to the Islamic terrorism that grows daily.  America's commitment to #Israel must be restored and strengthened. I look forward to taking action with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to repudiate Obama's shameful attack on Israel, to repudiate the United Nations' efforts to undermine Israel and to reaffirm America's strong and unshakable friendship and support for the nation of Israel.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorTedCruz/videos/1096524400459859/",NA,18271,1309,9311,1753,9,67,32,150

So it’s just another extension of their aggressiveness in pursuing these interests. With respect to Cuba, Cuba has always had long standing, very capable intelligence capabilities and I don’t see a reduction in those capabilities.”  We must not stand idly by while our adversaries construct an intelligence apparatus in our backyard that poses a significant threat to U.S. national security. We shall stand resolute in our commitment to deter Russian aggression and prevent their malign influence from metastasizing in foreign countries.","link","https://youtu.be/E849PIO7IcA","youtu.be",711,91,111,27,1,16,3,6

We discussed our mutual opportunity to upgrade the stature of our bilateral relations in a wide-ranging discussion that addressed arms sales, diplomatic exchanges, and economic relations. Furthering economic cooperation between our two nations must be a priority; increased access to Taiwanese markets will benefit Texas farmers, ranchers and small business owners alike.   Shortly before our meeting, the Houston congressional delegation received a curious letter from the Chinese consulate asking members of Congress not to meet with President Tsai, and to uphold the ‘One-China policy’.   The People’s Republic of China needs to understand that in America we make decisions about meeting with visitors for ourselves. This is not about the PRC.  This is about the U.S. relationship with Taiwan, an ally we are legally bound to defend.  The Chinese do not give us veto power over those with whom they meet. We will continue to meet with anyone, including the Taiwanese, as we see fit.  The US-Taiwan relationship is not on the negotiating table. It is bound in statute and founded on common interests. I look forward to working with President Tsai to strengthen our partnership.","link","https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=2951","cruz.senate.gov",3253,176,384,222,9,28,1,7

Exercising our constitutional authority, we advised President Obama that we would not consent to a Supreme Court nominee until We the People, in the presidential election, were able to choose between an originalist and a progressive vision of the Constitution.   In November, the People spoke, clearly. They elected President Donald Trump, who had repeatedly promised to nominate a justice firmly committed to following the law and the original understanding of the Constitution. Today, with the nomination of the Honorable Neil Gorsuch from the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, President Trump has fulfilled that promise, and the rule of law will be all the better for it.    Like the renowned justice he is set to replace, Judge Gorsuch is brilliant and immensely talented. He has impeccable qualifications, having clerked at the Supreme Court, excelled in private practice, served at the highest levels of the Justice Department, and garnered a stellar reputation over the past decade as an appellate judge. More importantly, though, he also mirrors Justice Scalia in that he has a proven track record of honoring the Constitution, following the text of the law, and refraining from imposing his policy preferences from the bench. As a result of his fidelity to law, he has proven to be a champion of federalism, the constitutional separation of powers, religious liberty, and all of the fundamental liberties enshrined in our Bill of Rights. I couldn’t be happier with his selection.   Indeed, I wholeheartedly applaud President Trump for nominating Judge Gorsuch. Our country desperately needs Supreme Court justices who revere the Constitution and are willing to elevate it over their own personal preferences, and Judge Gorsuch has demonstrated that faithfulness. Eleven years ago, the Senate was so confident in Judge Gorsuch’s abilities that it confirmed him by voice vote. In the time since, he has shown himself worthy of that distinction, and I would hope that my Senate colleagues give him the respect he deserves this time around, as well, and support his confirmation.","status",NA,NA,11041,1333,1445,1313,16,15,16,462

We need judges who understand this distinction, who do not think that when you put on a robe, you suddenly get to enact whatever policies or laws you might personally favor.

I've known Alex for over twenty years; he and I went to law school together, and he's a smart, principled conservative with a passion for justice.  His record of service, inclusion, and accomplishment spans decades.  Alex has served as a law clerk to Justice Samuel Alito, as a Board Member on the National Labor Relations Board, as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and most recently as a pioneering law-school dean.   His nomination to the Labor Department is great news for workers and for job creation in our country.  Overreaching regulations for the past eight years have reduced opportunities for work and deprived hardworking Americans of increases in their wages.

For eight long years the Obama administration remained willfully blind to the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, admitting tens of thousands of refugees whom the FBI expressly told Congress they could not be certain were not terrorists. That Obama policy made no sense, and it made America less safe. If we are serious about combating the threat of radical Islam, we must reform and strengthen our refugee programs to ensure proper vetting of those entering our country—especially when they are coming from nations that are hotbeds of terror. This is crucial to our national security and to protecting American lives, and it is a priority for which I have long advocated.   I commend President Trump for rejecting Obama's willful blindness. In contrast to the hysteria and mistruths that are still being pushed by the media, President Trump’s executive order implements a four-month pause in refugee admissions so that stronger vetting procedures can be put in place. This is a commonsense step that the American people overwhelmingly support. I am also pleased to see that lawful permanent residents will not be impacted by this order.   I will continue to call on Congress to pass legislation to further assist in these efforts.  For example, the executive order calls for greater influence from the states in this process, and the State Refugee Security Act that I introduced with Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) would do just that. This is a commonsense step to help keep us safe, and should be something that all senators and representatives, regardless of political party, can unite behind.","link","https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=3025","cruz.senate.gov",3748,560,520,315,11,10,8,268

His leadership will bring exceptional moral clarity to such an important position during a pivotal time of immense and growing instability in the Middle East.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and the brave law enforcement members who brought the terrorist down – particularly with the family of Kurt Cochran, a fellow American from Utah who was killed, and his wife, Melissa, who was seriously injured. The British people and the British government should know that America stands shoulder to shoulder with them.   Just today, a man in the Belgian port city of Antwerp was arrested after driving his car at high speed through a busy pedestrian shopping street. Fortunately, there are no reports of injuries, despite police reportedly having found rifles, knives and a gas can in his car. Had local authorities not acted swiftly and decisively to stop the suspected attacker, countless innocent people could have been killed or injured.   It is past time for us to get serious, smart, and decisive in dealing with the global threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Fortunately, we no longer have an administration in the White House that refuses to call these terrorists by their name and make clear that, rather than acting in the name of an amorphous violent extremism, they are setting off bombs, stabbing people with knives, shooting people in cafes and concert halls and running people down on promenades and shopping streets in the name of their Islamist ideology.   This is why I reintroduced the Expatriate Terrorist Act last month, so that American citizens who join foreign terrorist organizations like ISIS and commit acts of terror against the United States forfeit their citizenship. I have also supported the Trump administration’s executive order to suspend immigration from at risk countries until we have an improved vetting system in place to check for Islamist terrorists attempting to enter the United States. We know that ISIS is using migrant routes to smuggle its fighters into Europe and the United States. What is equally disturbing from the murderous attack in London is that the terrorist appears to have been a homegrown jihadist who was known to authorities. Beyond executing a strategy to utterly destroy ISIS and closing pathways for Islamist terrorists to enter our free societies, we need a comprehensive, bold and effective strategy to address radicalism here at home and I am committed to working with my colleagues and the administration to continue making this a priority.","status",NA,NA,1590,205,209,38,1,4,186,91

Excessive regulations like these, that pick winners and losers and force Americans to use certain types of energy, harm job creation and slow economic growth.  All of us want clean water and clean air, but we shouldn’t have to choose between a clean environment and a healthy, growing economy. The previous administration’s effort to regulate our energy sector by executive fiat should be a lesson that regulations that impact the lives of every American should be approved by Congress, not imposed by the unelected bureaucracy. In fact, Congress should return much of the environmental rulemaking and regulation to the states, whose regulators are closer to the people and have a better understanding of their own state’s economy and environmental conditions.   Over the last eight years, regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions cost more than $457 billion, which is more than $3,350 per household.

What we saw is the modern Democratic party opposed to Donald Trump appointing anyone. If they will filibuster Neil Gorsuch, they will filibuster any nominee. If the Democrats persist in this foolish filibuster, the Senate majority will have no choice but return to the standard that has prevailed for over two centuries in the Senate, which is confirming Supreme Court justices by a majority vote.

Ten, 20, 30 years from now, this vote will still be having an ongoing impact on the liberty and constitutional rights of millions of Americans.   Today, the Senate followed through on a promise made to the American people more than a year ago, after Justice Scalia passed away. Justice Scalia was a lion of the law, and a hero to many. His death transformed November’s election into a referendum on the Supreme Court.  President Trump promised to nominate a principled jurist in the mold of Justice Scalia, not a liberal judicial activist who would undermine the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. And in November, millions of conservatives across this country showed up to protect the Constitution and protect that vacant seat for a principled originalist. Despite an unprecedented Democratic filibuster, today is a day that the Republican majority kept its promise to protect our fundamental rights, to protect free speech, to protect religious liberty, and to protect the Second Amendment. Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation is a critical step to defend the long-term liberty of millions of Americans, and for that reason, today is a day to celebrate.","link","https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=3088","cruz.senate.gov",7533,776,520,1102,15,8,23,559

I applaud the State Department and thank President Trump for his leadership in securing Sandy's release.  It should be noted that Sandy's purpose in visiting China two years ago was to strengthen commercial and cultural exchanges on behalf of the city of Houston.

Sandy was unjustly deprived of her liberty for two years, time during which she was denied basic legal protections and her loved ones lacked accurate information about her condition.

These are common sense measures I have supported in the past, particularly authoring legislation with Sen. Rubio to prohibit financial transactions with Cuba’s military-controlled entities. President Obama’s normalization policy with Communist Cuba has fundamentally undermined U.S. interests and strengthened the Castros’ control over the island. As a result, American dollars are directly funneled to the Cuban military which sustains the regime’s brutal activities. There has been no corresponding political liberation with the ease of travel and trade restrictions, only increased oppression, imprisonments, and torture.  I commend President Trump for a positive step toward cutting off U.S. funds from going to the Cuban military. This is not an abstract issue to me. It is a personal one. My father and my aunt both were imprisoned and tortured in Cuba – one by Batista, one by Castro. They’ve seen firsthand the oppression that the Cuban government produces and they both fled to Texas seeking freedom.  America should not be subsidizing the machinery of this communist government which has been exporting terror throughout Latin America for decades. Instead, we should be using American policy to encourage genuine democratic reforms and leadership in Cuba. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration to protect and enhance freedom for the Cuban people. http://bit.ly/2sHzbqU","link","http://bit.ly/2sHzbqU","bit.ly",4913,606,568,403,25,15,13,394

Over time, this group expanded to include committee chairs, Senate leadership, and then the entire conference. We carefully deliberated, with the common goal of crafting a bill that can pass and that actually fixes the problems Obamacare has wrought.  While I have not yet had the opportunity to fully review the draft legislative text itself, there are components that give me encouragement and there are also components that are a cause for deep concern.  I am encouraged that the bill would expand association health plans, so those in individual or small group markets can join together in large groups to get lower rates. I am also pleased that the bill would make at least some progress in reining in the long-term growth of Medicaid. These are two inclusions that I have been fighting for since the beginning of our discussions. Finally, I am glad that this retains the provisions previously passed by Congress to prevent taxpayer dollars from funding organizations that perform abortions.  However, as currently drafted, this bill draft does not do nearly enough to lower premiums. That should be the central issue for Republicans - repealing Obamacare and making healthcare more affordable. Because of this, I cannot support it as currently drafted, and I do not believe it has the votes to pass the Senate.  But it is important to remember that what was released today was only a draft. I am hopeful that as we openly debate this legislation, real improvements will be made prior to floor consideration so that we can pass a bill that provides the relief from Obamacare that Republicans have repeatedly promised the last seven years.  Specifically, we should do more to ensure consumers have the freedom to choose among more affordable plans that are tailored for their individual healthcare needs. We should allow consumers to purchase insurance across state lines and create a true 50-state marketplace, driving down costs for everyone. We should expand health savings accounts so that consumers can pay health insurance premiums on a pre-tax basis. We should incentivize states to cap punitive damages in medical malpractice lawsuits to further reduce the cost of healthcare.  Finally, we should provide real flexibility for Medicaid, so states can design creative and innovative ways to provide care for our most vulnerable. I have strongly advocated for these proposals to this point and will continue to do so going forward.  I want to get to yes, but this first draft doesn't get the job done. Over the next week and beyond, I will continue working to bring Republicans together to honor our promise, repeal Obamacare, and adopt common-sense, consensus reforms that can actually be passed into law.  http://bit.ly/2s0qdjQ","link","http://bit.ly/2s0qdjQ","bit.ly",4622,2266,929,429,18,24,23,603

I always appreciate the opportunity to visit the Rio Grande Valley, and meet with the dedicated community members and leaders in the region. As I travel across the state this week, from McAllen to McKinney, San Antonio to Austin, I look forward to hearing the concerns and ideas of Texans, so we can create more good-paying jobs and expand opportunity across the Lone Star State.  http://bit.ly/2uHsqCB","link","http://bit.ly/2uHsqCB","bit.ly",2750,332,140,276,27,8,3,94

While in Military City, USA, I appeared on several other Texas radio shows, including 660 AM The Answer’s The Wells Report, and Mike Gallagher show, where I discussed many issues Texans hold dear, including my work on behalf of veterans, the 2018 NDAA bill, and health care reform.   We all know the last several years the scandals we’ve seen in the VA. We’ve seen the VA wrongfully denying care to veterans. We’ve seen some VA institutions keeping fake and bogus books, phantom books and hiding that Veterans were being denied lifesaving treatment that they had earned and were entitled too. So I have been pressing hard to reform the VA. One piece of it is accountability. Ensuring that those, who lie, who broke the law, are held accountable and I’ve helped pass legislation to do exactly that. Another piece of it, you just referenced, is on the IT side. Ensuring that the way records are kept in the VA is unified, its’s simplified, that you can’t hide, you can’t keep the books, but instead that everything is transparent so that we know exactly if veterans are being denied care so we can act to impose accountability and fix the problem.  The biggest reform we can do for veterans is to expand choice. You know today I met with a number of veterans leaders here in north Texas, we did a round table. And there was widespread agreement that expanding the choice program is the most significant thing you can do to improve the VA system. I think every veteran has the right to go to the doctor of your choice. If you want to go to the VA you have earned that you have bled for it, but if you want to go to the  local doctor, you want to go to the cardiologist down the street, you ought be able to do that and competition improves the VA.  http://bit.ly/2tm7CCR","link","http://bit.ly/2tm7CCR","bit.ly",525,123,43,55,7,0,1,49

The Iranian regime must be held firmly accountable after the last eight years in which the U.S. policy towards Iran was based on weakness and appeasement.

Liu Xiaobo, a voice for the voiceless and defender of the oppressed in Communist China, passed away. Although the physical cause of his death was cancer, Dr. Liu’s primary battle was one of the soul. Ever since leaving the safety and comfort of America to lead the protests at Tiananmen Square in 1989, Dr. Liu sealed his fate as a persistent focus of persecution from the authoritarian PRC. From ‘reeducation through labor’ and deprivation of property to unjust imprisonment and physical abuse, Dr. Liu bore the brunt of the Communist Party’s wrath for daring to challenge their immoral system of political oppression in his coauthoring of ‘Charter 08,’ a manifesto of Chinese freedom that reverberates today more than ever.   As we grieve his loss, our immediate focus must be his widow Liu Xia. Because Xi Jinping refused their departure to America, their rightfully earned Nobel Prize money remains unclaimed, and Liu Xia is in danger. Although it is of no consolation regarding the death of her husband, I was pleased to hear today from Liu Xiaobo’s counsel that the Norwegian Nobel Institute has now confirmed it has found a legal way for Liu Xia to be able to inherit the $1.5 million monetary award for the Nobel Peace Prize that Liu Xiaobo was never able to collect. I intend to continue my longstanding effort to honor Liu Xiaobo and to secure Liu Xia’s livelihood, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Republican and Democrat: if there is an issue that should unite us all, it is that the wife a Nobel Peace laureate speaking out for peace and democracy should not be kept hostage in Communist China.  https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=3237","link","https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=3237","cruz.senate.gov",879,195,159,25,4,2,395,30

That should cause all of us great concern, and both Congress and the administration should be doing everything possible to secure Wang's release and that of other American citizens unjustly detained.   The Obama Iran Deal is wholly inadequate and paves the way for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. The inspection regime is designed to facilitate cheating by requiring effectively three weeks advance notice, and by limiting the most sensitive sites to inspection solely by the Iranians. In the 1990s, the American people received numerous assurances that North Korea would abide by a very similar agreement. Kim Jong-Il happily took the billions of dollars that previous administrations sent, and have used those funds to develop nuclear weapons. I believe the Ayatollah Khamenei intends to do the exact same thing.  There is no greater threat on the face of the earth to the United States than that of a nuclear Iran. This week's certification was unfortunate and dangerous, and very hard to justify with the facts on the ground. There is another certification that is due in October, and another upcoming deadline for waiving sanctions. I look forward to receiving a full briefing from the administration on the abundant evidence of Iranian non-compliance, stringent measures to correct those violations, and ways to secure the rapid release of Americans unjustly held in Iran.  http://bit.ly/2troV7p","link","http://bit.ly/2troV7p","bit.ly",562,144,101,22,6,15,12,122

Oswaldo was a leader to the resistance movement against Castro, and served as a threat to the despicable and tyrannical ways of the Castro regime. On this day in 2012, the Cuban government reported Oswaldo dead after a suspicious car accident which the Cuban government reported as his cause of death. To this day, family members believe that the car Oswaldo was riding in was targeted for an intended car crash. This past March, I had the honor to introduce legislation to commemorate Oswaldo’s legacy by naming the street in front of the Cuban Embassy in Washington, D.C., as “Oswaldo Paya Way” to send a powerful statement to Raul Castro that here in the United States of America, we stand with freedom fighters like Oswaldo, who have devoted their lives towards making a better Cuba, free of communist rule.   For years the Castro regime has unjustly detained and tortured many innocent people in Cuba. In spite of the fear Castro and his cronies have wrought among the streets with, Oswaldo was a beacon of hope, providing strength to the resistance against human rights violators like Che Guevara and Fidel Castro. The plights of the good people of Cuba are marked by an atrocious record of suffering under both the Castro regime, and the brutal dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista before it.    Despite the malice of the likes of Batista, Castro, and Guevara, it did not break the will of the brave Cuban people. Rather, it made them stronger, and further united them to fight for freedom and build a better future for their country -- to establish another Cuba, one not characterized by the ashes of dissident literature or the corpses of defenseless teenagers, but a Cuba that believes in human decency and individual liberty -- where dissidents are heard and not killed, and speech is protected, not silenced. It is the Cuba for which Oswaldo yearned for, dedicating his life to promoting democratic freedoms and human rights in Cuba. He is legacy will never be forgotten, and continues to inspire dissidents to this day–in Cuba and in other countries under tyrannical rule, including Venezuela, where Nicholas Maduro routinely imprisons and murders those who dare speak against him. We will never forget Oswaldo Paya.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorTedCruz/photos/a.317349068377400.67209.315496455229328/1293606897418274/?type=3",NA,866,136,121,40,7,6,120,11

Oswaldo fue un líder al movimiento de la resistencia contra Castro y sirvió como una amenaza al régimen malvado y tiránico de Castro. Hace cinco años, el gobierno cubano reportó que Oswaldo murió tras un sospechoso accidente automovilístico que el gobierno cubano informo como su causa de muerte. Hasta el día de hoy, miembros de la familia creen que el vehículo en el que viajaba Oswaldo estaba destinado a un accidente de coche.  En Marzo, tuve el honor de introducir una legislación para conmemorar el legado de Oswaldo la cual nombraría la calle en frente de la Embajada de Cuba “Oswaldo Paya Way” y mandaría una fuerte declaración a Raul Castro que en los Estados Unidos de América, estamos con los luchadores por la libertad como Oswaldo, que han dedicado sus vidas a liberar a Cuba del régimen comunista.  Por muchos años el régimen de Castro ha injustamente perseguido y torturado a muchas personas inocentes en Cuba. A pesar del temor que Castro y sus cómplices han forjado en las calles, Oswaldo fue un faro de esperanza, proporcionando fuerza a la resistencia contra los violadores de los derechos humanos como el Che Guevara y Fidel Castro. La difícil situación de la buena gente de Cuba esta marcada por un atroz record de sufrimiento tanto bajo el régimen de Castro y la brutal dictadura de Fulgencio Batista.  A pesar de la malicia de gente como Batista, Castro y Guevara, esto no ha roto la voluntad del valiente pueblo cubano. Al contrario, los hizo más fuerte y los unió para luchar por la libertad y construir un futuro mejor para su país—un país no caracterizado por las cenizas de la literatura disidente o los cadáveres de indefensos adolescentes, pero una Cuba que cree en la decencia humana y la libertad individual-donde los disidentes son escuchados y no asesinados, y donde la libertad de expresión es protegida, no silenciada. Es la Cuba que Oswaldo anhelaba, dedicando su vida a la promoción de las libertades democráticas y los derechos humanos. Hasta el día de hoy, su legado sigue inspirando a los disidentes-en Cuba y en otros países bajo gobiernos tiránicos; incluyendo a Venezuela, donde Nicholas Maduro rutinariamente encarcela y asesina aquellos que se atreven hablar contra él. Nunca olvidáramos a Oswaldo Paya.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorTedCruz/photos/a.317349068377400.67209.315496455229328/1293669724078658/?type=3",NA,443,151,70,24,5,5,70,7

Under Obamacare, too many of our friends, neighbors, and family members have seen their premiums and deductibles dramatically rise by more than $5,000 per year while they simultaneously lost access to the doctors and the plans they liked. Now is the time to prove that our rhetoric of the past seven years regarding the repeal and replacement of this disastrous bill will lead to substantive action. I intend to support the motion to proceed in order to begin this process.  Although it is unclear exactly which legislative solutions will carry the day, of the various approaches that have been discussed, there are two that I can support. The first is to take up the Senate’s 2015 Obamacare repeal bill and pass it. This would allow us to begin to immediately curtail the damage of Obamacare and give us two years to formulate a replacement plan that lowers premiums and once again gives Americans access to quality healthcare.  The second approach is to adopt the Better Care Reconciliation Act, which includes my Consumer Freedom amendment, and also a provision to let Americans use pre-tax dollars in their health savings accounts (HSAs) to pay for premiums. A recent study released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services demonstrates that the Consumer Freedom amendment would result in 2.2 million more people obtaining insurance and reduce premiums by more than $7,000 per year. Consumer Freedom not only expands coverage and has a dramatic impact on premiums, but it also once again gives Americans the freedom to decide which healthcare plan is best for them.   The Senate must now vote to begin debate on solutions that will undo the damage of Obamacare. Once it does, enacting either of these options – the 2015 repeal bill or the Better Care Reconciliation Act with Consumer Freedom and the ability to use HSAs to pay premiums – will be critical to earning my support.","link","http://bit.ly/2vDfsY6","bit.ly",5948,2613,621,377,41,10,24,849

I am especially pleased that this bill requires the State Department to determine whether North Korea should be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, incorporating the operative language that I introduced in S. 672. It was a mistake for North Korea to be removed from the list of state sponsors nine years ago, and the rogue regime in Pyongyang has only grown more hostile toward America and our allies, more engaged in illicit proliferation around the world, and more committed to destabilizing the Asia-Pacific region ever since.   I’m also glad that this bill sanctions Iran and Russia. Specifically, it targets Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for its involvement in international terrorism and for shepherding the regime’s ballistic missile program, and Iran’s non-nuclear activities which continue to make the Tehran regime among the most dangerous in the world. It holds Russia accountable for its hostile actions in Syria, invading and illegally annexing Crimea, engaging in cyber-attacks, and destabilizing activities around the world, while reducing the ability of Vladimir Putin and his regime to opportunistically deprive American energy companies of prospective business opportunities.  http://bit.ly/2v47qJS","link","http://bit.ly/2v47qJS","bit.ly",908,245,82,39,12,7,1,47

Maduro’s electoral commission lied about election turnout and downplayed the overwhelming number of government employees who were pressured to participate. To add insult to injury, Maduro has called on the newly-elected sham Constituent Assembly to occupy the same premises as the duly elected National Assembly, and pressured the Venezuelan opposition to meekly accept his full-throated assault on Venezuela’s Constitution, its democratic values, and the rule of law.

This legislation is particularly important to the state of Texas, not only because of the challenges we’ve long faced in combatting human trafficking, but also because of this bill’s specific targeting of a Dallas-based internet hosting company – Backpage – that knowingly allowed trafficking operations to utilize their website.   Two years ago, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) initiated an inquiry on Backpage’s suspicious business practices. For years prior, the U.S. Senate had been investigating the company due to complaints of questionable advertisements promoted in their “adult” section, and a reported longtime affiliation and involvement with existing investigations conducted by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Multiple victims of prior underage trafficking cases identified Backpage as an originating source for their pimps to advertise their services; resulting in profit not only for their captors but also the owners of the website.   Backpage defended its operations with the excuse that under federal law, internet hosting companies could not be held responsible for content posted to their websites by users. They also claimed to have a specialized in-house team dedicated to monitoring the posted screen ads to prevent cases of underage trafficking. However, after heart wrenching testimonies from victims and a thorough investigation, Backpage was found to have knowingly facilitated criminal sex trafficking, in most cases involving vulnerable women and young girls. It was a company right in our backyard which for years enabled the heinous industry of sex and human trafficking.   It is truly disturbing that loopholes exist to allow this type of activity in our beloved state. In January, the University of Texas’ Institute on Domestic Violence and Sexual reported that there were an estimated 300,000 victims of human trafficking in Texas alone. Of that 79,000 were minors.   This is why the Stop Human Trafficking Now Act is so important. No longer do online companies have an excuse to sit on the sidelines while illicit trafficking rings use their websites to victimize vulnerable people, particularly women and children. Now is the time to close those loopholes and establish a mechanism for law enforcement to go after any entity that would perpetuate the scour of human and sex trafficking in Texas.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorTedCruz/photos/a.317349068377400.67209.315496455229328/1304697932975837/?type=3",NA,1317,156,299,80,4,3,22,15

As the Supreme Court explained in Crawford v Marion County, ‘flagrant examples of [voter] fraud . . . have been documented throughout this Nation’s history by respected historians and journalists [and] demonstrate that not only is the risk of voter fraud real but that it could affect the outcome of a close election.’ Voter fraud diminishes confidence in our democratic process, and minority voters are far too frequently the victims of that fraud. The Voter ID law is a commonsense protection to safeguard the rights of every Texan and to prevent illegal voter fraud. The district judge's opinion to the contrary violates Supreme Court precedent, and I trust that the Fifth Circuit will reverse it on appeal. http://bit.ly/2w1TAYy","link","http://bit.ly/2w1TAYy","bit.ly",3531,1594,610,74,292,77,152,1158

I spent this morning at the shelter at the George Brown Convention Center helping serve breakfast, helping care for people there. We had 11,000 people who had lost their homes who spent the night there last night. We are seeing churches and charities and private citizens throughout the community stepping up. It has been incredible, the most incredible part: local officials put out a call to citizens, ‘If you can help, step up and help.’ And we have hundreds of ordinary men and women who had a flat bottom boat, who had a bass boat, who had a jet ski and went out and rescued their fellow citizens. A couple of days ago I was at the Harris County Emergency Command Center.

Working closely with Senator John Cornyn and the entire Texas delegation, we were able to add another $7.4 billion in relief, increasing the total funds potentially available to Texas to $15.25 billion.  These funds are immediate, properly targeted to the areas hit by the storm, and focused on clean-up and rebuilding. This will not be nearly enough to cover all the costs—most estimates of total damage are well in excess of $100 billion—but it is a significant first step. And Congress is committed to meeting the additional need as it is accurately quantified in the months ahead.  It is unfortunate that congressional leadership and the Administration chose to tie Harvey relief to short-term extensions to the CR and the debt ceiling. Historically, the CR and debt ceiling have proven to be the only effective leverage for meaningful spending reform, and I believe we should continue to use them as tools to reduce our long-term debt. I would have much preferred a clean Harvey relief bill—which would have passed both Houses nearly unanimously.  http://bit.ly/2gKq8NN","link","http://bit.ly/2gKq8NN","bit.ly",1050,241,87,102,6,6,3,27

By securing and initial down payment of emergency funds here on the ground, our local leaders, our city leaders, our county leaders, our law enforcement have the resources to begin the rebuilding process. I’m very glad to see my colleagues come together in Congress to provide this relief. It was important, and a lot more is on the way.  https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=3347","link","https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=3347","cruz.senate.gov",797,80,54,85,16,0,1,5

You ought to be able to fill out your taxes on a postcard. The nine billion hours a year we spend in tax compliance – that’s wasted.   It is important, I believe that Congress pass a tax cut, not just tax reform. We need to cut taxes on individuals, on families, on small businesses, that’s how we’re going to create jobs. And the only way to do that is to say this is not going to be revenue neutral, this is a tax cut, because our priority is jobs.   We care about jobs here in America. Main street jobs. Manufacturing jobs. Union jobs. Blue collar jobs. We need a big tax cut on you, on families who are struggling, on small businesses. We need a Reaganesque tax cut that unleashes incredible growth.

Led by heroes like Joshua Wong, Alex Chow, and Nathan Law, what began as a small gathering of roughly 100 students grew exponentially to 100,000 men and women peacefully demanding the freedom to choose their elected representatives. In the absence of support, however, this “Umbrella Revolution” was no match for Beijing’s determination to avoid a reprise of Tiananmen Square. Ever since the conclusion of these demonstrations in December 2014, the totalitarian grip of China has tightened on this nominally autonomous region. From kidnapping and torturing booksellers to reinterpreting the Basic Law to barring newly elected representatives favoring independence from assuming office, China’s pernicious control over Hong Kong’s government has gone so far as to affect the imprisonment of Wong, Chow, and Law.

The Palestinians have been seeking membership and recognition in international bodies despite the reality there is no Palestinian state. This bid for membership is part of an effort to further the PA’s diplomatic and legal warfare campaign to delegitimize Israel in international forums, and I am concerned that the PA will now try to take advantage of its membership by seeking illegitimate and unjustified Interpol actions against Israeli citizens.   Interpol is the world’s largest international organization of law enforcement agencies that assists countries in the fight against crime. By permitting the Palestinians to join, Interpol has undermined its own credibility. The PA not only fails to even condemn acts of terrorism, it incites and glorifies violence continuing to provide monthly salaries to terrorists and to the families of those who died committing terrorism. Interpol has unfortunately now provided faux legitimacy and become complicit in this political campaign against Israel.   It is long-standing policy of the United States to oppose the PA’s attempts to unilaterally become a member of international organizations. Despite today’s outcome, I commend the Trump Administration for its efforts to thwart this decision working alongside Israel.  http://bit.ly/2k4RhQs","link","http://bit.ly/2k4RhQs","bit.ly",731,198,207,28,10,36,24,185

Eliminating this tax will help prevent financial hardships imposed by this inflated tax on individuals. ·         According to the Tax Foundation, repeal of the death tax will result in an estimated 2.3 percent increase in capital invested in the U.S. economy, ultimately boosting productivity 0.7 percent resulting in increased labor force participation by the equivalent of 159,000 full-time jobs. Tax reform proposals eliminating the death tax anticipate over a 10-year time span $28 billion total revenue increase for small businesses. ·         The death tax is double taxation. The descendant paid taxes on this income over the course of his or her lifetime, and death should not be a valid excuse to tax the same money again.  ·         More than 99 percent of U.S. employer firms are small businesses, many of them family-owned. The death tax establishes a burden that prevents families from being able to keep their businesses running from one generation to the next, and should be put to an end. ·         Even businesses that do not end up owing the death tax have to spend their limited time and resources to plan to ensure their businesses can endure from one generation to the next. ·         The idea of looking at a single year for the estate tax does not adequately portray the impact of the tax since it is only on deceased individuals. Between 1995-2016 a total of 102,000 closely held businesses (sole proprietorships, partnerships, S-Corps, and closely held C-Corps) and 36,000 farms paid the estate tax. ·         On the farm side, according to USDA Agriculture Census, there were 3.2 million farmers in 2012, with a total US population of 314 million, making farmers equal to just over one percent of the population. However, 13 percent of estates subject to the estate tax included farms. The average age of farmers is also increasing, one third of all farmers are over age 65, and 62 percent are over age 55. As our farming generation grows older the number of farmers paying the estate tax will continue to dramatically rise.   https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=3433","link","https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=3433","cruz.senate.gov",1628,583,359,44,64,28,11,154

They have demonstrated considerable gallantry in the face of the Islamic State and have more than earned our continued support. Such hostile actions pose a grave threat to the safety of our allies and the stability of the counter-ISIS mission at large. We must not permit our support or our military equipment to be used by Iranian-backed militias toward a new, ill-conceived operation that is counter to U.S. interests.  Iran’s dangerous influence is far reaching, only emboldened with billions of dollars in sanctions relief after the catastrophic nuclear deal. The events of the past week in Kirkuk are yet another indication of their ambitious efforts to reshape and influence the Middle East.  Further, the Iraqi Kurds, who have been instrumental in deterring ISIS, have expressed their clear desire for independence. Democracies across the globe should recognize the efforts made by the Kurdistan Regional Government to achieve self-determination, in the face of regional actors threatening their very livelihood.  Should the Government of Iraq continue down this path and effectively act as a puppet of Iran, it would require a reevaluation of U.S. support to the country.  http://bit.ly/2ytBnVD","link","http://bit.ly/2ytBnVD","bit.ly",619,143,153,48,5,2,4,24

It was just a few days ago that Lebanon's President Aoun yet again threatened Israel, saying, ‘All the Lebanese are prepared to fight against Israel.’ While the gains from our current policy in the fight against ISIS are significant, the reality of Iran's efforts to fill this vacuum, further entrench itself in Lebanon, and establish a military presence in Syria and a ‘Shia Crescent’ through Iraq cannot be permitted.

And I believe we will get it done. We will see the House come together, the Senate come together to deliver results on this. Tax reform should follow three critical goals. Number one, front and center, jobs and economic growth. This should be all about jobs, jobs, jobs. More jobs, higher wage paying jobs, more opportunity for Americans working to achieve the American dream.   Number two is simplicity. The more simplicity, the better. There is power in bold simplicity. And number three is fairness. We should be treating the American people fairly, not picking winners and losers in Washington.   I will say that one of the tasks going forward, as in the House and in the Senate – I think we need to do even more to provide a tax cut – not just tax reforms – but a tax cut to every American. To working men and women. I think there is a path forward that actually the president laid out last week, which is repealing the individual mandate, the IRS tax from Obamacare. The IRS tax, the individual mandate from Obamacare is profoundly unfair. Each year, the IRS fines about 6 million people because they don’t have enough money to afford health care. Roughly 80 percent of the people getting fined by the IRS make $50,000 a year or less. Roughly 40 percent make $25,000 a year or less.   In my home state of Texas, you’ve got about a million people a year getting fined by the IRS. So here’s their situation, you’ve got a single mom, whose working, trying to make ends meet. She doesn’t have enough money to purchase health insurance because Obamacare has driven health insurance through the roof, and on top of that the IRS fines her because she doesn’t have enough money to purchase health insurance. That is profoundly unfair. We need to repeal that.   It’s good policy, but here’s the particular silver lining for tax reform. The Congressional Budget Office scores that repeal as saving over $400 billion all of which I believe should be put directly into lowering tax rates on individuals. This draft does a good job on the corporate and business side, we need to do every bit as good a job on the individual side. Lowering rates, so that every American - so that if you’re a single mom waiting tables, you get a tax cut. If you’re a school teacher in upstate New York, you get a tax cut. If you’re a farmer in Iowa or Nebraska, you get a tax cut. If you’re a refinery worker in Southeast Texas, you get a tax cut. Every American, every family, every individual sees a real tax cut to make it easier to provide for your needs. If we do that, it’ll produce jobs, it’ll produce economic growth, and it’ll produce fairness for every American. That’s our objective, and I believe we’re going to get it done.  http://bit.ly/2yGbl2n","link","http://bit.ly/2yGbl2n","bit.ly",1870,1131,187,120,29,9,5,329

This Veterans Day, Heidi and I are proud to recognize the incredible bravery and sacrifice of all those who have served, and continue to serve in our Armed Forces to protect our nation, defend our Constitution, and defeat our adversaries. We owe them a debt we can never fully repay.  In the wake of Hurricane Harvey, it was remarkable to me the number of active duty, reservists, national guardsmen and veterans I encountered at nearly every storm shelter, volunteer center, distribution line, and devastated home I visited. They have been a crucial force in clean up and recovery efforts all along our coast, from rescue and recovery operations, to rebuilding homes, schools, and churches. Their leadership and service in Texas' time of need is a reminder of the ongoing contributions our service members and veterans make to our communities years after their selfless service to our nation.  It is this same spirit of service and sacrifice that ensures America remains a shining city on a hill, the land of the free and the home of the brave. I hope all Texans join us today in honoring and thanking the 1.6 million veterans who call Texas home.  http://bit.ly/2zByBM8","link","http://bit.ly/2zByBM8","bit.ly",1386,156,117,183,8,0,1,4

This bill significantly lowers our corporate tax rate – currently the highest in the developed world – which will bring needed jobs back to America and up to $2.9 trillion in capital back to our economy. Most importantly, this legislation brings relief to working families, doubling the child tax credit and providing rate cuts for individual taxpayers in all brackets.  I am particularly proud of three specific items that I fought aggressively to include. First, repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate. Not only does this bring immediate and significant relief to 6.5 million Americans unfairly fined each year by the IRS for not being able to afford health insurance, but it also provides for $338 billion over ten years to go toward even more individual tax relief. That is a huge victory for working Americans that allows us to set the stage to repeal Obamacare next year. Second, mitigating the effect of eliminating the State and Local Tax (SALT) property tax deduction by allowing people to deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes. While ideally this bill would have cut rates enough to allow for full repeal of SALT deductibility, that is not the case, and therefore to prevent raising taxes on Americans in high-tax cities and states, it was crucial that the deduction for up to $10,000 in property taxes was included. Third, we were able to avoid a proposed and terribly misguided $350-500 billion tax hike that was being proposed in the final hours of debate that would have all but nullified much of the tax relief intended for working Americans.  The bill also moves the ball forward on several key priorities I have pushed for throughout this legislative effort. While there are other provisions for which I advocated that I would have liked to see included – specifically more rate cuts and consolidation of the brackets on the individual side, a complete end to the death tax, and full repeal of the AMT – the result of what passed the Senate today will improve outcomes for American people and American job creators. I will continue working to fight for 28 million Texans and all Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money and spend it as they wish, not as the federal government wishes.  http://bit.ly/2AATXMU","link","http://bit.ly/2AATXMU","bit.ly",2247,1768,240,264,47,13,24,1214

Roughly 120 years since a pioneer of the Zionist movement, Theodore Herzl, convened the first Zionist Congress in Basel, 50 years since the reunification of Jerusalem during the Six Day War, and nearly 70 years after the United States was the first country to give recognition to the modern State of Israel, the President of the United States has for the first time formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Today, December 6, 2017, the President also announced that he will move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This day will forever be etched in the history books as one of the great moments in history. The strongest and most prosperous country in the world has rectified what has been a historic injustice for far too long, recognizing the ancient and sacred city that has been the eternal capital of the Jewish people for over 3,000 years, and the capital of the one and only Jewish State since 1948. This announcement recognizes the reality that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, and sends a powerful message that rejects all those who wrongly seek to delegitimize Israel through falsifying and erasing the profound ties that exist between the Jewish people and Jerusalem.  I encourage countries around the world to now engage in their own moment of historical moral clarity, to follow America's lead in recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, immediately begin the process of moving their embassies to Jerusalem, and stand with the United States and Israel in voting against any future effort in international forums that attempts to deny historic truth.  http://bit.ly/2Afd5R2","link","http://bit.ly/2Afd5R2","bit.ly",4827,672,490,832,16,8,29,511

Every person, man or woman, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect in the workplace. In recent months, we've seen wave after wave of appalling sexual harassment and assault allegations -- from Hollywood, to newsrooms, to the halls of Congress. And powerful men who have abused their positions have been held to account. Congress is not above the laws, and secret settlements with taxpayer money to cover up harassment should no longer be tolerated. This legislation seeks to empower victims of harassment to report those crimes and to hold the perpetrators accountable.  http://bit.ly/2zdfyJw","link","http://bit.ly/2zdfyJw","bit.ly",1801,1176,204,141,78,16,5,25

This complacency has bred confidence among our adversaries and instilled fear among our allies. President Trump’s National Security Strategy represents a course correction in our American priorities that has been direly needed. I have long contended that border security is national security; that we must call our enemies by their name in order to defeat their threat; and that America should fiercely protect our democratic alliances while advancing cooperative partnerships based on shared interests. This strategy aims to advance U.S. leadership in the world by restoring the idea that American strength and confidence are the best means for deterring war and promoting peace. This document addresses necessary issues to protect our homeland, while laying out a reasoned defense for economic security as the source of confidence both at home and abroad and underwriting our ability to achieve peace through strength. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues and the Trump administration to restore American leadership in all key regions of the world and to foster the prosperity and safety of the American people.   http://bit.ly/2CFBg7S","link","http://bit.ly/2CFBg7S","bit.ly",980,306,92,121,20,5,5,214

They tenaciously defended U.S. sovereignty and the right, courageous decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The veto confirms the strengthening of U.S. leadership at the U.N. and is a stark contrast to one year ago, when the previous administration shamefully permitted the adoption of Security Council Resolution 2334.   Rather than being complicit with the U.N.'s obsessive hostility towards Israel and its attempt to harangue the United States, the other 14 countries on the U.N. Security Council should focus on rejecting efforts to delegitimize Israel, recognize the reality that Jerusalem is Israel's capital, and start moving their embassies there.  https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=3555","link","https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=3555","cruz.senate.gov",4410,523,402,579,19,8,10,407

By doubling the child tax credit, and providing rate cuts for individual taxpayers in all brackets, this bill allows Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money, and brings needed relief to working families. By repealing Obamacare’s individual mandate, 6.5 million Americans who have been unfairly fined by the IRS for not being able to afford health insurance will now have immediate and significant relief. And because we’ve significantly lowered the corporate tax rate, businesses that have fled overseas to escape our high corporate taxes will bring jobs and roughly $2.9 trillion in capital back to the American economy.   In particular, this bill is a win for Texans. Texas taxpayers will now be able to write off up to $10,000 in property taxes, a measure I fought to maintain. Further, it includes my Student Opportunity Amendment, which prioritizes the education of the next generation by expanding 529 College Savings accounts. Parents can now save up to $10K per year per child to use for K-12 education expenses in public, private, and religious schools. While I would have preferred to see the education of every child prioritized – including homeschool students – I will continue working with my colleagues in Congress to expand school choice and opportunity.   This legislation marks a significant step toward fulfilling our promise to provide the American people real, fundamental tax relief. I will continue fighting to give every Texan, and every American, the ability to keep more of their hard-earned money and spend it as they wish, not as the federal government commands.","status",NA,NA,8314,2071,1195,1294,89,23,33,1576

Hijacking electoral institutions and repressing the opposition has severely undermined democratic order and the will of the people. It is incumbent on the U.S. to address Ortega’s brazen overreach and incentivize meaningful reform. If we allow Nicaragua’s ruling elite to exploit international loans to further embed their corrupt enterprises with anti-American regimes, we are turning a blind eye. From Venezuela’s petro-dollars scheme to Russia’s arms sales and intelligence operations – this external influence will solidify the future for the people of Nicaragua, and raises national security implications not only for the U.S., but for all of our allies throughout the Western Hemisphere.  http://bit.ly/2l0qtxQ","link","http://bit.ly/2l0qtxQ","bit.ly",706,384,104,35,54,9,3,69

The Iranian people want freedom and an end to the ayatollahs' reign of terror. The sanctions relief provided under the disastrous Obama nuclear deal has done nothing but line the pockets of Iran’s mullahs whose sole desire is to spread their hateful ideology and do everything they can to murder Americans, Israelis, and our allies across Europe and the Middle East. I urge the Trump Administration to do everything possible to support these courageous protestors, and I call upon freedom-loving nations everywhere to rally behind and publicly express their support for the Iranian people.  ‪http://bit.ly/2zPxNC8‬","status",NA,NA,6032,850,650,463,46,16,22,186
