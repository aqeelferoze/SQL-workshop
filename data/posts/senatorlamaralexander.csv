Senator Lamar Alexander – as chairman of the Senate education committee - sponsored legislation that the president signed into law in December of 2015 to repeal common core and other federal mandates, reverse the trend toward a national school board and restore local control. The Wall Street Journal called it the “the largest devolution of federal control to the states in a quarter-century.”   Last year, at the National Governors Association’s (NGA) February meeting, Alexander, a former chairman of the governors’ organization, thanked the nations’ governors for “leading the charge” to fix No Child Left Behind. At that same meeting, the nations’ governors created the James Madison Award to recognize members of Congress who support federalism and the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guaranteeing states’ rights. The governors named Sen. Alexander as the first-ever recipient of the award for his work to fix No Child Left Behind.   Now that Washington is not calling the shots, this story – one of four Gannett Tennessee stories on the Every Student Succeeds Act - is about what Tennessee schools are doing with their new authority under Sen.

And then just Tuesday Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said that repeal and replacement of Obamacare would be done “concurrently.”  To me, “simultaneously” and “concurrently” means Obamacare should be finally repealed only when there are concrete, practical reforms in place that give Americans access to truly affordable health care.  The American people deserve health care reform that’s done in the right way, for the right reasons, in the right amount of time. It’s not about developing a quick fix. It’s about working toward long-term solutions that work for everyone.  One way to think about what “simultaneously” and “concurrently” mean is to think about Obamacare in the same way you would think about a collapsing bridge in your hometown, because that is just what is happening with Obamacare.  According to the Tennessee insurance commissioner, the Obamacare insurance market in our state is “very near collapse.” Across the country, premiums and co-pays are up and employers have cut jobs to afford Obamacare costs. Medicaid mandates are consuming state budgets. In one third of America’s counties citizens with federal subsidies only have a single choice of company to buy insurance from on Obamacare exchanges. Without quick action, next year they may have zero choices. Their subsidies may be worth as much as a bus ticket in a town where no buses run.  If your local bridge in Wyoming or Tennessee were “very near collapse,” the first thing you would do is send in a rescue crew to repair it temporarily so no one else is hurt.  Then you would build a better bridge, or more accurately, many bridges, as states develop their own plans for providing access to truly affordable health care to replace the old bridge. Finally, when the new bridges are finished you would close the old bridge. That is how we propose to proceed: to rescue those trapped in a failing system, to replace that system with a functional market, or markets, and then repeal Obamacare for good.  First, we will offer a rescue plan so the 11 million Americans who buy individual insurance now on the exchanges can continue to do so while we build a better set of concrete, practical alternatives. Second, we will build better systems providing Americans with more choices of insurance that costs less. Note I say systems, not one system. If anyone is expecting Senator McConnell to roll a wheelbarrow on to the senate floor with a comprehensive Republican health care plan they’re going to be waiting a long time because we don’t believe in that. We don’t want to replace a failed Obamacare federal system with another failed federal system. So, we will build better systems providing Americans with more choices of insurance that costs less. We will do this by moving more health care decisions out of Washington and into the hands of states and patients and by reducing harmful taxes. And we will do this carefully, step by step, so that it is effective. Finally, we will repeal what remains of the law that did all this damage and created all this risk.  That is what we WILL do.  Here is what we WILL NOT do.  This is not the bill for Medicare reform. That will be handled separately.  Secondly, you will not be disqualified from getting insurance if you have a pre-existing health condition and if you are under the age of 26, you will still be able to be covered on your parent’s plan. That is what we mean by repeal and replace, simultaneously and concurrently.  Here are three steps we will take, beginning immediately:  1. The rescue plan — 6% of Americans with insurance buy their health insurance in the individual market, including the Obamacare exchanges. This is where much of today’s turmoil is: higher premiums, higher co pays and insurers pulling out of markets. While we build a replacement, we want the 11 million Americans who now buy on the exchanges to be able to continue to buy private insurance. This will require Congress and the President to take action before March 1, which is when insurance companies begin to decide whether they will offer insurance in these markets during 2018.  In general, the goal is to get as close as possible to allowing any state-approved plan to count as health insurance under Obamacare rules, while we are transitioning to new systems. Among actions that will help are to allow individuals to use their existing Obamacare subsidies to purchase state-approve insurance outside Obamacare exchanges; adjust Obamacare’s special enrollment periods; approve the temporary continuation of cost sharing subsidies for deductibles and copays; allow states more flexibility to determine so-called “essential health benefits,” age-rating rules and small group restrictions; expand health savings accounts; eventually provide tax credits to help lower income Americans buy insurance; and repeal the individual mandate when new insurance market rules are in place. When the new administration rewrites the guidance on Obamacare section 1332 state innovations waivers to allow for more state flexibility, states will have the authority to further innovate to build more modern health systems.  2. On employer insurance — 61% of all Americans who have insurance coverage get it on the job. We will repair the damage Obamacare has done so employers can offer employees more personalized, patient-centered care. We will repeal Obamacare’s employer mandate penalty; allow states to determine the so-called “essential health benefits” and thereby lower costs for small businesses; repeal Obamacare’s restrictions on grandfathered health plans, wellness benefits, small group plans, and provide more flexibility for small businesses so they can work together to buy insurance. This will mean more state authority, more choices and lower costs for the 178 million Americans who obtain insurance on the job.  3. Medicaid — 22% of all insured Americans are covered by Medicaid. We will give states more flexibility to offer these 62 million citizens more options by making federal Medicaid waivers more flexible.  In summary, we will first send in a rescue crew to repair temporarily a collapsing health care market so no one else is hurt. Then, step by step, we will build better systems that give Americans access to truly affordable health care. We will do this by moving health care decisions out of Washington, D.C., and back to states and patients.  Finally, when our reforms become concrete, practical alternatives, we will repeal the remaining parts of Obamacare in order to repair the damage it has caused Americans.  This is what I believe we mean when we say Obamacare should be repealed and replaced, simultaneously and concurrently.","status",NA,NA,141,181,53,6,3,0,1,8

That real reason? She has spent more than three decades helping children from low-income families choose a better school. Specifically, Democrats resent her support for allowing tax dollars to follow children to schools their low-income parents’ choose — although wealthy families choose their children’s schools every day.  Tax dollars supporting school choice is hardly subversive or new. In 2016, $121 billion in federal Pell Grants and new student loans followed 11 million college students to accredited public, private or religious schools of their choice, whether Notre Dame, Yeshiva, the University of Tennessee or Nashville’s auto diesel college. These aid payments are, according to Webster’s — “vouchers”-exactly the same form of payments that Mrs. DeVos supports for schools. America’s experience with education vouchers began in 1944 with the GI Bill. As veterans returned from World War II, federal tax dollars followed them to the college of their choice. Why, then, is an idea that helped produce the Greatest Generation and the world’s best colleges such a dangerous idea for our children?  Mrs. DeVos testified that she opposes Washington, D.C., requiring states to adopt vouchers, unlike her critics who delight in a National School Board imposing their mandates on states, for example, Common Core academic standards. So, who is in the mainstream here? The GI Bill, Pell Grants, student loans, both Presidents Bush, President Trump, the 25 states that allow parents to choose among public and private schools, Congress with its passage of the Washington, D.C. voucher program, 45 U.S. senators who voted in 2015 to allow states to use existing federal dollars for vouchers, Betsy DeVos — or her senate critics?  The second reason Democrats oppose Mrs. DeVos is that she supports charter schools — public schools with fewer government and union rules so that teachers have more freedom to teach and parents have more freedom to choose the schools. In 1992, Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor party created a dozen charter schools. Today there are 6,800 in 43 states and the District of Columbia. President Obama’s last Education Secretary was a charter school founder. Again, who is in the mainstream? Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor party, Presidents Bush, Clinton and Obama; the last six U.S. Education Secretaries, the U.S. Congress, 43 states and the District of Columbia, Betsy DeVos — or her senate critics?  Her critics dislike that she is wealthy. Would they be happier if she had spent her money denying children from low-income families choices of schools?  Mrs. DeVos’ senate opponents are grasping for straws. We didn’t have time to question her, they say, even though she met with each one of them in their offices, and her hearing lasted nearly an hour and a half longer than either of President Obama’s education secretaries.  Now she is answering 837 written follow up questions from Democratic committee members — 1,397 if you include all the questions within a question. By comparison, Republicans asked President Obama’s first education secretary 53 written follow-up questions and his second education secretary 56 written follow-up questions, including questions within a question. In other words, Democrats have asked Mrs. DeVos 25 times as many follow-up questions as Republicans asked of either of President Obama’s education secretaries.  Finally, Democrats are throwing around conflict of interest accusations. But Betsy DeVos has signed an agreement with the independent Office of Government Ethics to divest, within 90 days of her confirmation, possible conflicts of interest identified by the ethics office, as every cabinet secretary is required to do. That agreement is on the internet.  Tax returns? Federal law does not require disclosure of tax returns for cabinet members, or for U.S. Senators. Both cabinet members and senators are already required to publish extensive disclosures of their holdings, income and debts. Cabinet members must also sign an agreement with the Office of Government Ethics to eliminate potential conflicts of interest.  One year ago, because I believe presidents should have their cabinet in place in order to govern, I worked to confirm promptly President Obama’s nomination of John King to be Education Secretary, even though I disagreed with him.  Even though they disagree with her, Democrats should also promptly confirm Betsy DeVos. Few Americans have done as much to help low-income students have a choice of better schools. She is on the side of our children. Her critics may resent that, but this says more about them than it does about her.","status",NA,NA,838,7911,1906,35,79,94,61,3687

Sen. Alexander said: “On Nov. 29, 2016, the United States Department of Education released its final regulation for implementing the accountability provisions of the Every Student Succeeds Act – and the rule specifically does things or requires states to do things that Congress said in our law fixing No Child Left Behind that the Department can’t do. In other words, the Department’s regulation specifically violates the law. It’s not a matter of just being within the authority granted by the law.

And we said to the Department, ‘You can’t tell states exactly how to rate the public schools in your state,’ but this rule does that.   “This is really a question of whether you believe that the United States Congress writes the law or whether you believe the U.S. Department of Education writes the law. I believe under Article I of our Constitution the United States Congress writes the law, and when it’s signed by the president, then that’s the law and that the regulations have to stay within it — and that is especially true when Congress has prohibited the Department from doing these things that the rule does.   “And this isn’t a trivial matter. The whole issue around the bill fixing No Child Left Behind was to reverse the trend to a national school board and restore to states, classroom teachers, and parents decisions about what to do about their children in public schools. Teachers, governors, school boards all were fed up with Washington telling them so much about what to do about their children in 100,000 public schools. So this rule, which contravenes the law specifically, goes to the heart of the bill fixing No Child Left Behind, which received 85 votes in the United States Senate.”","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatorlamaralexander/videos/10154351025778837/",NA,60,159,11,6,0,0,5,51

This is an opportunity for him to visit one of our country’s most vibrant cities and to honor one of our most important Presidents, Andrew Jackson.  It is also an opportunity for the president to learn more about the plight of 230,000 Tennesseans who will likely have zero health insurance options in 2018 if Congress does not act soon to replace and repeal major parts of the Affordable Care Act.  Tennessee’s state insurance commissioner has been warning since August that our state’s Obamacare insurance exchange is “very near collapse.”  Premiums in the individual market rose as much as 62 percent last year. Conditions are so bad that in three quarters of Tennessee’s counties, only one insurance company offers policies to those who buy on the exchange.  The same is true in one third of all counties in the United States.  In the Knoxville area, the one remaining insurance company on the exchange has pulled out for 2018, so it's a near certainty there will be zero insurance options for 40,000 Tennesseans who live there. There is a real prospect that unless Congress acts soon to stabilize the market, the same thing may happen to all 230,000 Tennesseans who buy insurance on the exchange.  In other words, in 2018, those with subsidies to help buy insurance on the Obamacare exchange will find the subsidies worth as much as bus tickets in a town with no buses running.  These 230,000 are about 4 percent of Tennesseans who have health insurance but they are some of the most vulnerable citizens in our state.  That is why Republicans’ top priority in Congress is to address this Obamacare emergency in our state and other states.  This week, the U.S. House of Representatives continues its work on legislation to begin the process of replacing and repealing major parts of the Affordable Care Act.  One thing I especially like about the proposed legislation is that it will provide options outside the exchange for the 40,000 Knoxville area residents who, under current law, are almost certain to have zero health insurance options next year because no one will sell them insurance on the exchange.  This will also help citizens in Nashville and other parts of the state. According to the Tennessean, this “change could also give people in the greater Nashville area the chance to access Vanderbilt University Medical Center through off-exchange plans, such as those offered by the Tennessee Farm Bureau.”  The proposal also takes steps to stabilize the individual insurance markets for three years so that insurance companies will be more likely to sell insurance to Americans who buy on the exchanges.  The House proposal will eliminate taxes and mandates that have driven up costs for employers and for the 60 percent of insured Americans who get their health insurance on the job.  The proposal would give states more flexibility over Medicaid (TennCare) to cover more Tennesseans more effectively and to bring costs under control. Partly because of federal mandates, Medicaid was 8 percent of our state budget in the 1980s; it is more than 31 percent today, taking state dollars that otherwise could be used for teachers’ salaries or for keeping college tuition down.  The House of Representatives’ proposal does not repeal everything in the Affordable Care Act. For example, it does not repeal the provision providing access to insurance for those with a pre-existing condition. And it does not repeal the provision offering children the opportunity to stay on their parents’ policies until age 26. And the proposal does not seek to change Medicare benefits, where most Americans over 65 obtain their health insurance.  Our health care system is complex but our goal should be simple: Give Americans more choices of lower-cost insurance by moving more health care decisions out of Washington, D.C., to states and patients.","status",NA,NA,209,331,55,26,6,2,7,178

Soon the nomination is likely to move to the floor for debate.  Some have suggested that instead of allowing a majority of senators to decide whether to approve the Gorsuch nomination, there should first be a “cloture” vote to determine whether to cut off debate.   Cutting off debate requires the approval of 60 senators.  So, if 41 of the 46 Democrat senators vote not to cut off debate, there would never be an up-or-down majority vote to approve Gorsuch.   In other words, the 41 Democrat senators would have filibustered to death the Gorsuch nomination.   Filibustering to death the Gorsuch nomination—or any presidential nomination, for that matter—flies in the face of 230 years of Senate tradition.  Throughout the Senate’s history, approval of even the most controversial presidential nominations has required only a majority vote.       For example, in 1991, President George H.W Bush nominated Judge Clarence Thomas to be an Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court.   The debate was bitter. The Senate confirmed Thomas narrowly, 52-48.  Although Senate rules    allowed any senator to try to filibuster the nomination to death, none did.  In fact, Senate rules have always allowed senators the option to filibuster to death a presidential nomination.  Yet, it has almost never happened.   According to the former Senate Historian, with one possible exception, which I will describe later, the number of Supreme Court justices in our country’s history who have been denied their seats by filibuster is zero.   The number of cabinet members in our country’s history who have been denied their seats by a filibuster is zero.   The number of federal district judges in our country’s history who have been denied their seats by a filibuster is zero.   And until 2003, the number of circuit judges in our country’s history who had been denied their seats by filibuster was zero.  Sen. Everett Dirksen did not filibuster President Johnson’s nominees. Sen. Robert Byrd did not filibuster President Reagan’s nominees.  Sen. Howard Baker did not filibuster President Carter’s nominees.  Sen. Bob Dole did not filibuster President Clinton’s nominees.   During most of the 20th century, when one party controlled the White House and the Senate seventy per cent of the time, the minority never filibustered to death a single presidential nominee.  On the other hand, there have been plenty of filibusters on legislation. So many that in 1917, the Senate adopted a cloture rule as a way to end filibusters.  The rule was amended in 1949, 1959, 1975, 1979, and 1986 – always in response to filibusters on legislation, never on nominations.  It was the 1975 change that established the current cloture standard of 60 votes to end debate, except on amendments to the Standing Rules.    Filibustering a presidential nomination has always been treated differently than filibustering a legislative matter.  The filibuster of legislation is perhaps the Senate’s most famous characteristic.  It has been called “democracy’s finest show, the right to talk your head off.”   As the actor Jimmy Stewart says in the movie “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,”  “Wild Horses aren’t going to drag me off this floor until those people have heard everything I’ve got to say, even if it takes all winter.”  The late Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia described the importance of the legislative filibuster in a different in this way. “Our   Founding Fathers,” Sen. Byrd said in his last speech, “intended the Senate to be a continuing body that allows for open and unlimited debate and the protection of minority rights.  Senators have understood this since the Senate first convened.”  In fact, the whole idea of the Senate is not to have majority rule on legislation.   Throughout Senate history, the purpose of the legislative filibuster has been to force consensus on issues, to force there to be a group of senators on either side who have to respect one another’s views so they work together and produce 60 votes on important matters.  Nominations have always been treated differently from legislation.   For example, under Senate Rule 14, any Senator can bring legislation directly to the Calendar of General Orders, bypassing committees.  There is no such power for nominations.    Senate rules allow debate—and therefore the possibility of a filibuster—on a motion to proceed to legislation.  Debate is not allowed on a motion to proceed to nominations.  In summary, while Senate rules have always allowed extended debate or filibusters, the filibuster was never used to block a nomination until recently.    As I mentioned earlier, it was never used to block a Cabinet nomination. Never used to block a federal district judge. Until 2003, never used to block a circuit judge.  And never used to block a Supreme Court Justice, with one possible exception.  That exception occurred in 1968 when President Lyndon Johnson sought to elevate Associate Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice.   When it became clear that a Senate majority would not agree, Johnson engineered a 45-43 cloture vote so that Fortas could save face and appear to have won something, according to the former Senate Historian. Fortas then asked the President to withdraw the nomination.  Other than the Fortas exception, the filibuster was never used to block ANY judicial nomination until 2003 and 2004 when Democrats decided to use the 60 vote cloture requirement to block ten of President George W. Bush’s nominees.   This unprecedented action produced a threat by Republicans to change the Senate rules to make it clear that only a majority vote is required to approve a presidential nomination.   There was a negotiation and eventually five of Bush’s nominees were approved, five were blocked and the rules were not changed.  Then in 2011 and 2013 Republicans returned the favor by seeking to block five of President Obama’s nominees for the circuit court by insisting on a 60 vote cloture on each.        Republicans alleged the president was trying to pack the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia with three liberal judges.    To overcome Republican objections, Democrats invoked the so-called “nuclear option.”  They broke the Senate rules to change the rules.  The new rule eliminated the possibility of 60 vote cloture motions for all presidential nominees except for the Supreme Court.    There have been other examples of minority senators filibustering nominations to death, all of them during the last three administrations, and all involving subcabinet nominations.  And, of course, there have been delays in considering nominations.   My own nomination in 1991 as U.S. Education Secretary was delayed 51 days by a Democratic senator.  President Reagan's nomination of Ed Meese as Attorney General of the United States was delayed a year by a Democratic Senate.   No one has ever disputed our right in the Senate, regardless of who was in charge, to use our constitutional duty of advice and consent to delay and examine, sometimes cause nominations to be withdrawn or even to defeat nominees by a majority vote.   But as we approach a vote on Neil Gorsuch on the floor of the Senate, it is useful to remember that the tradition of the United States Senate has been to treat legislative matters and nominations differently.    Filibuster to death legislation, yes.  Filibuster to death presidential nominations, no.   Should the Gorsuch nomination come to the floor soon, as I believe it will, overwhelming Senate tradition requires that whether to approve it should be decided by a majority vote and that there should be no attempt by the minority to filibuster the nomination to death.","status",NA,NA,106,486,53,8,5,1,4,139

While Senate rules have always allowed senators the option to filibuster to death any presidential nomination, it has almost never happened.  The number of cabinet members ever denied their seats by a filibuster is zero.  The number of district judges ever denied their seats by a filibuster is zero.  Until 2003, the number of circuit court judges ever denied their seats by filibuster was zero.  The number of Supreme Court justices in our country’s history who have been denied their seats by filibuster is zero, with one possible exception.  In 1968, President Johnson sought to elevate Justice Abe Fortas to Chief Justice. Senators of both parties opposed the nomination. President Johnson, not wanting to embarrass a friend, engineered a 45-43 cloture vote, so that Fortas could save face and ""stay on the Court with his head up."" The nomination was then withdrawn.  Still, including the Fortas incident, no Supreme Court justice has ever been denied his or her seat by requiring more than 51 votes. Even Clarence Thomas’s controversial nomination in 1982 was approved by a 52-48 vote.  That does not mean the Senate should rubberstamp every nominee. Senators use our constitutional duty of advice and consent to delay and examine, sometimes causing nominations to be withdrawn even to defeat nominees by a majority vote. My own nomination in 1991 as U.S. Education Secretary was delayed 51 days by a Democratic senator.  Still the Senate never required more than 51 votes to approve any judicial nominee until 2003 and 2004 when Democrats blocked 10 of President George W. Bush’s circuit court nominees by requiring  60-vote “cloture” votes to end debate. Republicans threatened to invoke the so-called “nuclear option” to eliminate 60-vote cloture on judicial nominations before reaching an agreement to confirm five.  In 2011 and 2013, Republicans returned the favor by blocking two of President Obama’s nominees for the Circuit Court. Democrats invoked the “nuclear option” to confirm three others and established the current 51-vote cloture for all nominees except Supreme Court nominees which remains at 60.  Democrats point to Republicans’ refusal to allow the Senate to consider President Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland last year, but Republicans were following the bipartisan Thurmond-Leahy rule — that judicial nominees shouldn’t be confirmed after June of an election year. Republicans extended that rule three months to March, when Garland was nominated and primaries were well underway.  This shouldn’t have surprised Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who, in July 2007, 18 months before the end of President George W. Bush's term, said he would block any Supreme Court nominee except in ""extraordinary circumstances."" And, toward the end of President George H.W. Bush's administration, then-Senator Biden said no Supreme Court nominee should be confirmed ""once the political season is underway.""  Republicans did last year what Senate Democrat leaders said they would do in similar circumstances — give the American people a voice in the selection of the next Supreme Court justice.  Some have suggested that if the Senate restores the tradition of confirming presidential nominees by majority vote, it would lead to the end of the legislative filibuster. I disagree. For 230 years the tradition of the United States Senate has been to treat legislative matters and nominations differently.  The filibuster of legislation is the Senate’s most famous characteristic. It has been called “democracy’s finest show, the right to talk your head off.” It was made famous by Jimmy Stewart in the movie “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.”  The Senate has always allowed extended debate to encourage bipartisan consensus — such as with the Civil Rights Acts of the 1960s  or the 2015 law to fix No Child Left Behind.  Filibuster to death legislation, yes. Filibuster to death presidential nominations, no.  The nomination of Judge Gorsuch should be decided — as Supreme Court nominations have always been for 230 years — by a majority vote.","status",NA,NA,240,684,77,5,38,2,10,192

It’s a great time to celebrate what’s right with America — to reflect on the beauty, magic and serenity of the America outdoors.  Entrance to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and most of Tennessee’s national parks is always free, but over these next two weekends– April 15,16, 22 and 23 — anyone can visit any national park in this country for free.  I’ve come to realize that I was one of the luckiest guys in the world because I grew up in Maryville, Tenn., which means I grew up next to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  When you grow up next to a national park — you really grow up in the park. You spend your weekends and special times there, and the park looms large in many of your childhood memories. I remember, when I was 15, my dad dropped me and two of my friends at Newfound Gap on the day after Christmas when there was three feet of snow on the ground and said, “I’ll pick you up in Gatlinburg” — which was about 15 miles from Newfound Gap. He picked us up later that afternoon.  During National Park Week, the National Park Service and the National Park Foundation will partner together to provide events and opportunities for new and returning visitors who visit our national parks across the country, such as joining a national park ranger for a hike, witnessing reenactments of the American Revolutionary War or participating in Junior Ranger Day — where kids can enjoy a variety of hands-on activities, games and art projects to help them learn about their national parks.  We talk a lot about the importance of science and math, but according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, most high school seniors in America score the worst in history. I cannot think of a better way to encourage the study of U.S. history and what it means to be an American than to explore our country’s national parks.  Last year marked the 100th anniversary of the United States National Park Service — and to celebrate, we honored the employees of the National Park Service who keep the national parks beautiful and safe, who clear the brush from the walking paths or relocate the bears who wander out of the wilderness areas.  Take the time to talk with a park employee when you visit — I’m sure you’ll hear some stories.  When I was governor in 1984, I spent a couple of days hiking in the Smokies to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the park. They assigned a ranger to watch me, Dwight McCarter. Dwight has more stories than anybody, and some of his best ones are even true! He has searched for 120 lost people, he has tried to find every airplane that crashed in the park, and he’s traced the route of the Hawkins-Meigs Line that was supposed to establish the boundary between the Cherokees and the settlers.  It is my hope that Americans across the country will take some time next week to visit one of our country’s many national parks. I believe it is our responsibility to ensure that the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and all other national parks around the country, are protected and preserved so future generations can enjoy them, just like we have.","status",NA,NA,76,118,12,6,2,0,1,29

Patty Murray (D-Wash.). These agreements are essential to the FDA’s ability to review life-saving drugs and medical devices to make sure they are safe for patients. I’m encouraged by the overwhelming support for these agreements in our committee, and want to share a little on why it’s so important that the Senate and House finish our work and vote on reauthorization before the August recess.  First, what are the FDA User Fee Agreements?  There are four different agreements between the FDA and makers of (1) prescription drugs, (2) medical devices, (3) generic drugs, and (4) biosimilars. These agreements are all set to expire on Sept. 30 and must be renewed by Congress. These agreements allow the agency to collect fees from the makers of drugs and medical devices in exchange for more timely and predictable reviews. The legislation the committee passed last week updates and reauthorizes the current agreements, based on recommendations from industry and FDA after a thorough public process and 15 months of bipartisan work in Congress. I believe these are good agreements for patients. They include new provisions to:  · Involve patients in the drug and medical device development process to make sure innovative new drugs and devices address what patients think are most important;  · Dedicate staff to assist in the development and review of rare disease drugs;  · Improve timelines and increase guidance for drug and device combination products, such as heart stents with drugs; and  · Modernize the clinical trial process so we can start to shorten the 8–10 years it takes to develop new drugs and get them to medicine cabinets.  Why are they important?  If you have a family member with cancer, or Alzheimer’s or diabetes, you want the FDA to move as quickly as it can to get drugs and devices through the investment and regulatory process into patients’ medicine cabinets and doctors’ offices. The user fees pay one out of every four dollars that make the FDA’s work to do this possible.  Congress ended last year passing the 21st Century Cures Act, which Leader McConnell called “the most important piece of legislation” that year. 94 Senators voted for the legislation, which also had the support of President Obama and Vice President Biden. Again, these user fee agreements fund the FDA, the agency responsible for making sure the promising research supported by 21st Century Cures actually reaches patients.  What are the consequences if there is a delay in the reauthorization of the FDA user fee agreements? If these agreements are not renewed by the end of July, the FDA will be forced by law to send layoff notices to more than 5,000 FDA employees to notify them that they may lose their jobs in 60 days. Someone who is reviewing a new cancer drug could be laid off on October 1, before the reviewer is able to finish their work. In addition to harming patients and families that rely on medical innovation, a delay in reauthorizing the user fees would threaten biomedical industry jobs and America’s global leadership in biomedical innovation.   That’s why Senator Murray and I have been working together in a bipartisan way for 15 months to get this done. We want to show the American people we can fulfill the pledge that we made with our 21st Century Cures Act, which funded life-saving research and took steps to move it to patients more rapidly. What happens next?  I’m glad the Senate health committee took the first step in passing these agreements, which I believe are good for patients.

Hoffman of the 2nd Battalion Rangers who stormed the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc on D-Day. Mr. Hoffman, a Memphian, passed away at 91 years old on January 7, 2013. Senator Alexander gave these remarks on the Senate Floor on February 29, 2012.  ""I am here today to praise a remarkable hero who served in one of the most difficult battles in our Nation’s history and who today at 90 years old lives a quiet life in Memphis with his family.  Wilbur K. Hoffman, or 'Bill' to his fellow Rangers, was a member of the Dog Company of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, which in 1944 was among the select few companies that stormed the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc on D-day and turned the war around for the allies.  Forty years after Bill Hoffman and his fellow 2nd Battalion Rangers clambered up the rocky cliffs on the shoreline of France, President Reagan returned to the windswept spot to pay tribute.   President Reagan called them 'the boys of Pointe du Hoc.'  The President said:  'These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war.'  This is Bill Hoffman, a hero who helped free a continent and end a war.  Bill volunteered to join the Army in 1942. A year later he volunteered to join the Rangers, a select group that were charged with special missions. Bill says that because of all of their special training, they would simply 'get the mission done.' Bill got out of the Army in 1945, after the war, but took a look at the job market and said, 'I think I’ll go back in.' Bill served in the Army for 24 years. Bill likes to say, 'Everything that happened, I volunteered for.' And if you happen to ask how he feels when he looks back, he will say just as plainly, 'No regrets.'  This year the Army has awarded Bill a Purple Heart. But not for the first time. During World War II, the Army tried. But Bill, in an Army ward surrounded by soldiers who had lost arms and legs in fighting, believed his wounds did not measure up, and so he said, 'I don’t think so.'  Bill’s son David, more than 60 years after his father first declined the Purple Heart, contacted the Army about trying again. Capturing his father’s humility in declining the medal decades ago, David calls his dad 'the nicest guy you’ll ever meet. Friendly and outgoing but by the same token, he doesn’t like to talk about himself' says the son.  Bill is the father of seven children, and nearly all of them who could join the service did or married someone who did.  Bill is not a native Tennessean. He was born in Newark, NJ. He came to Tennessee first as a Ranger in training. The Rangers came from all over the country and assembled in Camp Forrest in Tullahoma for training. Bill’s wife came down to visit him there for a couple of days during training, and it must have had a real effect on her, because more than 30 years later, after Bill was out of the Army after 24 years of service, and they were living in New York State, Bill’s wife said to him, 'I want to go to Tennessee. I like it down there.'   So they packed up the U-Haul and moved to Ashland City, along the Cumberland River.  Today Bill is one of only three Rangers left from the original 2nd Battalion Dog Company. While the Ranger reunions used to occur once every 2 years, the guys are getting old, Bill says, and now they are doing them every year. 'Good bunch of guys,' Bill calls his fellow heroes. 'They say Ranger friendships are forever. It’s true.'  Bill turns 91 on Friday. It is an honor for me to wish this American hero a happy birthday.  Congratulations, Bill Hoffman. We’re proud of you. Your Nation is proud of you.""","status",NA,NA,58,31,5,4,0,0,0,3

So last year, I got $110 in royalties just as they did.   Now here’s the point: The outdated consent decree says it sets the rate by which songwriters get paid – it’s way out of date, and it’s not a market rate. That’s the first problem.   And, second, the Justice Department has issued an interpretation that would say that the four of us working together writing songs would have to get lawyers or make agreements because we might be represented by different people.   In other words, the Justice Department in Washington would turn upside down the writing of songs in Nashville and put a lot of complicated agreements with it.   So my hope is the Department of Justice will take a new look at this outdated consent decree and get a market rate, so songwriters can get paid the real value of their songs. And so that the federal government doesn’t mess up the way songs are co-written in Nashville.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatorlamaralexander/videos/10154640442228837/",NA,330,356,89,26,6,8,5,97

Let me repeat: it makes no change in the law protecting people with pre-existing conditions, no change in Medicare benefits, and increases funding for Medicaid—that’s TennCare—at the rate of inflation.  Here are some other benefits for Tennesseans I see in this draft:   • Offers health care coverage to 162,000 Tennesseans who make less than $12,000 a year, and under the current law, receive zero help buying insurance.   • Means the 350,000 Tennesseans who buy their insurance in the individual market – these are Tennesseans who don’t get their insurance on the job or who don’t get it from the government – are more likely to be able to buy insurance next year instead of being in the collapsing Obamacare exchanges where there may be only one option – or even zero options – to buy insurance.   • Repeals the health insurance tax, which drives up the cost of premiums.   • Gives the state more flexibility and continues federal cost-sharing, which our state insurance commissioner said will help bring down the cost of premiums.  • Slows down sky-rocketing premiums, which in Tennessee have gone up 176 percent over four years.   • Repeals the medical device tax on one of our state’s largest exports.   • Repeals the employer mandate penalty, which should mean that employers should be able to offer employees more choices of insurance at a lower-cost—and about 60 percent of us get our insurance on the job.   • Ends the tax on individuals who choose not to buy insurance.   • Provides more money for hospitals that serve low-income Tennesseans who don’t have insurance.   • Provides new funding for opioid abuse, and opioid abuse is a rampant epidemic in our state.   • Provides new Medicaid funding for mental health to double the number of days of in-patient treatment.  I’m going to continue to review this draft. I’m going to see what it costs when the Congressional Budget Office gives its report. Then, I’m going to stay focused on it next week as the bill goes to the Senate floor – where it will be subject to virtually unlimited amendments – and my focus will be on how it affects Tennesseans.","status",NA,NA,812,1446,523,59,16,10,20,571

Marvin Kaplan and William Emanuel, President Trump's nominees to the NLRB, are eminently qualified to be confirmed. Their confirmation can help restore the board to its intended purpose….  While board partisanship didn't start under the last administration, it did become much worse.  A Wall Street Journal editorial, quoting a report by the Coalition for a Democratic Workplace and Littler's Workplace Policy Institute, found that under the previous administration the NLRB ""upended 4,559 total years of established law.""  These legal whipsaws create confusion for employers, employees, and unions. It does not serve the intent of the law, which is stable labor relations and free flow of commerce.  Here's what we're talking about: Imagine that you are one of the 700,000 Americans who own and run your own franchise. Successfully operating a franchise business is one of the most important ways to climb the ladder of success.   In 2015, the NLRB issued a decision creating a new ""joint-employer"" standard that discourages companies from franchising. It was the biggest attack on the opportunity for small-business men and women to make their way into the middle class in years.  Or take the board's ambush election rule that hurts both employees and employers. The rule means union organizers can force an election in as little as 11 days, before an employer and many employees even have a chance to figure out what is going on.   The rule forces employers to hand over an employee's personal information, such as email addresses and work locations, so union organizers can track them down, regardless of whether the employee would prefer to have his or her privacy protected.  I look forward to the Senate voting this week to begin righting the board.","link","http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/sen-lamar-alexander-fill-out-the-nlrb-and-restore-its-neutrality/article/2630333","washingtonexaminer.com",122,309,22,7,2,0,7,143

We’re focused on the 6% of Americans with insurance who don’t get it from the government or on the job. That’s called the individual market. That’s where almost all the Obamacare debate has been the last seven years. And the premiums have skyrocketed. So have the co-pays and the deductibles, especially for people who get no government support to help buy their insurance. What we’re trying to do is to see if we can take one or two or three small steps in September that lower premiums in 2018. And that’s why we’ve had the insurance commissioners in yesterday, the governors today.”  http://www.hughhewitt.com/wp-content/uploads/09-07-Hewitt-LamarAlexander.mp3","status",NA,NA,155,311,10,4,6,1,1,65

The committee’s hearings began last week and continue tomorrow.    “The whole focus was on Tennesseans and Americans who buy their insurance on the individual market – that’s songwriters, farmers, self-employed people who don’t get insurance from the government, or they don’t get it on the job, and they’re getting priced out of the market because premiums are skyrocketing. My purpose is to bring those premiums down in the year 2018, and to do that we have to take action this month. Governor Haslam came and gave excellent testimony. Our state insurance commissioner Julie McPeak was here, and more than 50 senators each day of both parties came to talk about how can we get premiums down in the next year. So, I’m very hopeful that by the end of the month the Senate will come to a bipartisan, limited result that will signal to the people of Tennessee that we are going to get these premiums under control and are going to set them down in future years.”","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatorlamaralexander/videos/10154898416923837/",NA,259,638,43,12,4,5,11,152

All we're asking him to do is to consider a proposal that he wanted to have. So I'll give him credit for seeing the need for a short-term bipartisan solution and engineering it to be done. So now he’s got it, he can decide what he wants to do with it. I think he'll probably like it after he fixes it, improves it. And I think it’s likely to become law.”   “The bill gives the states the flexibility to approve things like the Iowa waiver, or the Alaska waiver, or the Oklahoma waiver, or Minnesota or New Hampshire. When states have asked permission of the federal government to create different insurance plans with more choices and lower costs. That's something we haven't gotten in eight years of debate.

I was already working on that with Senator Murray, a Democrat from Washington, and so last week, we presented a plan like that with 12 Republican sponsors and 12 Democrats. Here is why it’s important to Tennesseans: if you change jobs or lose your job, you go from having employer-based health insurance to going into what we call the individual market, [where] premiums have gone up 176 percent in the last four years. They’re scheduled to go up another 36 percent this year. There is a threat that insurers might just pull out of a collapsing market. I don’t want that to happen, so we’re going to do our best in the next few weeks to make sure we stabilize the market, reduce premiums, avoid chaos and make sure Tennesseans have an option of affordable insurance to buy.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatorlamaralexander/videos/10155005981833837/",NA,869,759,137,49,25,8,12,178

The nine million people who purchase insurance in the individual market who do not qualify for a subsidy are really getting hammered by skyrocketing prices – in Tennessee, premiums have increased 176 percent in four years, and an additional 58 percent this year. Both Congress and the Administration need to act to provide relief for these Americans.   Senator Murray and I worked together on an agreement, co-sponsored by 11 other Republicans and 11 other Democrats, which the Congressional Budget Office says will prevent a 25 percent price increase in premiums by 2020 by paying cost sharing subsidies, decrease the federal dollars spent on ACA premiums subsides, and as a result, lower the deficit. The agreement would also give states the authority to use the innovation waiver already in the law to find other ways to lower premiums. Yesterday, President Trump said he supported the Alexander-Murray agreement becoming law by the end of the year.  I look forward to working with him on this and hearing more about his priorities.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/senatorlamaralexander/photos/a.487153598836.260231.89927603836/10155089737738837/?type=3",NA,130,464,14,6,17,0,12,195

It has the support of President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has said every Senate Democrat would vote for it.

And I was about to leave, and a lady walked up to me and said, “Senator, thank you for what you're doing to help me with insurance.”   I said, “Well, what do you mean?”   She said, “My name is Marty. I'm a self-employed farmer. And the year before Obamacare started, my monthly insurance premium was $300. Next year it's $1,300, and it's very hard for me to afford.”   I said, “I guess you're one of those Americans who work hard and you don't get any government subsidy to help you pay for your health insurance.   She said, “That's exactly right. I have to pay for the whole thing myself.”   I said, “Well, Marty, I’ve got a Christmas present for you.”   If Congress can pass by the end of the month legislation that would lower your premiums in the year 2019 by 18 percent-- that's according to Avalere-- which is one of the leading health consulting firms in the country, who made the announcement yesterday. So if your premiums are $1,300 a month, that's a couple thousand dollars less you'll have to pay. That's still way too high. Or if the Senate and the House agree on a tax bill that removes the individual mandate and the Congressional Budget Office is right, that will put upward pressure on those same rates but only 10 percent.   So you're still going to get an 8 percent decrease in your rates in 2019, and that's about $1,000 in your pocket. Those are real dollars. Marty, has seen, if she's like the average Tennessean, her premiums rise 176 percent over the last five years and she has seen them go up an average this year of 58 percent more.   So a very good Christmas present for Marty, and men and women like her across this country, would be for this Congress, before the end of the month, to pass what we call the Alexander-Murray and the Collins-Nelson legislation which will lower premiums by 18 percent.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatorlamaralexander/videos/10155113668368837/",NA,481,1234,109,28,180,9,22,323

Read my op-ed in today’s Tennessean to learn more about it.    The Tennessean: Lamar Alexander: Why tax reform will benefit Tennesseans December 22, 2017 http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/2017/12/22/lamar-alexander-why-tax-reform-benefit-tennesseans/976059001/ http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/2017/12/22/lamar-alexander-why-tax-reform-benefit-tennesseans/976059001/   Congress and President Trump delivered a well-deserved Christmas present to Tennessee families and businesses.  The tax reform bill that Congress sent to the president will help create more good-paying jobs for Tennessee families and let Tennesseans keep more of the money they earn in their pockets.   This law, which is the first major tax reform passed in 31 years, nearly doubles the standard deduction — which means twice as much of your income is not taxed at all.  Doubling the standard deduction will also make it easier for Tennesseans to file their taxes because most Americans will not have to go through the arduous process of itemizing every deduction.  The law doubles the child tax credit, which means parents can receive a tax credit worth up to $2,000 per child — and you can receive as much as $1,400 of the child tax credit as a refund.   A family of four making a little over $70,000 a year will save more than $2,000 on their taxes, and a single mother making $41,000 a year will see a $1,300 or 73 percent reduction in her taxes.    For those who say only the wealthy will get a tax break, people making $100,000 or more pay 78 percent of federal taxes today, and after this bill is signed into law, they will pay slightly more.  This law also repeals the individual mandate, which has been a particularly cruel tax to lower-income Tennesseans — most of the people in our state who pay the individual mandate penalty make less than $50,000 a year.  One of the most exciting things we can expect from the law is new business investment— which means more jobs and new facilities in Tennessee. Not only will this mean better jobs for you or your neighbor, it means a healthier economy for your neighborhood, your town, and our state.  For example, just this month I talked about the tax reform legislation with Fred Smith, the CEO of FedEx – one of Tennessee’s largest employers. Mr. Smith said that if the tax bill passed, FedEx will buy more airplanes which will create thousands of jobs in the United States — and many of them will be right here in Tennessee.   This law will also help us compete against other countries for jobs and new businesses.  The United States has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world — 35 percent — which has driven 4,700 American companies overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates in other countries over the past ten years.  This new law lowers the corporate tax rate to 21 percent-- about the worldwide average— and gives businesses the opportunity to bring money back to the U.S. from overseas and deduct their capital investments in the first year.    This means businesses will have more reasons to move their headquarters to Tennessee or expand their facilities here at home instead of overseas, which will help grow jobs and put more money in the pockets of Tennesseans.   Nearly two months ago, President Trump met with Republican senators, and he said that he had signed more legislation in the first 100 days of his presidency than any other president since President Harry Truman.  That means the Senate is the most productive since President Truman because the president cannot sign legislation into law if the Senate doesn’t pass it.   It doesn’t always make the news when Congress passes a law that helps the American people — but I expect most Tennessee families will begin seeing the benefits of this new law in their paychecks early next year. And in the coming years, we’ll see more businesses expand and invest and grow jobs. And that is a Christmas present Tennesseans deserve.
