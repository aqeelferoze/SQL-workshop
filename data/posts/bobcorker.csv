That is not a legacy I want to leave.  I truly believe we can solve our mandatory spending problem without harming those currently dependent on these programs, and I have offered numerous legislative proposals toward that end.

Our team remains in close contact with the State Department. Secretary Tillerson has said he willingly accepts this challenge, and I look forward to sitting down with him soon to discuss this proposal and how he believes he can accomplish his work at these budget levels. At the end of the day, while the administration proposes a budget, ultimately it is the role of Congress to dispose it and fund government.

Through the years, numbers of special envoys have accumulated at the State Department, and in many cases, their creation has done more harm than good by creating an environment in which people work around the normal diplomatic processes in lieu of streamlining them. That is one reason our committee took bipartisan action last month to require Senate confirmation of special envoys while empowering the secretary to reduce bureaucracy by reining in these often unnecessary positions. I appreciate the work Secretary Tillerson has done to responsibly review the organizational structure of special envoys and look forward to going through these changes in detail.","link","http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/28/politics/tillerson-state-dept-envoys/index.html","cnn.com",173,135,14,3,7,2,4,30

I know that we will continue to have an impact for the remainder of our term, and I look forward to finding other ways to make a difference in the future.

And during my 10 years and 11 months in the Senate, I have consistently fought for fiscal discipline in Washington.  I have authored comprehensive legislation to address America’s debt crisis, including the Commitment to American Prosperity (CAP) Act and the Fiscal Sustainability Act. I also have taken some really tough votes against very popular policies, including appropriations bills, budget resolutions, defense authorizations, disaster funding, and even a veterans’ bill.    But at the same time, I have consistently advocated for pro-growth tax reform. And in my view, these are not mutually exclusive priorities.   From the beginning of this debate, I have been a cheerleader for legislation that – while allowing for current policy assumptions and reasonable dynamic scoring – would not add to the deficit and set rates that are permanent in nature.  I worked closely with Senator Toomey to negotiate the budget agreement that paved the way for this legislation. And I have worked diligently over the past few weeks with Senate leadership and the White House to make improvements.   While I support a number of the provisions included in this legislation and continue to believe it would have been fairly easy to alter the bill in a way that would have been more fiscally sound without harming the pro-growth policies, unfortunately, it is clear that the caucus is in a different place.  This is yet another tough vote. I am disappointed. I wanted to get to yes. But at the end of the day, I am not able to cast aside my fiscal concerns and vote for legislation that I believe, based on the information I currently have, could deepen the debt burden on future generations.  I thank the administration, Senate leadership, and members of the tax-writing committee for working with me in good faith, and as I shared with President Trump when I called him a short time ago, I will take a close look at the product developed in conference before making a decision on the final legislation.","status",NA,NA,2989,5259,393,469,47,27,59,598

The committee’s action shows that Congress and the administration stand united against the rogue North Korean regime. These bills support a comprehensive U.S. approach and will help the administration address the most acute threat to global security at this time. I appreciate the work of the bill sponsors and am hopeful the full Senate will approve these measures in the near future.","link","http://bit.ly/2k2sTMe","bit.ly",96,137,8,4,1,2,3,31

This bill is far from perfect, and left to my own accord, we would have reached bipartisan consensus on legislation that avoided any chance of adding to the deficit and far less would have been done on the individual side with items that do not generate economic growth.   But after great thought and consideration, I believe that this once-in-a-generation opportunity to make U.S. businesses domestically more productive and internationally more competitive is one we should not miss. While many project that it is very possible over the next ten years we could be at least $500 billion short on a $43 trillion policy baseline, I believe this bill accompanied with the significant regulatory changes that are underway, and hopefully, future pro-growth oriented policies relative to trade and immigration, could have significant positive impact on the well-being of Americans and help drive additional foreign direct investment in Tennessee.   In the end, after 11 years in the Senate, I know every bill we consider is imperfect and the question becomes is our country better off with or without this piece of legislation. I think we are better off with it. I realize this is a bet on our country’s enterprising spirit, and that is a bet I am willing to make.","status",NA,NA,997,7493,247,65,27,26,344,2776

The reports have focused on the final version of the 20 percent pass-through deduction, the proposed new Section 199A. As the author of this provision and the vice chairman of the conference committee, I can speak with authority about the process by which the conference committee reached its final position. There are two false assertions contained in these reports, and I would like to correct the record on both… It takes a great deal of imagination – and likely no small amount of partisanship – to argue that a provision that has been public for over a month, debated on the floor of the House of Representatives, included in a House-passed bill, and identified by JCT as an issue requiring a compromise between conferees is somehow a covert and last-minute addition to the conference report.” Read more:","link","https://www.corker.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-list?ID=876CC4D8-DBFC-4334-88B6-FD59AF909154","corker.senate.gov",132,1359,27,7,84,5,16,361

I told him that I had a healthy respect for the media. I deal with them all the time and, you know, to attack the media has not been something I’ve done. But I had a newfound empathy for him in watching how a totally debunked story – debunked by everybody involved. Orrin Hatch, Kevin Brady, the guys that actually wrote this bill knew I had nothing whatsoever to do with it. All of a sudden, people I respect in the news media – New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post – start printing this as if it’s true and a social media phenomenon generates from this. And I hardly ever use the words “fake news”, but I actually understand what it is the president has been dealing with.  I think it’s difficult for people to understand that when you make a decision on these big, big votes, you’ve got to decide is the country better off with this or not? And you’ve got to make a decision based on all the facts you have. Look, I’ve been very concerned about deficits here in our country. I think people know that. There’s no doubt that over a $43 trillion revenue base over the next ten years there’s the possibility of a $500 billion gap. But at the end of the day, to cause our companies to be competitive around the world, to keep companies from locating in other places, to continue to build on this dynamism that we have here in our nation, I felt like this was the right thing to do.
