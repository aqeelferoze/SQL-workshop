While visiting Washington, DC, 40 migrant students from my district were subjected to comments of “beaners,"" “burritos,"" and ""wetbacks” from Inauguration attendees. One student was even spit on. Then, Donald Trump made his final cabinet selection ensuring that there would be no Hispanic representation in the cabinet for the first time in 36 years.   Mr. Trump’s repeated acts of disrespect for the 33 million Americans of Hispanic descent are historic in modern times. The hope that his actions as President would not match his political rhetoric is becoming more and more of a distant dream. One would think that an American President in the 21st Century would be dedicated to eradicating racism once and for all. However, Mr. Trump has turned a blind eye to overt racism. Indeed, in many instances, Mr. Trump himself has stirred the seeds of bigotry. This is an ominous sign for the future of the American Presidency and the United States of America.","status",NA,NA,2624,824,1733,118,12,39,532,596

Rather than truly focusing resources on deporting criminals, this executive order cruelly subjects millions of families to being ripped apart and threatens to deport undocumented individuals with no criminal record simply because they entered into this country.  Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the conservative think tank, Center for Immigration Studies, stated, ""Almost everyone who is here illegally could potentially be considered a priority.""  This absurd policy effectively lays the groundwork for the mass deportation of millions of undocumented people who are working in hotels, restaurants, construction and agricultural sites all over this country and will severely impact industries and local economies across this nation.   I despise the implementation of these unsympathetic policies and will do everything in my power to repel this offensive agenda. We are at a critical juncture in the debate as it pertains to a pathway to citizenship for the millions of non-criminal undocumented people in the United States.  Many Republicans repeatedly express compassion for the very individuals that Trump seeks to deport. But now, Republicans have a clear choice to make - either support the Trump mass deportation nightmare or stand for what is right and join us in our efforts to resist what could become one of the most historically inhumane efforts upon which our nation has ever embarked.    President Trump’s Enforcement Priorities per “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States” Executive Order:   Sec. 5.  Enforcement Priorities.  In executing faithfully the immigration laws of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) shall prioritize for removal those aliens described by the Congress in sections 212(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 235, and 237(a)(2) and (4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 1225, and 1227(a)(2) and (4)), as well as removable aliens who:  (a)  Have been convicted of any criminal offense; (b)  Have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved;  (c)  Have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense; (d)  Have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency;  (e)  Have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits; (f)  Are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or (g)  In the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.   #NoBanNoWall #WALLternativeFacts #ImmigrantsWeGetTheJobDone #ImmigrantsMakeAmericaGreat","status",NA,NA,126,60,20,11,0,3,0,15

Trump’s ill-conceived and discriminatory executive orders defy the principles upon which this great democracy was founded.

His xenophobic proclamations and disregard of Articles I, II and III of the Constitution cannot be allowed to go unchecked.  After the administration’s executive order was unanimously rejected by a federal appeals panel, Mr. Trump tweeted: “SEE YOU IN COURT!""

Trump Administration, immigrants and undocumented individuals have been indiscriminately labeled as criminals and have been slated for deportation. This deportation policy and his “Muslim” ban are despicable and extremely damaging to our core principles as a Nation. Tonight, the President has an opportunity to chart a new course. He should start by healing the wounds of our deeply divided country by unequivocally denouncing the spread of xenophobic anti-immigrant and anti-Semitic acts that have proliferated in the wake of his Electoral College victory. He should also immediately halt the indiscriminate deportation of immigrants and re-establish the economic and culturally beneficial relationship we have with Mexico.

Trump's initial Executive Order banning Muslims was ill conceived and discriminatory. In an attempt to bypass a Supreme Court of the United States reversal, The White House issued a second ""Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States"" Executive Order to “clarify” the first blatantly prejudiced Executive Order. In reality, this new Executive Order is Muslim Ban 2.0, and it once again violates both the Equal Protection Clause and the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution.    I proudly stand with Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, Massachusetts, New York and any other state that challenges this atrocious Executive Order. The State of Texas should challenge this ban as well. As a Member of Congress, I will continue to support our Constitution and fight the current Administration or anyone who overtly utilizes ethnicity, color, or creed to discriminate against innocent immigrants.

Trump's approval, is fixated on repealing the ACA—commonly known as Obamacare—to the detriment of our most vulnerable. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that 24 million people will lose health care coverage under the GOP’s American Health Care Act (AHCA). The White House's own Executive Branch analysis forecasts that 26 million people will lose coverage over the next decade.   Our health care system is not perfect, but we should strive to cover everyone, rather than the GOP’s AHCA plan to give Americans access to unaffordable, high-deductible, less-comprehensive health care. What’s particularly disturbing is the CBO’s analysis that the AHCA will disproportionally affect low-income earners, children, and the elderly by capping Medicaid and handing it over to the states.

For a party that prides itself in lowering budget deficits and taxes, the Republican Leadership’s fixation on the border wall is nonsensical.

Mexico is our ally, not our enemy. The US-Mexico economic relationship is vibrant and robust. Mexico is the United States’ third–largest trading partner and the second–largest import market for United States goods. Mexico is the number one foreign export market for goods made in the State of Texas. In my view, not only should we refrain from building additional structures dividing the two nations, but we should tear down any existing barriers.    Although I support and worked hard to ensure funding for some of the programs included in the omnibus spending bill, I believe that a vote for the omnibus bill is a vote for Trump’s wall.   In particular, I fully support provisions that expand funding for Pell Grants for college students to attend classes year round, allow our region’s shrimping industry to continue to exist, and direct the US Department of Agriculture to address the needs of the South Texas citrus industry. Unfortunately, the bill does not include the U.S. cotton industry’s cottonseed proposal, leaving the industry without a clear path forward. The livelihood of cotton farmers depends largely on the success of this program. We have spent two years working toward consensus, and the failure to include this common sense solution is exceptionally disappointing to all those who worked to resolve this issue.   United States taxpayers already spent $2.3 billion from 2007 to 2015 to construct pedestrian and vehicle fencing along the border. The fencing resulted in the division of property that belongs to U.S. citizens and the division of two partner countries, the United States and Mexico. The omnibus bill continues to squander taxpayers’ money by allocating $296 million to replace 40 miles of fencing in Arizona and California. It is telling that such a simple replacement of outdated and unnecessary fencing will come at such an exorbitant price, and begs the question, “when will the bleeding ever stop?” The fencing expense, along with the $49 million for land acquisition and border gates, represents a major land grab, which threatens the foundation of our nation’s deeply-rooted respect for the rights of private property owners. For these reasons and others, I will vote NO on the omnibus spending bill. #NoBorderWall #WallternativeFacts","status",NA,NA,155,28,13,8,0,1,0,4

Trump's retaliatory dismissal of FBI – Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey comes within a week of Comey’s request for additional resources to pursue the FBI’s investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Clearly, Trump’s rash action provides evidence that the President himself might be implicated in this treasonous scandal. Why else, in his short dismissal letter to Director Comey, would Trump insist on highlighting Comey’s three assurances that he was not under investigation? Trump is destabilizing our democracy and eroding the public trust in our law enforcement institutions. We must stop him before he makes it worse. I urge my Republican colleagues in Congress to join House Democrats in supporting H.R. 356, the ""Protecting Our Democracy Act,"" to appoint an independent special counsel to investigate Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election.","status",NA,NA,252,52,35,16,2,0,1,14

How did you become passionate about politics? I found my passion for politics when I participated in the National Hispanic Institute programs in high school. Through the programs I learned more in-depth about our government and the skills of a practicing attorney. My passion for politics grew exponentially after I earned the All-State Attorney award and the position of Supreme Court Justice at the Texas Great Debate and the Lorenzo de Zavala programs. I then became fascinated and just had to delve in some more. Since then, I constantly check the news to find out what goes on regularly in our government.   2. What is your favorite area of legislation and why? Through the internship I have done a lot of research and reports on immigration in our country, which has to be the area of legislation I am most interested in because it hits home. I grew up in Brownsville, less than a mile from the border, where I have witnessed the hardships and fears of people whose only desire is to build a better life for their familes. My knowledge and personal witness to the lives of immigrants recognizes a need to fight for them and their chance of achieving the American Dream.   3. What is one thing you wish people knew about Congress? I wish people knew how much effort, hours, and tireless work the people in the legislative branch go through daily.

Being a minority is a struggle within itself; Hispanic, female, young, but determined. I find it necessary to become educated on current issues that shape the coming generations. My passion for government stems from my small hometown, where everyone has the hope of one day going back to make a difference. It is an incredible opportunity to be placed in the middle of Capitol Hill and learn how legislation proposed here travels back to my hometown.    What is your favorite area of legislation? Why? When I first started working on The Hill I had very different interests than what my experience has now shaped. My favorite areas of legislation are foreign affairs and immigration. Growing up on a city along the United States and Mexico border I found that these areas of legislation are the most relevant in our district’s attempt to reconstruct. My experience on The Hill has encouraged me to take this idea and develop it on a more grand scale, like nation-wide security.     How would you describe your experience on The Hill so far? I have only been on The Hill for a month, but my time spent here has been one of the most impactful experiences as an academic and an individual. I have learned more about myself, and how I want to proceed with my career in the past three weeks than I have in my entire undergraduate career.

I understand Republicans want to give President Donald J. Trump one win due to his failed six months in office, but this is just irresponsible.

Download the FEMA mobile app for disaster resources, weather alerts, and safety tips, in English and in Spanish.  You may also visit the @FEMA Facebook page as well as www.fema.gov for regular updates on emergency management issues and tools and tips on how to prepare for Harvey. Visit ready.gov to enroll in @NOAA and FEMA’s innovative Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs) project, a new text-like message system, that is part of a national effort to increase emergency preparedness and build a Weather-Ready Nation.     Know your risk, take action, and be an example: The first step to becoming weather-ready is to understand the type of hazardous weather that can affect where you live and work, and how the weather could impact you and your family.  Sign up for weather alerts and check the weather forecast regularly. Make sure you and your family are prepared for severe weather.  Your family may not be together when a storm strikes, so plan how you will contact one another by developing your family communication plan.  Make sure you put together an emergency kit and store important papers and valuables in a safe place. Put together a go-bag: disaster supply kit, including a flashlight, batteries, cash, first aid supplies, medications, and copies of your critical information if you need to evacuate. If you are not in an area that is advised to evacuate and you decide to stay in your home, plan for adequate supplies in case you lose power and water for several days and you are not able to leave due to flooding or blocked roads. Once you have taken action, tell family, friends, and co-workers to do the same. Share the resources and alert systems you discovered through your social media network.  Technology today makes it easier than ever to be a good example and share the steps you took to become weather-ready.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/UsCongressmanFilemonVela/photos/a.751196664924737.1073741839.510462622331477/1641863119191416/?type=3",NA,28,2,14,0,0,0,0,0

If you are a resident of Bee, Goliad, Kleberg, Nueces, Refugio, or San Patricio County and your home has sustained damage from Hurricane Harvey, I urge you to seek a safe shelter first, and then apply for assistance with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The American Red Cross has opened 35 shelters and expects to open an additional 40 tomorrow. Download the FEMA mobile app at www.fema.gov/mobile-app to set up alerts for the latest weather updates, shelter information, disaster resources, preparedness information, and safety tips, in English and in Spanish. The app provides a customizable checklist of emergency supplies, maps of open shelters and recovery centers, disaster survival tips, and weather alerts from the National Weather Service. The app also enables users to receive push notifications reminding them to take important steps to prepare their homes and families for disasters.     To apply for assistance visit www.DisasterAssistance.gov. You may also call the registration phone number at 1-800-621-3362; those who have a speech disability or hearing loss and use TTY, should call 1-800-462-7585 directly; for those who use 711 or Video Relay Service (VRS), call 1-800-621-3362. If you have flood insurance, you will need to reach out to your local insurance agents, or call 1-800-621-3362 and select option 2.   Those who would like to assist victims of Hurricane Harvey may do so by donating or volunteering with the American Red Cross, or other organizations assisting with the situation. To donate or volunteer through the American Red Cross, visit redcross.org or call 1-800-RED CROSS or text the word REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 donation.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has more than 400 Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) personnel working to save lives in south Texas. Another 500-plus personnel are in the state and are expected to be performing rescues this evening.  National US&R teams, located across the United States, are trained and equipped to handle structural collapses and swift water rescues.  State and local officials are asking those in the impacted area to please remember:  Stay calm, do not panic.  Do not go into your attic – rescuers from the air cannot see you.  Safely seek higher ground if able to do so; get to a safe place.  Safely mark your roof to be seen by the air. To get rescuers’ attention, wave sheets, towels etc.  If you feel your life is in danger, call 911. First responders are not responding to requests for assistance received through social media, so if you cannot get through to 911 at first, keep calling.  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has also stated that if you are in need of immediate rescue you can call them at the following numbers:  281-464-4851 281-464-4852 281-464-4853 281-464-4854 281-464-4855  The Coast Guard has over 420 personnel conducting operations in south Texas, with 16 helicopters in the air and 8 more inbound.

Temporary Local Hires FEMA hires local residents, who are often disaster survivors themselves, to help their fellow citizens in the recovery process. Local hiring allows disaster survivors to get back to work while adding to the long-term recovery of the local community and bringing a special understanding of the problems faced by fellow disaster survivors. Most temporary local hires are employed following a streamlined, rather than a competitive, process. A local hire’s term of employment is 120 days, though it may be extended in 120-day increments up to one year. Temporary local hires do not earn career tenure or competitive status in the federal government. This means that they must compete with the public for future federal jobs rather than receive preference. If interested in joining FEMA as a Temporary Local Hire, applicants can search positions on FEMA’s Hurricane Workforce page. For additional information on temporary local hire positions, contact FEMA Region II, IV, or IV Office.

Over the course of a 40-year career, Latinas will be denied more than a million dollars because of the #GenderPayGap. We must all work to #CloseThePayGap now.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/UsCongressmanFilemonVela/photos/a.510602648984141.117629.510462622331477/1711859668858427/?type=3",NA,36,10,8,7,1,0,1,0

Supporters claimed that the bill would reform the tax system and provide significant tax relief for the middle class.  The reality is that the small tax cuts for individuals are paired with the loss of many important tax provisions for working families including those that promote home ownership.    Millions of American families will see their taxes go up – not down – if the Republican tax plan is signed into law.  Adding to the imbalance of the bill toward corporate interests, the tax cuts for businesses would be permanently added to the tax code while reductions in tax rates for individual taxpayers are temporary.    In their rush to provide a win for the embattled President, Congressional Republicans rammed through a tax cut bill that will increase our national debt, leaving a terrible legacy for our children and grandchildren.    I cast my vote against the Republican tax bill on behalf of South Texas working families.","status",NA,NA,327,129,38,39,4,4,3,32
