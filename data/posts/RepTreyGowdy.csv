There is no one who worked harder on tax reform than he did. Like the bill or don't, but at least acknowledge the fact he earned a spot on the center stage. He also earned an apology from the ""reporter"" who disparaged him. Look at his work, not his race.","link","http://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article190947639.html","thestate.com",21217,1468,2110,2338,43,129,246,127

Never once was a voice raised. These were interviews, not ""grillings"". Never once was the witness ""attacked"". Never once was Special Counsel Mueller ""undermined"". I've never expressed ""dissatisfaction"" with any of his answers, publicly or privately, because his answers are just that - his answers. 2016 and 2017 presented challenging and unusual fact patterns for the DOJ and FBI. It is entirely appropriate to ask questions about both the results reached and the process by which those results were reached. Deputy Director McCabe is an important fact witness. He was asked fair questions and his answers were as thorough as the venue allowed. He handled himself professionally as did the members of congress who attended. I realize none of this makes for gripping headlines about out of control inquiries, heated exchanges, subplots to undermine ongoing investigations, or casts him in a negative light. It just happens to be accurate. I was present for nearly every minute of his two interviews. Those ""reporting"" on his two interviews were not present for a single minute of either interview.","status",NA,NA,28384,3495,3381,2047,49,473,26,86
