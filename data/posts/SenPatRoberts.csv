President Trump began his Presidency meeting with our allies in the Middle East and in Asia. These discussions were the foundation for his decision to begin a new era of American foreign policy. After eight years of passive policies, last night’s action is a strong signal to these allies that America will take decisive action against bad actors. There are times the president must take action on behalf of our national security – and this was one of those times.

Since the law’s insurance mandates took effect, premiums in Kansas have doubled and insurers have exited the individual insurance market. We cannot continue to allow Obamacare to bring our healthcare system crashing down around our shoulders.  The Senate bill protects the very sick, seniors and young people. People with pre-existing conditions will keep their health care. Children under 26 remain on their parents' plans. There are no annual or lifetime limits on coverage. We reduce the deficit; we reform Medicaid, one of the big three entitlements. We eliminate the gap in coverage Obamacare created that hurt too many low-income families. We stabilize collapsing insurance markets.  It is time to put ideology aside and move. What is the alternative? Single payer, socialized medicine? The American people don’t want that. We can’t delay. Delay is higher premiums, higher co-pays and little choice. This bill is the best path to immediate relief for patients in 2018. This bill is the best possible bill under very difficult circumstances.  As debate moves forward I will work to see that rural healthcare is protected and that we achieve our ultimate goal of improving access to quality care for all Americans.  I urge Kansans to examine the Senate bill. As we await a score and then consider amendments on the floor, I welcome the feedback of Kansans.

Tax reform is especially critical to grow small and medium sized businesses which are the major job creators in Kansas.
