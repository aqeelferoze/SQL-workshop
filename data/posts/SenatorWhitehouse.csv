He conceded that we should not kick Americans under twenty-six off their parents’ insurance, re-open the dreaded prescription drug doughnut hole for seniors, deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, and reinstate lifetime limits on care.  But he has no plan to safeguard the protections we’ve gained under Obamacare.     Price also failed to reassure the Rhode Islanders I serve who rely on Medicare for their care. He has sought to replace Medicare’s robust coverage with vouchers—coupons for seniors that may or may not cover the cost of private insurance.

Every Rhode Island student deserves the chance to learn and gain the skills they need to get ahead. The mission of the U.S. Department of Education is to give them that chance. Promoting quality education for children no matter where they live requires a firm grasp of education policy and experience confronting complex issues. It requires an understanding that programs like Pell Grants, established by Rhode Island’s legendary Senator Claiborne Pell, often make higher education possible for aspiring college students. The Secretary of Education needs to understand what the Department can do to help make schools safe for all kids and how vital federal laws support children with special needs. Our Education Secretary must have this baseline knowledge and background. Mrs. DeVos’s record and testimony before the Committee show that she does not.     Moreover, the brand of ideologically driven education reform Mrs. DeVos has championed is not what Rhode Islanders want. I have received thousands of letters, calls, and emails in opposition to her nomination, many of them citing the school voucher and privatization agenda Mrs. DeVos and her allies imposed in Michigan. Rhode Island parents, teachers, and students have seen the poor results of that agenda and do not want it in our schools.     I am also deeply concerned with this nominee’s potential conflicts of interest and lack of transparency. Mrs. DeVos has failed to address these issues, despite numerous requests for information from me and other members of the Committee. We still do not know the extent of her ties to shadowy organizations designed to shield special interests from public scrutiny or whether she has disentangled herself fully from knotty investments. She needed to put these concerns to rest with thorough disclosures to us, but she hasn’t come close.   This is why Mrs. DeVos is wholly unqualified for this role and I cannot support her nomination.","status",NA,NA,2941,455,308,313,0,1,1,7

I have also listened closely to serious concerns from Rhode Islanders, who have made it plain that they fear what Jeff Sessions could do as head of the Justice Department. For every constituent of mine who has expressed support of his nomination, fifteen have expressed opposition.  Senator Sessions’s record is clear. He has fought against fixing our immigration system to keep millions of vital workers in our economy and protect families from being torn apart. He abandoned even his fellow Republicans to vote against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. He has, on numerous occasions, used racially charged or downright offensive rhetoric to belittle and marginalize broad groups of Americans, including Rhode Island’s wonderful Dominican community. He has demonstrated open hostility for bedrock civil rights laws, and failed repeatedly to distance himself from hate groups that hold him up as a champion of their values. In my questioning of him during his confirmation hearing, Senator Sessions cast doubt on whether someone with religious views that differ from his can understand the truth.

Right now, one-year-old Henry from Warwick, Rhode Island, who’s battling cystic fibrosis, can no longer be denied insurance because of his pre-existing condition. Martha from Cranston doesn’t have to worry about her son, who can stay on her insurance policy until he turns 26. Timothy from Rumford, who has a heart condition, doesn’t have to worry about hitting a lifetime limit on coverage. Catherine and her husband, who run a small business in Cranston, can finally afford quality health insurance. And seniors on Medicare, like Susan from Kingston, no longer face the ‘doughnut hole’ that forced some to choose between paying for medicine and paying the mortgage. These are just some of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act—a law that’s meant hundreds of millions of dollars in savings in Rhode Island and new-found peace of mind for so many Americans. Now Republicans, like Congressman Price, want to take away those protections.  During the confirmation process, Congressman Price had a chance to ease Rhode Islanders’ concerns about losing the reliable care and economic security they receive through the ACA and other important programs. He could have explained how the Trump Administration can build on the gains we’ve made through the Affordable Care Act.  Instead, he echoed Tea Party talking points and defended his efforts to voucherize Medicare, passing costs to seniors while eroding benefits. He wouldn’t answer simple questions about his commitment to science or the harm his own legislation may cause Rhode Islanders facing addiction or behavioral health issues. And like the rest of the Republicans in Congress, he failed to outline a realistic vision for replacing the Affordable Care Act that lowers spending and gives Americans access to the care they need. That’s why he didn’t get my vote tonight.","status",NA,NA,571,94,46,69,0,1,9,3

Allowing this nominee to scoot through the Senate without his full record before us is a plain abdication of our constitutional responsibility.   Throughout this confirmation process, it has been clear that Republicans do not want us to know about Scott Pruitt’s deep conflicts of interest. They are not interested in his dark money operation, which uses polluting industry dollars. They do not want to hear about his willingness to slap fossil fuel companies’ arguments on Oklahoma Attorney General letterhead and submit them to the EPA, no questions asked. They do not want to know about Mr. Pruitt closing his environmental enforcement division or quietly winding down litigation to protect Oklahomans from devastating water contamination.    They certainly do not want to know about the 3,000 emails between him and the fossil fuel industry that he has stonewalled for over two years. An Oklahoma judge referred to his office’s foot-dragging as an ‘abject failure to provide prompt and reasonable access to documents.’ The judge ordered them released, so we’ll start to see what he has been hiding this Tuesday.    Senator Schumer offered Leader McConnell the opportunity to vote on a different nomination today so all Senators could see what will be disclosed next week. No time would be lost in filling the President’s cabinet. But the Leader insisted on rushing Scott Pruitt through before the emails are public.   Republicans in this body have exercised willful blindness today, but they won’t be able to turn a blind eye to Pruitt’s actions as Administrator or escape responsibility for his actions. Over the last 45 years, the EPA has cleaned our water and air and protected the health of millions of Americans.

This proposal would gut programs that support jobs, education, and public health for all Americans, while handing out favors to the wealthy and big corporations. And it would abdicate American leadership in the world. It’s light on details, but it’s chock full of terrible ideas.     Taking billions of dollars away from NIH will only make it harder to find life-saving cures. Slashing the NOAA budget will take away resources from our coastal economy in Rhode Island. Cutting the IRS budget will limit our ability to crack down on tax dodgers and actually cost the federal government money. Eliminating funding for our arts and humanities agencies will hurt our cities and towns and stifle our cultural institutions. Hollowing out the EPA will leave communities at the mercy of big polluters and signal surrender in the fight against catastrophic climate change.    How exactly does allowing industrial plants to pollute our air and drinking water put America first? How does hamstringing our diplomatic corps put America first? How does pulling the rug out from scientific research and technological innovation put America first? How does kicking children out of early education or making the elderly and working families go without heat in the winter put America first?     I will oppose this senseless and irresponsible plan. I urge Republicans in Congress to work with Democrats to pass a budget that actually addresses the needs of American families and the American economy.","status",NA,NA,713,153,235,11,4,8,45,140

No matter what the fossil fuel industry and its lackeys may claim, it’s cheap natural gas that’s killing coal – not environmental protections. The Clean Power Plan is a reasonable approach to confronting our carbon problem that gives states flexibility and will save Americans on energy costs. And meeting our obligations under the Paris Climate Agreement will cement American leadership and credibility on climate change around the world.   I suspect lawyers will quickly force these agencies back on course. In the meantime, this delay and distraction serves only the fossil fuel industry and its front groups.   This ridiculous order actually puts Americans at risk. I represent Rhode Island, a downwind state prone to air pollution from out-of-state smokestacks. We are also a coastal state where rising seas driven by climate change threaten our coastal towns. For us, reducing carbon emissions and other dangerous pollution is part of preserving the state we love and protecting the health of our people.  So why tear down such important protections?  Because the most voracious and malign special interest in American politics—the fossil fuel industry—has captured the Trump Administration, installed its top henchmen at the EPA, and gone to work trying to unwind any environmental and public health safeguard that gets in the way of its profits. In fact, Administrator Pruitt, a man who built his career raising money from the industry and a former leader in the legal assault on the Clean Power Plan, was standing with the President today.    Ultimately, litigation will keep these agencies on course, but this order is a big waste of time and effort, done to appease a dirty industry and right-wing climate-denial fanatics.","status",NA,NA,453,107,156,14,1,4,53,126

He earned numerous awards and decorations, including the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal, and the Rhode Island Cross for Valor. A graduate of Harvard Law School, Armie was also an accomplished jurist. In the Guard, he served in the Judge Advocate General Corps.  He also worked in public service, as Assistant Solicitor for the City of Providence and legal counsel to multiple Rhode Island state agencies and offices, as well as to my colleague Congressman James Langevin. He eventually established his own firm, Merolla, Accetturo & Lough, where he practiced alongside two of his children until the time of his death.  Armie touched many people’s lives through his generous volunteer work in his community, from his church to the Boys and Girls Clubs to the Knights of Columbus. But perhaps his greatest achievement was raising four children with his wife of 64 years, Kitty. My thoughts and prayers are with Armie’s family in this time, as we celebrate his good works and kind spirit.","link","http://m.legacy.com/obituaries/providence/obituary.aspx?n=amedeo-c-merolla-armie&pid=185273660&referrer=0&preview=false","m.legacy.com",48,4,7,2,0,0,6,0

He seeks to decimate the federal government’s central command in the battle against the opioid crisis affecting communities from Burrillville to Westerly. He pursues tens of billions of dollars in cuts to student loans and loan forgiveness programs.   His plan would slash funding for research into life-saving cures; lay waste to endowments that support Rhode Island’s world-class cultural institutions; hamstring the EPA so big polluters can poison our air and water; and weaken NOAA, sapping critical resources for coastal economies like Rhode Island’s.

House Republicans knew this was coming, but jammed it through before the American people could see these damning numbers. The CBO’s review just confirms that this bill is a train wreck: it would impose drastic cuts and end Medicaid expansion, which has extended coverage to 70,000 Rhode Islanders; it would tear down protections for those with pre-existing conditions, returning Americans to the bad old days when an illness or injury could heap financial hardship on top of physical suffering; it would increase insurance costs for older Americans; it would make it harder for those battling addiction to find the treatment they so desperately need; and it would hamper state health insurance exchanges like Rhode Island’s, which is working, improving coverage and care for so many.

The brief calls on the Court to adopt a test for determining when hyperpartisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional.    This isn’t our first brief together. In the wake of the wretched Citizens United decision that led to the rise of unlimited, anonymous money in our elections, we filed a brief with the Supreme Court calling on it to deny a petition to review a Montana Supreme Court decision, which held that the state’s ban on corporate election spending was still constitutional following Citizens United.   These two things are related: partisan gerrymandering and unlimited spending in our politics take away power from the American voters.  John McCain and I agree it’s time to loosen the grip of special interests on our politics and give that power back to the people.

Instead, the President has set up a “Commission on Election Integrity” to investigate fabricated claims of voter fraud in the 2016 election, which he cites as the reason he lost the popular vote.   Now, this Commission, run by hand-picked appointees with pre-ordained views, has renewed its highly controversial request for sensitive voter data and is being met with bipartisan pushback from state election officials across the country. Senators have sent five congressional oversight requests seeking more information about the Commission’s work, all of which have gone unanswered.

Trump and his children called climate change ‘scientifically irrefutable’ and its consequences ‘catastrophic’ and ‘irreversible’. Yet today, Donald Trump’s fossil fuel industry lackey, Scott Pruitt, is unraveling one of the most important steps we’ve taken to combat the climate crisis. The Trump Administration is willing to cast aside its obligations under the law, and America’s position of leadership in the world, to serve the most malign and voracious special interest, the fossil fuel industry.     But today’s action isn’t the win for big polluters that Scott Pruitt and his industry string-pullers claim. The law requires EPA to act. Judges will demand the EPA protect Americans in states like Rhode Island from warming temperatures, rising seas, and the other dangers posed by climate change. They will require facts to be factual and conclusions to be logical. And they will understand that under Scott Pruitt’s leadership, fossil-fuel industry polluters have captured the agency he runs.       Congress may be bound and gagged by polluters and their dark money, but our courts and administrative agencies are not. They represent the rule of law. That means there will be a day of reckoning for dirty industry and its climate denier fringe. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-10/epa-formally-proposes-to-rescind-obama-era-clean-power-plan-j8lta11v","link","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-10/epa-formally-proposes-to-rescind-obama-era-clean-power-plan-j8lta11v","bloomberg.com",147,99,48,1,3,7,33,163

One that is particularly troubling is Michael Dourson, nominee for Assistant Administrator of the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention at the Environmental Protection Agency. Dourson took money from the tobacco industry to help them downplay the effects of tobacco. His name appears over 460 times in the now-public documents exposing the tobacco industry’s well-funded campaign to hide the truth about the dangers of it. On top of this, Dourson appears to know very little about various key issues or EPA’s perspective on them.    What’s even more troubling is that he already has a desk at the EPA. He’s serving as an “adviser to the administrator” without having been voted on here in the Senate. He could be in violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, and I find that very troubling. Today, I joined with my colleagues to ask Dr. Dourson some questions.

They haven’t reauthorized the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which covers 9 million American children and mothers. They haven’t passed the disaster relief bill that the people of Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida, and the American west need so very badly.  And, despite all the declarations and press conferences from this administration, they haven’t approved the kind of funding needed to combat the opioid epidemic raging in Rhode Island and around the country. Worse, they haven’t sat down with Democrats to try.  Then there are the Dreamers, who are rightly making their voices heard here on Capitol Hill.
