The two-state solution is at the heart of American foreign policy – and every President and every Congress since I got here – put the two state solution at the heart of what America wants for her friend, Israel. As I said on this floor on December 6, 'If we are ever going to achieve the permanent peace that allows Israel to exist without fear and Palestine to exist without occupation, we must continue to fight for the two state solution.'""  ""But under their current strongman government in Israel, all pretenses and illusions are being stripped away.  From settlements to water to restricting the Muslim call-to-prayer in Jerusalem, it seems that anything goes now in Israeli politics.

Democrats’ anger over Netanyahu’s speech has been mitigated in the past year with their wish to avoid a harmful clash with the Israeli government which would only make things more difficult for President Obama.

Congressman Gutiérrez said he was not trying to tell anyone where to shop or spend their money, but that he would not use his money to support companies that do not stand up to the bigotry coming from ""the Reality TV host in the White House"" who is damaging ""the American brand, the Statue of Liberty, and the Bald Eagle.""

Robert Mueller, the former FBI Director investigating the President will not be able to indict him no matter what he uncovers. Most legal scholars argue a sitting President cannot be indicted in criminal court.   So, it is the Judiciary Committee that will bring criminal charges if there is evidence of ‘Treason, Bribery or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors’ as provided by Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution. But here we are with evidence that the Attorney General lied to a Committee of Congress about his contacts with senior Russian officials – and lied on his security clearance application about contacts with Russian officials – officials who are suspected by our government of being covert espionage operatives, with evidence that hacking and other activities in fact took place directed by Russia…and nothing from the Judiciary Committee.

In the name of fighting crime, Republicans propose taking money away from 600-plus jurisdictions to fight crime.  They also propose Kate's Law, a bill named for Kate Steinle who was tragically killed two years ago (see my remarks in July 2015: https://youtu.be/B2S81qJqhiY), but the bill they offer would not have changed things in Kate's case.

[A similar story yesterday (en español) in Metro: Gutiérrez arremete contra Rivera Schatz por llamar “señor” a Matosantos: http://bit.ly/2tQhSUV]  SAN JUAN DAILY STAR: Gutiérrez: Rivera Schatz Expresses Homophobia of Statehood Movement http://www.sanjuanweeklypr.com/pdf/Jul-07-17/local.pdf  U.S. Rep. Luis. Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) on Thursday responded to Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz, who used the masculine pronoun “señor” repeatedly to describe Ana Matosantos, one of the female members of the federally appointed Financial Oversight and Management Board.   On Wednesday, during a radio interview with journalist Carmen Jovet on NotiUno 610 AM, Rivera Schatz used what was widely regarded as a homophobic slur from a “politician and [political] party” with a record of hostility toward the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender LGBT community, Gutiérrez charged.   “This crossed a line,” Gutiérrez said. “This wasn’t an accident or a slip of the tongue, this fits the pattern of how pro-statehooders relate to the LGBT community -- namely: with hostility and homophobia. What matters is that one of the most senior leaders of the Puerto Rican government thinks it is OK to talk this way and it reveals a lot about the conservative politics of the pro-statehood movement. Making fun of someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity is never okay -- in Puerto Rico or anywhere else. I am the last one to support anything the oversight board is up to, but homophobic remarks? That is beneath the dignity even of the statehooders and makes President Trump look mature and well-adjusted by comparison.”   Congressman Gutiérrez recently spoke on the federal House floor to warn his fellow Democrats that statehooders in Puerto Rico are not political allies.   Gutiérrez has been fighting in Congress against the imposition of the Financial Oversight and Management Board of which Matosantos is a member. The eight-member oversight board was put in place as part of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), Congressional legislation passed in 2016 to help the island government tackle its massive public debt burden and begin to reverse Puerto Rico’s economic decline. Matosantos was an appointee nominated by Democrats in Congress.   Late last month, Gutiérrez spoke on the House fl oor about the June 11 plebiscite in Puerto Rico, where 97 percent of the voters supported statehood, but only 23 percent of the voters “actually took the time to vote.”   He warned Democrats that “those who are peddling the fantasy of statehood sometimes call themselves Democrats, but we should all beware of an elephant in donkey clothing.”   Gutiérrez conceded, sarcastically, that the 97 percent result was “pretty impressive,” but said the results represent “the kind of numbers that would make Vladimir Putin jealous and Saddam Hussein green with envy if he were not so dead.”   “And the reason why the statehooders got 97 percent of the vote was pretty much the same reason as those guys too: only one political party participated,” Gutiérrez said. “All the other parties thought the election was so rigged and so pre-determined for the outcome the sponsors wanted that it was not even worth taking part. And the vast majority of Puerto Ricans agreed. Only 23 percent of the people voted. Seventy-seven percent thought it was not worth their time to participate in what was basically an elaborate publicity stunt for the ruling party. And they were absolutely right.”   Gutiérrez noted that Resident Commissioner Jenniff er González ran on the statehood party ticket, is a Republican and “a proud supporter of Donald Trump,” and that the head of the governor’s offi ce in Washington is a Republican operative who ran the “’Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles,’ infamous for its constant bashing of President Obama.”   “So instead of spending money to help children whose schools are closing, or fi x roads that are falling apart, or pay doctors enough to prevent them from moving to Florida, it seems the entire Puerto Rican government is now dedicated to pursuing the unlikely chance of statehood,” Gutiérrez said. “It is certainly useful as a distraction from what the governor and his DC operatives are actually doing.”   The U.S. Congressman, who was born in Chicago to parents who were migrants from Puerto Rico, has lived, worked and gone to school in Puerto Rico at various times in his life.   “I have said before and will say again, I plan to be buried on the beautiful island of Puerto Rico some day and I hope that when that happens, I will be in a free and sovereign nation that has thrown off the yoke of colonialism and dependence on an overseas master, just as this country -- the country of my birth -- has done,” Gutiérrez said.   “In the meantime, I think it is important to warn my fellow Democrats that they should no more get in bed with the statehooders than with any other group of right-wing conservatives with an agenda.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepGutierrez/photos/a.481704813204.267861.91052833204/10155493527978205/?type=3",NA,166,9,19,8,0,2,0,2

If we continue to ignore or further restrict our immigration system -- by making visas almost impossible to get, turning asylum seekers around against the law, and threatening to deport parents if their child is in immigration detention -- we will see more tragedies like the one in Texas as we force migrants into the black market rather than giving them a way to come legally.

There is no doubt the American people stand with the young people who face deportation if Republicans kill DACA or fail to defend it in court.  The people with DACA are 800,000 young men and women who are now doctors and lawyers and raising their own families.  They are not criminals, they are assets to the United States and should not be driven out or driven underground.  Another 300,000 or so people have been living and working here legally with TPS for decades and it now appears the President is actually contemplating making over 1 million documented immigrants into undocumented immigrants.   ""I am a citizen and know when I leave my house in the morning that I will return that night, but millions of immigrants leave for work or school each day unsure whether they will be arrested and detained.  I gave up a few hours of my freedom to stand up for them.  I think as the reality of mass deportation, of ending DACA or ending TPS, as that sinks in and becomes more palpable for people, we will see an escalation of non-violent protest across the country.   ""It is a shame and an embarrassment – es una vergüenza – the way this White House has turned on immigrants and fomented animosity towards immigrant families.  I was at Navy Pier in Chicago on August 15, 2012 when immigrant youth and their families lined up to be the first to sign up for DACA.  It was a moment of great hope as families helped fill out the paperwork knowing that only their children would actually benefit from DACA.  I didn’t think I would be back in front of the White House facing arrest to defend DACA just five years later.""","link","http://bit.ly/2uMREA8","bit.ly",1360,77,212,167,5,37,129,24

If Trump does kill DACA, it will be a huge mistake based on a series of lies and half-truths.  A good analysis of some of the false arguments being deployed by Trump and others is in this article by America's Voice: http://bit.ly/2eIeP8y  THEY MIGHT SAY: DACA is unconstitutional. We were forced to end it.    WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS: Despite the long history of presidents of both parties implementing similar policies, and thedeep well of legal analysis proving DACA is legal, does anyone really believe this President and his team have conducted a careful constitutional analysis about the extent of executive authority to reach this decision? Greg Sargent of the Washington Post obliterates this notion in a powerful piece. With tongue in cheek, he writes. “It is a truly shocking coincidence that the same advisers who are telling Trump that DACA is unconstitutional were also the ones most responsible for the disguised Muslim ban and also pushed Trump to pardon Joe Arpaio.”  THEY MIGHT SAY: We’re doing this to focus on criminals.    WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS: If talk of MS-13 and “bad hombres” is scary, maybe Americans won’t notice that this Administration is actually going after the easy targets – young people who are going to college, starting businesses, paying taxes and using their educations to grow the economy; immigrants who are complying with ICE orders of supervision and showing up at ICE offices for “check-ins;” and immigrants who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are arrested as “collaterals.”","link","http://bit.ly/2eIeP8y","bit.ly",850,107,324,18,3,25,213,106

He could be moving the bipartisan DREAM Act forward, but instead, he wants to make it very clear that Republicans see Latinos and immigrants as a threat to the U.S., not an asset.  Hundreds of thousands of doctors, teachers, nurses and soldiers are going to be yanked from the American economy if Speaker Ryan does not allow the DREAM Act to go forward in the next few weeks, but his priority is feeding red meat to the anti-immigration wing of his party and satisfy them with a big helping of ‘let’s label Latino youth as machete wielding menaces.’”  This is not a bill to curtail violence or make the country safer, it is a political bill to allow Republicans in the House to make speeches about urging Americans to fear young immigrants.  ""It is clear that Democrats and Republicans would prefer to be talking about the DREAM Act and showing the country that we can act in a bipartisan manner to resolve the status of DACA recipients and other immigrants who were raised in the U.S.  I am committed to not exchanging the safety of DREAMers for more deportations or further restricting legal immigration so that there are no available legal avenues for immigrants who help feed us, build our communities and serve our country.  But the priorities of House Republicans seem inconsistent with what their American people, the majority of House Members and their own voters want them to do.""

The Mayor announced that 22 Chicago firefighters are going to Puerto Rico to help with the rescue and recovery efforts, including bringing equipment that may help make communications to remote parts of the Island easier.  He also announced that the City of Chicago has an updated list of organizations to which Chicagoans can make donations, whether it is for Hurricane Maria, Irma, Harvey or the earthquake in Mexico: https://www.cityofchicago.org/disasterrelief   In Chicago, we want to be for Puerto Rico what Houston was for New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina -- a place of refuge where we will help you get settled, get your kids in school, get you medical care and make you feel welcome.  In Chicago and the rest of the U.S. we need to start thinking about evacuation in addition to rebuilding and recovery.    I have welcomed family into my own home and Puerto Ricans I know across the country are welcoming or preparing to welcome relatives escaping Puerto Rico (and the Virgin Islands), but we need to ramp up our commitment beyond the family to family ad hoc resettlement that is already taking place and see how we can organize ourselves to meet the great need of the Puerto Rican people.  Having just returned from Puerto Rico, I can testify that things are worse than you think, even though some progress is being made.  2 News Articles:  Mayor: Chicago welcomes Puerto Ricans fleeing their destroyed homes (Chicago Sun-Times): http://bit.ly/2fLnpHi  Emanuel outlines Chicago hurricane aid for Puerto Rico (Chicago Tribune): http://trib.in/2fLQ6nD","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepGutierrez/photos/a.481704813204.267861.91052833204/10155758375403205/?type=3",NA,330,23,82,42,0,0,10,0

Any decision the President makes one day is likely to be completely reversed another, depending on which extremist advisor he is listening to that day.  The one thing Trump has demonstrated consistently is how comfortable he is denigrating immigrants and Latinos, questioning the legitimacy of our very citizenship in the U.S., and standing up for and defending white supremacist policies – and returning to the anti-immigrant well over and over.  Democrats and the rest of the country would be crazy to take seriously this set of principles or the President who is proposing them.   The goal of the President’s approach to immigration seems to be to criminalize and deport as many immigrants and Latinos as he can by outlawing whole categories of legal immigration, pushing young people with DACA back into the black market, and making it easier to label law-abiding immigrants as criminals so that he can deport them.  The 800,000 DACA recipients who could lose protection from deportation have come forward and gone through multiple background checks, arrived here as children, and have lived here for a minimum of ten years.  We should be incorporating and integrating them further, not threatening them or their families with deportation to play to the anti-immigration wing of the President’s political base.  There is bipartisan support in Congress to get this done, and the votes are there. Those serious about solutions need to keep going and deliver what vast majority of Americans support.  Now after a few weeks of delay, we know once again that it is up to Republican congressional leaders to decide if they are serious about moving forward and if they will let the majority in the House of Representatives who support the DREAM Act to have a vote and protect DREAMers before the deportations ramp up further.","link","http://bit.ly/2xtn4Ru","bit.ly",222,30,33,11,0,4,35,5

She writes:  Perhaps if you cannot read it on the floor you can call a press conference and read it.   “Puerto Ricans have suffered greatly in the past month. Two hurricanes devastated our homes and our electrical infrastructure leaving us without the essentials to survive: drinkable water, food and medicine. But perhaps more frustrating has been the devastating actions, time after time, by a President whose tweets, comments and actions seem to be taken out of a book on “how to add insult to injury” rather than a book on “how to help during a humanitarian crisis”. He is simply incapable of understanding the contributions, the sacrifices and the commitment to democratic values that Puerto Ricans have shown over decades. His actions are unbecoming of a leader of the free world.    Mr President, you seem to want to disregard the moral imperative that your administration has been unable to fulfill. Your replacement of the FEMA Coordinator in Puerto Rico is an admission that things are not going the way they should. Your tweets and comments just show desperation and underscore the inadequacy of your government’s response to this humanitarian crisis. It is not that you do not get it, it is that you are incapable of empathy and frankly simply cannot get the job done.    Ever since this ordeal began, San Juan has had over 300 sustained volunteers from the United States. Good, hard working people from New York, Florida, California, Texas and many others who embody the fundamental values of compassion, ingenuity and hard work that you are certainly unable to express. These men and women, most of them union workers, have literally taken care of our bodies and souls. They did not come for a photo op or to throw paper towels and insults at us. They came to help, something you seem to be unable to grasp. These volunteers have seen the horror that you continue to want to dismiss. They embody the true spirit of the American values that you dismiss with every inappropriate and derogatory action and comment.    Tweet away your hate to mask your administration’s mishandling of this humanitarian crisis. While you are amusing yourself throwing paper towels at us, your compatriots and the world are sending love and help our way. Condemn us to a slow death of non drinkable water, lack of food, lack of medicine while you keep others eager to help from reaching us since they face the impediment of the Jones Act.    I ask every American that has love, and not hate in their hearts, to stand with Puerto Rico and let this President know we WILL NOT BE LEFT TO DIE. I ask the United Nations, UNICEF and the world to stand with the people of Puerto Rico and stop the genocide that will result from the lack of appropriate action of a President that just does not get it because he has been incapable of looking in our eyes and seeing the pride that burns fiercely in our hearts and souls.    No one needs an invitation to help, to feed the hungry, to cure the sick, to give a helping hand to those in need. Simply put: HELP US. WITHOUT ROBUST and CONSISTENT HELP WE WILL DIE.    Mr. President fulfill your moral imperative towards the people of Puerto Rico.”    Carmen Yulin Cruz  Mayor of San Juan  October 12, 2017","status",NA,NA,665,84,804,134,1,17,257,14

Excerpt: I doubt if any of these people are even aware there is a debate on the U.S. mainland about whether the people of Puerto Rico are doing enough to help themselves recover from Hurricane Maria, a conversation that presumes everyone is in a position to help themselves more than they have already.  I met them in the hillside communities not far from the capital of San Juan, but just far enough to make them virtually invisible to the official hurricane recovery efforts.  In the hills, it was mostly up to local residents to clear the debris left by the hurricane.  They piled it beside the roads — heaps of mattresses, trees, building materials, clothing — and that’s where it remains, collecting rainwater and stewing in the tropical heat.  “This is where the system is failing, up in the hills,” said Carmelo Rios, a former professional baseball player and criminal lawyer who now is the Senate majority leader in Puerto Rico.  “This is where it falls off the grid,” Rios said.","link","http://bit.ly/2yCk2tJ","bit.ly",132,20,107,1,0,3,92,28

Gutierrez met a woman with a severely handicapped adult son whose home had been trashed in the storm.  Suddenly, she began sobbing, explaining that all she wanted was a mattress for her son to replace the rain-damaged one they’d had to throw out.

Ella hablo sobre la grave situación en Puerto Rico y dijo que este no es el momento de jugar a la política, no es momento para atacar a los trabajadores puertorriqueños o a los sindicatos y que especialmente no es el momento para permitir que conexiones políticas determinen a quien se le pagan enormes contratos para ayudar con la recuperación de Puerto Rico. La Alcaldesa es una de las mejores embajadoras para la gente de Puerto Rico en Washington y es una héroe para muchos de nosotros en el partido Demócrata y a través de todos los Estados Unidos.    El Congresista  Joe Crowley, Presidente del Caucus Demócrata, quien organizó la reunión y conferencia de prensa, es un verdadero campeón para Puerto Rico y los puertorriqueños. El Congresista Bennie Thompson, el demócrata de más alto rango en el Comité de Seguridad Nacional, que supervisa a FEMA, también estuvo con nosotros como el verdadero amigo de Puerto Rico que es.  Mis colegas Adriano Espaillat (NY) y Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ) también nos acompañaron.   Durante mis comentarios, aproveche la oportunidad para darles las gracias a los Líderes Demócratas quienes le dieron la bienvenida a la alcaldesa esta mañana porque, en mi opinión, ella es una mujer latina fuerte que se ha tomado la responsabilidad de exponer las verdades de la crisis en Puerto Rico y que ha sido atacada por levantar su voz. A veces, creo que a los hombres en Washington no les gusta ser desafiados por una mujer y mis colegas del Caucus Demócrata están en solidaridad con la alcaldesa y quieren dejarle saber a ella – y también a la gente de Puerto Rico – que estamos haciendo todo lo posible para asegurar que el salvar vidas y ayudar a los habitantes de Puerto Rico sea una prioridad.   This morning I spoke at a press conference with Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz Soto of San Juan after she met with Democratic Members of Congress at our weekly Democratic Caucus meeting.    She discussed the very serious situation in Puerto Rico and said now is not a time to play politics, not a time to attack unions or Puerto Rican workers, and not a time to allow political connections to determine who gets paid huge contracts to help Puerto Rico recover.  The Mayor is one of the best ambassadors for the Puerto Rican people in Washington and is a hero to many of us in the Democratic Party and across the United States.    Rep. Joe Crowley, the Chairman of the Democratic Caucus hosted the meeting and the press conference afterwards and is a true champion for Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans.  Rep. Bennie Thompson, the highest ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee which oversees FEMA, was also there and is being a true friend to Puerto Rico.  My colleagues Adriano Espaillat (NY) and Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ) also joined us.  During my remarks I took time to thank the Democratic Leaders who had welcomed the Mayor this morning because in my opinion, here you have a strong woman of color who has stood up to tell the truth about the crisis in Puerto Rico and she has been attacked for opening her mouth.  Sometimes, I think the men in Washington don’t like to be challenged by a woman and my colleagues in the Democratic Caucus are standing with the Mayor to let her know – and let the people of Puerto Rico know – that we are making saving lives and helping the people of Puerto Rico a top priority.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepGutierrez/photos/a.481704813204.267861.91052833204/10155844505998205/?type=3",NA,299,43,51,27,0,1,5,1

It sounds like Republicans and the President are reneging on that plan and all the promises we had from the White House to work towards passage of a bill to protect DREAMers from deportation are out the window.  You simply cannot make a deal with Donald Trump and expect him to hold up his end of the bargain two months, two weeks or two minutes later.    I have been clear from the beginning that if Republicans think they can pass a Republican-only spending package to keep the government open in December, they should do so.  They control all branches of government and both houses of Congress and don’t need a single Democratic vote if they are unified.  However, we all know the Republicans are not unified and always need Democratic votes to pass big spending packages and keep the government open.  They lost 90 of their own guys in the House last time.  If the Republicans need Democratic votes to pass their spending package in early December, House Democrats will insist that it include a clean DREAM Act to legalize immigrants made vulnerable by President Trump killing DACA.  More and more, I think Democrats are coalescing around the idea of forcing Republicans to give us a vote on DREAM if they want our help passing anything else this year.  Democrats will bring 190-plus votes and there are at least 35 Republicans who support legalization for immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children.  That is enough to pass the DREAM Act tomorrow if the Speaker calls the vote.  Messing around with that majority by adding unrelated cuts to legal immigration or ramping up border militarization and deportations will weaken support for the bill and it will be rejected by Democrats.  When the American people favor legal status for DREAMers by a 4 to 1 margin, maybe Republicans should stop stonewalling and allow the majority in the House to pass the DREAM Act.","link","http://bit.ly/2lKOehk","bit.ly",93,26,21,7,1,2,16,4

He is expected to terminate TPS for everyone in the coming months.  Below is a press statement from me in reaction.  The full text is here: http://bit.ly/2hORPGI  ""The President does not have a mandate to turn documented immigrants into undocumented immigrants so that it is easier to deport them, yet by terminating TPS and the DACA (the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program, that is exactly what he is doing.  He is uprooting millions of lives that have been established in the United States, families that are deeply ingrained in American communities, businesses that help our economy and working men and women who contribute to our success.  It is an avoidable tragedy that the President is inflicting on our nation.  ""Our goal for immigration should be to have a system where people can come legally with visas instead of smugglers and where we fully incorporate immigrants who already live here and have deep roots in the U.S. into our society so that everyone is playing by a clear, permanent, and enforceable set of rules.  That is not the direction Donald Trump is taking us in when he eliminates legal status for immigrants already here and proposes deep cuts to legal immigration for anyone coming in the future.  The President’s approach leads to greater illegality, less control, more chaos and tremendous hardship for families that call the United States their home.  ""‘Blood and soil’ immigration policies taken straight from the White Supremacist playbook are coming into clear view as the President hurdles down the nativist road towards a walled-off America.  For hundreds of thousands of American citizens with parents and other family members with TPS, this President is aggressively trying to destroy their families, end their American dreams and cleanse American communities of their continued presence.  The cost of electing a President with deep-seated animosity towards Latinos and immigrants is becoming more real – and more tragic – every day.""","link","http://bit.ly/2hORPGI","bit.ly",253,67,166,3,1,29,189,188

That is unacceptable.  ""I don’t trust this Administration as far as I can throw the White House and all its occupants.  They feel they have a mandate to turn documented immigrants into undocumented immigrants so they can deport more people.  Killing the DACA program and ending TPS (Temporary Protected Status) are examples of how they are trying to increase the ranks of deportable people.  And in the case of DACA, there is no appeals process or accountability for USCIS or Homeland Security.  So these young people who played by the rules have no recourse.  ""You cannot trust Donald Trump to keep his word and you cannot appeal to his sense of decency because it doesn’t exist.  The fact is we have dozens of people who did everything right and are still getting nothing, And estimates are that another 22,000 eligible DACA recipients did not beat the application deadline, which means people are already losing their DACA status well before the March 5, 2018 cutoff.

Steve Cohen is leading this effort and so far, six Democrats have signed on.  Today, Rep. Cohen and I were joined by Rep. Al Green and Rep. Adriano Espaillat.  The press release my office put out today: Gutiérrez Joins Effort to Impeach the President | Congressman Luis Gutierrez http://bit.ly/2hzY8AT which includes the following (excerpt):  I am not joining this effort because of his sustained anti-Latino bias.  He started his campaign calling Mexican immigrants murderers and rapists.  He does not think that an American-born judge with a Spanish sounding last name is legitimate, just as he does not believe that Latinos voting is legitimate.  And I think he is taking the country in exactly the wrong direction on immigration by taking documented immigrants and making them undocumented so that he can deport them...  ...What elevates certain actions to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors are the following examples.  President Trump asked the Vice President and others to leave the room so that he could have a private one-on-one conversation with FBI Director Jim Comey to tell him to back off of the Russia investigation.  You do not ask witnesses to leave the room unless you know you are committing a crime and in this case it was obstruction of justice.  The President once said “It’s very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it,” and he has kept his word on that promise, by continuing to line his pockets with money and to drive business to his brands using the public office of President.  That’s not right and that’s not legal.  I think the ongoing investigations will uncover even more instances where the President has violated the law and violated the public’s trust and I am glad those investigations are still moving forward, despite, in some instances, attempts by the President to slow them down or derail them.  This is not a substitute for the investigations that should and will go forward.  But the Congress needs to get started.  The U.S. Congress, and specifically the Judiciary Committee on which I sit with Steve Cohen, is the place where impeachment starts and if we failed to file these articles of impeachment, we would be failing at doing our jobs.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepGutierrez/videos/10155882949233205/",NA,1955,411,623,379,22,49,4,17

See: https://www.uscis.gov/news/alerts/uscis-guidance-daca-renewal-requests-affected-mail-service-issues You can read about it in the NY Times story below.    Today, Dem Caucus Chair Joe Crowley and I and colleagues Adriano Espaillat and Raja Krishnamoorthi issued a press release, which you can read here: http://bit.ly/2j2zuWb  Excerpt: This decision comes after House Democrats, led by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley (D-NY) and Reps. Luis V. Gutiérrez (D-Ill.), Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), publicly condemned the Trump administration’s initial decision to reject these applications as unnecessary, heartless, and unproductive.   “Accepting the applications of DACA recipients who sent in their renewals on time is the right thing to do,” said Chairman Crowley. “The DACA program gave sanctuary to nearly one million young men and women, and the Department of Homeland Security should have never held them hostage due to the errors of the U.S. Postal Service.”  Congressman Gutiérrez said, “This is about getting Americans into the system and on the books so that they can live and work in the only country they have ever known, so it makes no sense to deny young people the ability to live and work in the United States, especially when they applied and paid for it and did everything right.”","link","http://nyti.ms/2zJ9dpX","nyti.ms",222,15,39,26,1,2,1,0

Later today, the Congressman will speak at a massive rally in Upper Senate Park to advocates who are gathering to send the same message: Pass the DREAM Act now.  Yesterday, 34 House Republicans wrote Speaker of the House Paul Ryan to ask him to allow a vote on legislation to protect DREAMers and those with DACA before the end of the year.  Rep. Gutiérrez says “You take the 34 Republicans that wrote the Speaker and add them to 194 of my Democrats and you are comfortably in the majority and the DREAM Act passes.”  Before the end of this week, a Continuing Resolution (CR) to fund the government past the midnight deadline for funding on Friday will be voted on and Rep. Gutiérrez and others are calling for the inclusion of the DREAM Act on this must-pass legislation, because DREAMers with DACA are already losing their protection from deportation.  “Every day that Congress does not pass the DREAM Act, 122 DACA recipients lose their protection from deportation,” the Congressman said in his floor speech.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepGutierrez/videos/10155945364408205/",NA,929,39,171,141,0,4,3,2

I am proud of the Dems in the House who are standing up  and standing together for the DREAM Act, but I do not confidence that our counterparts in the Senate will stand up and keep fighting for DREAmers. So we have keep working to get them to fight in January.  I wish we all were fighting harder now because people are losing their DACA status right now and we cannot wait.

Chuck Schumer in a last minute appeal for the Dream Act before we leave town.  I am very proud of my colleagues (list below) and I think we had a good, frank discussion with the Senator.  We did not change the outcome of the day, which is that the Dream Act will not be passed today or this year.  But I believe Democrats are on the same page and set up well for a resumed fight in January when the budget and spending issues will be reopened.  We cannot wait for the Dream Act because Dreamers with DACA are losing their status, losing their jobs, and we fear, some are losing hope.  But the CHC is committed and ready to keep fighting.  Joining Sen. Schumer were the following CHC Members: Filemon Vela (TX), Vicente Gonzalez (TX), Lou Correa (CA), Juan Vargas (CA), Salud Carbajal (CA), Ben Ray Lujan (NM), Raul Grijalva (AZ), Joaquin Castro (TX), Darren Soto (FL), Ruben Gallego (AZ), Jimmy Gomez (CA), Albio Sires (NJ), Tony Cardenas (CA), Adriano Espaillat (NY), Nanette Barragán (CA) and our Chairwomen and leader, Michelle Lujan Grisham (NM).","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepGutierrez/photos/a.481704813204.267861.91052833204/10155988659773205/?type=3",NA,793,47,71,91,2,2,15,2

He is a skillful manipulator of fear, anxiety and grievances — aided by a dedicated set of nativist henchmen inside and outside his administration.  This is a tremendously sad story for America’s future filled with a deep skepticism of American exceptionalism and a fierce doubt in what our country is — and should be — about.  But everyone should read this very sad story, because Trump and his tribe are only just getting started.  This should keep us all motivated to keep resisting in the New Year.","link","https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/us/politics/trump-immigration.html?emc=edit_ta_20171223&nl=top-stories&nlid=19100444&ref=headline&referer","mobile.nytimes.com",161,16,43,1,0,2,18,24
