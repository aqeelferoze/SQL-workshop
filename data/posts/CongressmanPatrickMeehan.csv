There are some things to like in this budget. It includes $500 million in additional funding to combat the opioid crisis. It adds funding for veterans’ health care. It also includes good news for the workers at Boeing’s facility in Delaware County: it replaces a V-22 Osprey lost in combat in Yemen earlier this year.  But I also have some serious concerns. It reduces funding for the National Institutes of Health. It includes significant cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, which may hamper its ability to protect our air and drinking water. And it cuts federal protection for national parks and federal lands by 75 percent, which could endanger conservation efforts in Pennsylvania at sites like Gettysburg National Military Park.  Ultimately, I expect Congress will take the White House’s request into consideration – but the Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse. As the budget process continues, I’ll keep on fighting to ensure we’re both making good use of taxpayer dollars and funding the services and programs important to Pennsylvania families.","status",NA,NA,97,261,11,0,0,0,3,3

But I also expressed serious concerns about just what this bill would have meant for Pennsylvania.   This legislation didn’t go far enough to bring down the cost of care or make essential coverage more affordable. Ultimately, this bill was not a satisfactory repeal of Obamacare, nor an adequate replacement.   But this issue isn’t going away.

It will put more resources in the hands of those on the front lines of the fight against opioid addiction in Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania is set to receive the fourth-largest federal grant awarded, following only California, Texas and Florida.  I'm pleased to see Pennsylvania receive such a significant share of funding -- but it's also a somber recognition of the fact that our communities have been hit particularly hard by this epidemic.","status",NA,NA,76,33,8,3,0,0,0,0

I hear from constituents every day who face higher costs for less coverage. There’s no question Obamacare is unsustainable.But this legislation doesn’t keep the promises I made to my constituents when I said I would do it.  It threatens people with pre-existing conditions with skyrocketing costs. It threatens essential healthcare coverage like mental health and opioid addiction treatments. Monthly premiums for many, particularly older Americans nearing retirement, will rise. This bill doesn’t repeal or fix Obamacare – it simply shifts its failures from one group of Americans to another.  Even after major changes to the legislation, the House voted today without the benefit of a CBO score that will tell us how much it costs or what it may mean for coverage. It’s the product of the same broken process and last-minute deal-making that gave us Obamacare.  Now the bill goes to the Senate, where the bill will likely see significant revision. I hope that those changes address the concerns I have and that I’m able to support a final repeal-and-replace bill.","status",NA,NA,432,408,62,22,0,0,3,29

The Paris Agreement isn’t perfect. But by abandoning it, America is relinquishing that seat at the table. It calls into question our commitment to protecting and preserving the environment. And it forfeits our ability to drive countries like China and India to reduce their carbon footprint and compete on a level playing field. Ultimately, this disappointing decision diminishes America’s leadership role on the world stage.","status",NA,NA,510,159,46,28,2,2,6,39
