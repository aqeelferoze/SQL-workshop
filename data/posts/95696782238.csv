While it is easy to be dismayed at the lack of progress in resolving this conflict, a permanent solution can only be reached through direct and bilateral negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Unfortunately, when the United Nations and its bodies support biased resolutions like this one, it only encourages the Palestinians to further avoid dialogue.   UNSCR 2334 is highly problematic. It fails to recognize Israel as a Jewish democratic state, while assigning all blame for the conflict on the Israeli government despite Israel’s repeated offers for peace. Even more troubling, the resolution defines all of East Jerusalem as a settlement, making no distinction between Jerusalem and remote outposts as settlement areas. This shows just how little the United Nations understands about the conflict. At the end of the day, UNSCR 2334 does nothing to improve the lives of the Palestinian people.    The Security Council does not have the right to adjudicate Israel, the only thriving democratic nation in a region engulfed in turmoil. This resolution should have never been brought up for a vote, and the United States should have used its veto authority rather than abstaining.   In the previous Congress, I introduced a resolution urging President Obama and Secretary Kerry to use the United States’ veto power on anti-Israel measures. I am proud to have co-sponsored this resolution, which objects to UNSCR 2334 and urges serious, direct negotiations between the parties.","status",NA,NA,31,7,5,4,0,0,0,0

First, in the rush to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Republicans announced that their budget will explode the deficit to more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. After years of reductions by the Obama administration, this reversal would increase the national debt to $29.1 trillion by 2026. Some Republicans are describing the increases in spending as technicalities, but such a tremendous increase in our nation’s debt will be anything but a technicality to millions of hardworking Americans.   Secondly, in addition to working to drastically increase our national debt, Republicans have wasted no time and announced their plan to completely defund Planned Parenthood as they began their assault on women’s rights and health. Planned Parenthood has spent decades increasing women’s access to much needed health care services and must be supported and protected.  Finally, three Republican senators introduced legislation that would cut security funds for U.S. embassies around the world in half. In fiscal years 2018 and 2019, it would cut off all security, construction, and maintenance funding worldwide, except to pay for moving the Israeli embassy to Jerusalem. Such an action will put every U.S. embassy around the world at risk, proving once and for all that Republicans’ interest in the Benghazi attack was nothing but a political stunt.   Now that the Republicans control the government, they are showing their true colors.

I condemn these acts of hate and pledge to continue doing my part to combat intolerance.   As we observe International #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we must do more to fight back against bigotry. Blind hatred has no place in our world, and each of us has the responsibility to make our own communities safer, more tolerant places.","status",NA,NA,70,12,18,6,0,0,13,1

Today, National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day continues to serve as a valuable mobilization effort encouraging African Americans to be aware, be informed, and to get treated.    Unfortunately, what was true last year and in years prior remains true today: HIV/AIDS affects African Americans more than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States.  While African Americans represent only 12 percent of the population, they account for almost 45 percent of new HIV diagnoses each year.  Of those new diagnoses, an estimated 57 percent are gay or bisexual men, or men who have sex with men (MSM). And of that group, 39 percent are young men aged 13 to 24. Despite this harsh reality, I am committed to ending this pandemic once and for all.   Thanks to medical advances, people are living longer and healthier lives, but there is still much to be done in order to meet our goal of zero new infections and zero new deaths.

When he came before Congress for his first joint session, he presented a vision of an America for all.   Four weeks into his administration, President Trump has presented no jobs bill, no plan for healthcare, and has offered nothing to improve the lives of everyday Americans. Instead, he has elevated a white supremacist to the National Security Council and been caught pressuring the FBI to undermine an investigation of the Administration’s ties to Russian intelligence. This is, quite simply, unacceptable.   Throughout the past week, concerned Americans attended town halls across the country. And for those who were actually able to meet with their Republican Representative in Congress, the conversations focused on protecting healthcare, creating jobs, and protecting the environment. They did not ask for fewer workplace protections, nor did they ask Congress to make it easier for people with severe mental illnesses to purchase guns. They did not ask Congress to undermine retirement security or ease disclosure requirements for oil companies making payments to foreign governments.

Their plan would kick millions of Americans off their health insurance and force millions more to pay higher premiums. It would take healthcare away from the poor, give tax cuts to the rich, and pull the rug out from under seniors, families, and children.   Truly, this plan is so bad that Republicans literally hid the proposal from the public, at the same time refusing to discuss or share the bill with Democrats and callously brushing off the pleas from Americans supportive of the ACA. Even as the uninsured rate has fallen substantially, Republicans continue to ignore the benefits of the ACA in order to placate their political base.   I am reminded today of President Obama’s healthcare summit with Congressional leaders seven years ago. For nearly eight hours, Republicans in attendance rose, one-at-a-time, to reject the proposal in its entirety without offering any ideas for moving forward together. Since then, the Republican Party has obstructed the ACA for political reasons, harming countless Americans in the process in order to appeal to the fringe members of their party.

Many died while protecting their classmates and colleagues, barricading doors or even attempting to stop the gunman. Heroes like Liviu Librescu, a survivor of the Holocaust, sacrificed their lives so that students and instructors alike could live. The stories from this tragedy are haunting.  On this solemn day, as we mourn those who were lost, we must also recognize that not enough has changed in the wake of this tragedy and dozens of others. A national cry for improved gun control has fallen on too many deaf ears. We know that something needs to change to prevent future tragedies, yet this change has not come. Today is a day of remembrance, but it is not enough to simply remember. We must honor the past by looking to the future and continuing to fight for commonsense progress that will curtail gun violence.  Nearly 35,000 Americans die every year from guns. We cannot simply accept this as part of America.","status",NA,NA,27,4,4,4,0,0,13,0

Israel’s story is no less remarkable today as it was when it was founded 69 years ago. Rising from the ashes of one of the greatest human catastrophes the world has ever witnessed, the people of Israel have built a modern, thriving nation. From the high-tech hub of Tel Aviv to the cultural center of Jerusalem, the State of Israel stands out as an example of democracy in a region often marred by violence and oppression. No other country has lived with such constant challenges to its right to exist, yet despite these challenges, Israel has flourished.   Too often, Israel is unfairly targeted on the world stage. As we see a resurgence of anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism, including efforts to boycott, divest, or otherwise isolate Israel, it is more important than ever that we continue to stand with our Israeli allies.   Today, the United States and Israel work together in a number of areas, including energy, medical research, high-tech and innovation, academia, and more. Through partnerships such as the Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) Foundation and BIRD Energy, our countries work hand in hand to advance  research and development cooperation in the private sector for the benefit of all.

The American people deserve to know what President Trump is asking of their sons and daughters. In that regards, the President’s address was unacceptably vague. By refusing to detail the number of troops he will deploy or the missions they will be tasked with, the President has positioned himself to drag out our nation’s longest military conflict indefinitely, in sharp contrast to his statements on the campaign trail.    Further, in openly declaring the end of American-led democracy building, President Trump has doubled down on his administration’s abdication of leadership across the globe. As the Ranking Democratic Member of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, I have long championed democracy and human rights reforms in nations making the difficult transition towards free and open societies. In announcing this decision, President Trump has given authoritarian despots tacit approval to continue abusing and violating the rights of their citizens with impunity.    This address underscores the importance of passing a new AUMF dictating a clear and coherent strategy for American military engagements in Afghanistan. Congress has the constitutional authority to lead this conversation, yet for too long has ceded this immense responsibility.

More importantly, this decision tells the more than 800,000 DACA recipients that they are neither valued nor wanted, while in truth, they are invaluable.     DACA recipients are here in search of the American dream: to better their education and to make a better life for themselves and their families. Casting them aside as lawbreakers or criminals is reprehensible.    In February, President Trump pledged to address DREAMERs and immigration reform ‘with heart.’ He promised that he would ‘take care of everybody.’ Just last week, Vice President Pence reiterated that the President would act with ‘big heart’ to ensure that undocumented immigrants benefiting from DACA would be treated fairly. Regrettably, we have been reminded once again just how heartless this President is.   President Trump’s about-face means that Congress must get to work at once to protect DREAMERs. My Republican colleagues now have a choice: stand with their President, or stand with their country.

Our veterans exemplify the very best of our nation, oftentimes serving in dangerous conflicts around the globe in defense of American security. The fact that our Armed Forces are comprised entirely of volunteers underscores the importance of recognizing the sacrifices that come with this service and sets the example for other countries around the world.   We have an obligation to care for service members both when they’re abroad and when they come home. Rates of veteran suicide remain disproportionately high, and many of the three million Americans who have served in Afghanistan and Iraq have Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or depression. Congress must prioritize addressing these issues, just as it must ensure that veterans or their eligible family members have access to the educational benefits they are entitled to. We must work collaboratively to guarantee that our veterans maintain access to affordable housing and education, employment opportunities, healthcare and mental health services.    As we celebrate Veterans Day, let us honor those men and women who have defended our country. If you see a veteran today, take a moment to thank them for their service to our nation.","status",NA,NA,51,8,3,7,0,0,0,1

This is just the latest step in uncovering the degree to which the Trump Administration colluded with the Russian government. The fact that Michael Flynn is the fourth Trump campaign official to be charged in connection with Special Counsel Robert Muller’s investigation is profoundly telling.

To deny the Jewish connection to Jerusalem would be to deny world history. That being said, the manner in which the Trump Administration has announced its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is of great concern.   In the context of peace negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the sensitivity of the status of Jerusalem cannot be overstated. The ramifications of this decision could be profound, and I fear that the President made his decision based on political expediency rather than sound foreign policy.   The United States has long held that the final status of Jerusalem should be determined as part of an agreement negotiated between the State of Israel and the Palestinian leadership. The President’s announcement undercuts this position, as well as the role of the United States as an honest mediator of the conflict.   This announcement puts the security of American embassies and consulates throughout the Arab world at risk. The United States should continue to support a two-state solution that provides for peace, security, and mutual recognition for both the Israeli and Palestinian people.   Earlier this year, I introduced H.Res.393, a resolution supporting a concurrent track approach to the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process and commending those Arab states that have courageously improved their relations with Israel. I believe this is the best approach to move this process forward, while recognizing the rights of both the Israeli and Palestinian people.  In light of the President’s decision, I call on his Administration and the international community to re-engage in a serious diplomatic effort with the Government of #Israel and the Palestinian leadership to advance the peace process, including a negotiated agreement on the final status of Jerusalem.","link","https://alceehastings.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398913","alceehastings.house.gov",53,59,17,7,6,0,1,2

Five years after this incomprehensible act of violence, my heart is still broken for the families that lost children, the teachers who gave their lives protecting their students, and the Newtown community. No words will ever replace the sense of loss or the emptiness that remains.  The sorrow that I feel when reflecting on this anniversary is amplified by the fact that more than 170,000 gun-related deaths have happened since Sandy Hook. Gun violence remains an everyday facet in America, and it seems as if no amount of grief, frustration, or anger can remove this seemingly indelible stain from our country. Another 30,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns in the coming year. I refuse to believe this is simply the cost we must pay for being American.  For too long, Members of Congress beholden to the gun lobby have hidden behind the second amendment, refusing to take any action to curb the gun violence epidemic. That we have not acted in any way whatsoever to protect our citizens is insanity personified. This is on Congress, and Congress must act.
