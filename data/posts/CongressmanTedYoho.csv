Yesterday, I, along with my colleagues in the House, took the first step in making that promise a reality.   Six years after its enactment, Obamacare – the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - has given Americans skyrocketing premiums, soaring deductibles, loss of their preferred doctor and plan, and few options.  Insurers are withdrawing from markets across the country, leaving many families with fewer choices and less access to care than they had before. This is the complete opposite of what the law promised. This law has been a failure and is collapsing under its own weight.   We live in a free Constitutional Republic where everyone can choose the life they want for themselves and their families. This includes health care.  The repeal of the ACA prevents the Federal Government from mandating how we live our lives and overseeing what health care we can and cannot have.  No more can they fine you for not doing what they dictate.  This repeal and replacement will benefit all Americans and is a win for personal liberty.  From this point forward, House Republicans are going to fulfill the promise to replace this disastrous law with patient-centered health care. Health care that increases access to quality care, focuses on lowering costs, and gives the American people more power in their health care decisions.","status",NA,NA,174,67,25,20,0,1,0,9

President Trump, by issuing his executive order on Friday, illustrated his strong stance and commitment to making sure the federal government adheres to its primary function to provide for the common defense of our nation.  It was a move that I support.  The manner in which he implemented his executive order is being debated by armchair quarterbacks and in editorials.   The thing to remember is that leadership requires decisive action.  Following eight years of very little enforcement or leadership from the previous administration, and their failure to tackle a tough issue, I welcome this move. Also, keep in mind that the previous administration suspended the Cuban wet foot dry foot policy with no advanced warning; yet, I heard no protest.  Let's keep political agendas that divide us out of national security issues.  The text of this order does not single out any religious faith. The countries named in the executive order were previously identified by the Obama administration as ‘countries of concern.’ This temporary suspension will enable certain agencies time to implement security enhancements that will improve many of the vetting programs.  I fully support thorough vetting of individuals who seek to enter the United States from countries that do not have the ability to adequately provide documentation for their own nationals.  This temporary suspension will serve America well and will not prevent properly vetted individuals from entering the US. It is possible to protect our homeland from individuals who wish to do us harm, all the while allowing individuals who are fleeing persecution and guided by the light of liberty entrance into the United States.

This bipartisan bill expands Post-9/11 GI Benefits to include internship opportunities targeted at small businesses and manufacturing.   The new program would offer veterans the option to receive their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit as a stipend to complete a career transition internship with a qualifying business. The bill requires special consideration be paid to sectors most affected by the economy’s growing skills gap, such as manufacturing and small business.

The Promoting Tourism to Enhance our Economy Act will allow Canadian citizens who are at least 55 years old and own a secondary residence in the United States to visit the country for 240 days (8 months); current law only allows for 180 days (6 months).   Tourism is a vital industry in Florida, and many Canadian citizens have vacation properties or rentals in our state. This contributes a great deal to the economy in Florida. This sensible legislation will ensure that our friends to the north are able to extend their stay in the U.S. for two additional months without any additional costs to American taxpayers.   Canada is one of America’s closest allies and her citizens contribute millions of dollars to the U.S. economy. This bill will provide an incentive for additional tourism from Canada in the future and will strengthen the bond between our two nations.","status",NA,NA,82,25,8,4,1,1,1,1

I appreciate the passion and thoughtfulness you expressed, and want you to know that you were a crucial part of the legislative process in making your voice heard. I received 3280 phone calls – 215 in favor and 3,059 against. After careful thought and consideration, I decided that I could not support the American Health Care Act (AHCA).    Today’s decision to postpone the vote on the AHCA was the right move. The bill that was presented to the House was not the correct vehicle at this time for a full, effective repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), a.k.a. Obamacare. It was a good first start, but the bill did not go far enough. The bill made changes to the existing law but didn’t remove the framework of Obamacare.    Our goal to bring down skyrocketing premiums and repeal government-run healthcare with a more patient-centered system remains the same.  We have an opportunity going forward to continue crafting a bill that gets healthcare right for all Americans.    There is no one on Capitol Hill that wishes to pull the rug out from anyone or leave them without healthcare. Further, after reading the AHCA, I felt it did not accomplish what I was sent to Washington to do. Voters sent me to Congress to repeal Obamacare 100 percent and to fix our healthcare system. However, this bill left in place a framework of Obamacare that lasted at least until 2020. With that in place, any future Congress could re-implement federal mandates, subsidies, and control of our personal insurance.  The AHCA created an unsustainable system of federal advanceable refundable tax credits for health insurance purchases. It did not repeal all of the ACA’s insurance regulations that drive up premiums. It did not ensure coverage would be adequately priced for elderly patients. Finally, the AHCA still would not have contained costs but would have kept government mandates requiring coverage that people do not want, need, or should pay for.    In the future, repeal of the ACA will come, and healthcare in America will be fixed. Our goal is to make sure all Americans have access to quality health care that is affordable. We need a healthcare system that allows free markets to work between patients and their doctors, not big government mandating what type of coverage you have to buy or making important health decisions for you. My commitment to my constituents remains the same: to repeal Obamacare and repair healthcare in America.","status",NA,NA,314,284,64,26,2,4,2,16

Through targeted, secondary sanctions on foreign companies that continue to do business with Pyongyang, we can hit Kim Jong-un where it hurts most: the wallet. Kim relies on these funds for his illicit nuclear and missile programs, and we must use every tool we have to deny him the hard currency he needs.

It left too many of Obamacare’s heavy-handed regulations intact. Those regulations, while superficially appealing, in reality, are the main drivers of high premiums and the ongoing collapse of the Obamacare exchange system. Allowing states to obtain waivers from the federal mandates governing essential health benefits, age rating, and health status underwriting, while ensuring that the state will protect those with pre-existing conditions, is a prudent and significant first step towards replacing the ACA in full. That is why I support the improved AHCA.  The amendment that was added to AHCA, and one I support, will grant states the ability to waive several of the cost-driving requirements of Obamacare that were totally left in place under the original draft of AHCA. Further, the amendment requires states that obtain waivers from the health underwriting regulations to have a program in place that will keep insurance affordable for people with pre-existing conditions who haven’t maintained “continuous coverage” such as a high risk pool. These reforms will reduce premiums and start stabilizing the individual insurance markets while preserving coverage accessibility. I am also an original cosponsor of a measure introduced by Rep. Martha McSally (AZ-2) that ensures Members of Congress and congressional staffs are not treated differently than anyone else under the waiver provisions when the AHCA is signed into law. I am happy that conservatives held their ground in asking for additional relief for those suffering under Obamacare as it stands.  It has always been my priority to vote for legislation that lowers health care costs and provides greater access to quality care for hardworking families. After a lot of discussion and meetings between multiple members, this bill was the best option for us to reach those goals.  I understand this bill does not realize my desire for a 100 percent repeal of Obamacare, but it is a large move in the right direction to fix the ACA’s many faults.   This is not the bill I would have introduced myself, but as a Member of Congress, I am prepared to do what is needed to govern. The Framers brilliantly created governing institutions that require consensus on lawmaking, and the amended AHCA is a product of just such a consensus.  If we did not pass the AHCA, Obamacare would remain a permanent fixture for all future Americans which cannot be allowed to happen.    For over 8 years we have heard from the American people that they do not want Obamacare. In my district, they have overwhelmingly called for an end to Obamacare. I was sent to Washington by those individuals with that primary goal in mind. This vote is a reflection of that goal--it isn’t mission accomplished by any means--but it’s a good start.  What I am very pleased about - with the amended AHCA - is that it moves health care policy from a top-down, centrally-planned disaster under Obamacare to a system that embraces federalism and allows for individuals to make decisions more freely. The AHCA ends Obamacare’s penalties for non-compliance with the individual and employer mandates, repeals Obamacare’s taxes, allows states to institute work requirements for able-bodied Medicaid recipients, and expands the allowable size of HSAs for high-deductible insurance plans. That being said, I will continue to press House Leadership and the President to finish the job. It is still the spring of 2017--we are just getting started on repealing Obamacare in full.  The “world’s greatest deliberative body” has been fully aware of our debates and discussions in the House- indeed, Senators and their staff were part of the discussions on this bill- and so they need to seriously engage on this bill as their first priority.   With this vote, I am voting for a process. We have a responsibility here in the House to move the chains and get the legislative ball in the red zone. This bill is about 80% of a full repeal package, and we need the Senate to finish the job. I urge my colleagues in the other chamber to improve upon the work that we have done in the House. Only with both chambers advancing the cause can we realize the goal of repealing and replacing the government expanding, liberty-destroying Affordable Care Act.","status",NA,NA,211,422,43,8,0,0,6,217

You may have heard some people pointing fingers at the House-passed American Health Care Act. They wouldn’t want you to see this report. But the proof is in the pudding: Obamacare is to blame.  Here’s the report by the numbers:  39: All 39 states using healthcare.gov saw an increase in individual market premiums since 2013.  105%: The percent individual market premiums have increased since that time. In other words, premiums have more than doubled.   $2,928: The staggering average annual premium increase since Obamacare mandates and regulations went into effect. Ouch.  3: Three states saw premiums not double, but triple since 2013.  223%: The percent increase in premium costs Alabama residents experienced!

JAXPORT, Florida’s largest container port, is designated by the Department of Defense as vital to national security and is strategically positioned to accommodate a wide range of global shipping. These mega-sized container ships require a deep draft in order to ship efficiently and cost effectively.   The completion of this project will create 15,000 US jobs, have a $24 dollar return for every $1 invested, and will improve the shipping industry of Florida.   JAXPORT is vitally important to Florida’s economy. It supports $26.9 billion in economic output, creates 132,000 jobs, and generates $727 million in state and local taxes - $169 million of which are directly from cargo operations.  The completion of this project at JAXPORT will create good paying jobs and drive economic growth for the region, the state, and the nation.","status",NA,NA,95,27,25,1,0,0,0,0

While Memorial Day is a day of quiet reflection and remembrance, it is also a day to give thanks. It is a day to be thankful that we live in a country that is free and filled with citizens who will answer the call to defend liberty.  It is a day not only to honor our fallen military but to say thank you to all who are actively serving to protect us at home and abroad.   Since 1868, Americans have celebrated what was once called “Decoration Day” to honor the fallen. Every year since then we have honored those who fell at Gettysburg, at San Juan Hill, in the Argonne forest, on the shores of Normandy and Guadalcanal, at Inchon, at la Drang, in the desert at Objective Norfolk, on the streets of Fallujah, and in Zabul Province.   Generations of Americans have fought to preserve the great privilege of freedom that we must never take for granted. We owe these patriots a debt that can never be repaid, but that must be remembered always, not just on Memorial Day.  As with every Memorial Day, I will be observing a moment of silence at 3 pm. Please join me in paying respect to our heroes who fell in defense of the freedom and liberty we enjoy every day.  And please pray for those who have served, and for those who are currently serving in harm’s way.

This bill will make foreign aid more efficient and effective by establishing a direct relationship between U.S. development agencies and the private sector.   It also requires consultation with the private sector when developing country strategies and calls for ongoing studies into the factors that limit private-sector growth in each country that receives U.S. assistance.   America is the most generous nation in the world when it comes to foreign aid. EGDA will ensure that our foreign aid dollars are used effectively and efficiently. By focusing on these objectives, we can transition recipient countries from aid to trade with the United States.   I want to thank Rep. Adam Smith for joining me in introducing this bill.  I would also like to thank Senator Isakson for introducing his companion bill (S.1274) in the Senate as well as his co-leads, Senators Coons and Perdue.

Today, that bipartisan bill was signed into law by the president.   The bill improves the care our veterans receive and so richly deserve. After hearing the stories of mismanagement in the VA and the testimonials from veterans in our district, I am confident the bipartisan bill we passed will improve the VA.  It will do so by streamlining the complicated process of removing, demoting or suspending VA employees for poor performance or misconduct. It also ensures that whistleblowers within the VA, who shine a light on any misconduct, are protected from retaliation.  Today is a victory for veterans and their families. It is also a positive example of what can be achieved when both Republicans and Democrats come together for our veterans and the common good.","status",NA,NA,93,16,11,6,0,0,0,1

I was impressed with the clarity of his mission, his desire to give our military the tools they need, and the decision to remove the bureaucratic restraints placed upon the military by the Obama Administration.   Ideally and constitutionally we shouldn’t be involved in any country or engage in nation building.  However, due to the failures of previous administrations, there isn’t an easy way to remove ourselves from Afghanistan without it becoming a haven for terrorists.     I agree with the president that we must hold governments accountable, bring them to the table, and collectively eliminate individuals who engage in terrorist acts against humanity.  His statement was clear and direct, we do not have unlimited resources, and we will not write a blank check for others security. We will meet countries at their level of commitment.  We will not tolerate other countries duplicitous rhetoric which says they are fighting terrorism, while at the same time they are harboring terrorist networks within their borders (e.g., Pakistan and Afghanistan).  President Trump made it very clear that you are either with us or against us.  Those nations need to come to the table and do their part to stabilize their own countries. They need to pick up the baton and work with us to create the type of country that works best for their people.  He was right to put Pakistan and Afghanistan on notice and send a message to terrorists that we are coming for them.  In Donald Trump, we have a commander in chief in the White House that will do what is necessary to rid the U.S. and the world of radical terrorists. President Trump’s speech last night showed leadership that has been lacking in recent years and demonstrated that he will use the tools necessary to end these atrocities plaguing the civilized world.","status",NA,NA,302,140,23,29,13,0,2,42

For decades Washington has failed to address our broken immigration system. For too long Washington has looked the other way and not enforced the existing laws on the books and it has created a complete mess. President Obama’s actions were an abuse of his executive authority and went around the legislative branch. Congress writes the laws, and it is the Executive Branch’s duty to make sure they are faithfully executed.  For those who came to the United States as children and to no fault of their own, I support a window of time for them to come forward and identify themselves without fear of deportation. I support providing a way for Dreamers who have registered under DACA with DHS to obtain legal status. Such legislation should go hand-in-hand with measures that reduce illegal immigration.  Congress now has six months to work collectively on a legislative solution that will fix this problem and shield Dreamers from deportation.

Here is my full statement as well as some additional information about what all was snuck in the bill.  “Today, the House of Representatives was presented with a bad bill with no alternatives. This should have been a clean bill on disaster funding - the same bill that I voted in favor of earlier this week. No gimmicks, no add-ons, just funding for Harvey victims. Instead the Senate added an unconscionable debt limit increase and a continuing resolution they knew wouldn’t pass on their own. Snaking in a debt ceiling increase with funding for victims and communities affected is immoral and reflective of broken leadership in Washington.  “I do not think it wise to extend our borrowing limit without mandatory spending reforms. I do not think its good governance to kick the can down the road with yet another continuing resolution which continues to compromise our national security. Because of these issues, I voted NO on final passage.  “If this was a clean measure that focused on those affected by Hurricane Harvey, I would have proudly voted for it. But the Senate decided to play politics yet again and I will not stand for that. I will not compromise my values and principles shared by my constituents to award a Washington that uses political manipulation and crisis exploitation as a means to an end.  “Rest assured that relief will be provided to the victims of these hurricanes.   Senate amendment to House amendment to Senate amendment to H.R. 601, READ Act, hurricane supplemental, debt limit, continuing appropriations, and flood insurance package  This bill: Suspends the debt limit through December 8, 2017 with no spending reforms Provides a Continuing Resolution (CR) through December 8, 2017 with no reforms and forces the military to operate under a stopgap CR, once again. CR’s do enormous, lasting damage to the American military.  We are witnessing an alarming increase in accidents, growing evidence of a force under stress, and an eroding technological position when compared with our adversaries.  Not only does this bill fail to remedy those problems, it makes them worse. Provides $15.5 billion in emergency disaster funding Reauthorizes the National Flood Insurance Program through December 8, 2017 with no reforms. $7.4 billion for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program that was not requested by the Administration. CDBG is fraught with wasteful spending and isn’t really used for timely disaster relief. Pesticide fee extensions, among many, many other “anomalies” Formally establishes federal programs to support the education of girls and vulnerable children in developing countries.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanTedYoho/photos/a.607664815926167.159260.563532937006022/2130529396973027/?type=3",NA,88,62,20,4,1,1,2,15

Upon receiving weather reports late today, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) announced that it is actively monitoring a small bridge on I-75 at mile marker 408 crossing the Santa Fe River on the northern border of Alachua County. The river is expected to crest at historic and unprecedented levels presenting a potential threat to the safety of travel on this bridge. The Santa Fe River under I-75 has rapidly risen 15 feet within the past 36 hours due to the heavy rainfall over North Florida from Hurricane Irma. An additional rise is expected within the coming days as water levels from upstream move southward down the river. The river level is currently safe at 55 feet. However, if the river were to rise to an unsafe level, the bridge would become impassable both northbound and southbound, and would be closed immediately.  If the Sante Fe River rises to an unsafe level, it will require the full closure of I-75 south of I-10 and north of U.S. 441 in Alachua. Travelers should be prepared for significant delays from tomorrow evening through Saturday. This unprecedented river flooding will also cause closures and extensive rerouting of traffic on U.S. 27, U.S. 41, S.R. 47 and possibly U.S. 121. These routes would not be considered passable.   If you are traveling southbound, please plan on an alternate routes!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanTedYoho/photos/a.607664815926167.159260.563532937006022/2137370542955579/?type=3",NA,29,11,112,0,0,10,0,0

Today’s ceremony solidifies Taiwan’s commitment to purchase 360 million bushels of U.S. grain at an estimated value of more than $2.8 billion.  The United States and Taiwan enjoy a strong economic relationship that benefits both our countries. On a recent Congressional Delegation trip, I had the pleasure of meeting Taiwan’s Minister of Agriculture Lin Tsung-Hsien. During our visit, we had an important discussion on how best to increase the volume of U.S. agricultural exports to Taiwan. Today, I am excited that we have the opportunity to increase U.S. agricultural exports to Taiwan in a way that is beneficial to both the American farmer and the people of Taiwan.  While U.S. grain is an important and major export of the United States, our fruits, vegetables, and livestock industries are also unparalleled. My home district of north central Florida alone can grow a wide variety of quality produce while still producing specialty products such as blueberries and Wagyu beef.    To help deliver quality American agriculture products to Taiwan, we need to continue engagement through the U.S.-Taiwan Trade and Investment Framework Agreement. In addition to that important framework, we must continue working with organizations like the Taiwan Agricultural Trade Mission and local programs such as the Fresh From Florida program.    By using all these avenues of commerce, I am confident that American farmers, and particularly those in Florida, can meet Taiwan’s demand for quality agricultural products","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanTedYoho/photos/a.607664815926167.159260.563532937006022/2137837066242260/?type=3",NA,31,5,8,4,1,0,0,0

Please share with friends and family in Puerto Rico!   Gov. Scott: Florida Virtual School to Accept 20,000 Displaced Puerto Rican Students    SOUTHPORT, Fla. – Today, Governor Rick Scott announced that Florida Virtual School (FLVS) will accept 20,000 Puerto Rican students who were impacted by Hurricane Maria to ensure they are able to continue their education. Whether students are still in Puerto Rico or in Florida, they can take advantage of this program.   Governor Scott said, “Families in Puerto Rico have experienced extreme devastation of their homes and communities due to Hurricane Maria. As they work to rebuild their lives, these families should not have to worry about their children falling behind in school. In Florida, our schools offer a world-class education, and I am glad that Florida Virtual School has stepped up to help these families as they rebuild their lives. I encourage Puerto Rican families to take advantage of this opportunity and the State of Florida will continue to do all we can to help them during this challenging time.”   Displaced Puerto Rican families who are interested in signing up for Florida Virtual School should contact Liz Chico at (863) 606-8033.  Additionally, all Florida school districts are prepared to accept displaced K-12 students in local schools, and a number of districts have already begun enrolling displaced students. Families who would like to enroll a student in a local elementary, middle or high school should contact the school district in which they are located. Contact information for each district is posted here.  http://www.fadss.org/membership/superintendents","link","http://www.fadss.org/membership/superintendents","fadss.org",82,23,42,8,1,1,0,7

Manufacturing plays a major factor in making Florida among the nation’s top states for conducting business. Our great state produces a wide variety of goods including aerospace products, batteries, food and beverages, communications equipment, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, boats and more.  Florida currently is the18th largest economy in the world, worth $839 billion. To continue building on our success, we need to get  Washington D.C. out of the way. Too often, job creation falls victim to over-regulation and red-tape. Small businesses are uniquely affected by the burden of over-regulation, and we must create an atmosphere of certainty and stability for all job creators.   By implementing tax reform, we can unleash Florida’s economic potential. Yesterday, I voted in support of H.Con.Res.71, a budget resolution for the United States Government for the fiscal year 2018. This budget resolution sets appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2019 through 2027. This will enable us to implement a tax plan that will unleash the economic engines of this country and Florida. A fairer tax system will bring higher economic growth, bigger paychecks for our manufacturing and small business sectors, and increased opportunities for every American.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanTedYoho/photos/a.607664815926167.159260.563532937006022/2170707406288559/?type=3",NA,48,28,4,0,0,2,0,1

Antifa, a so-called “anti-fascist” group comprised of radical Marxists and anarchists, is calling on its supporters to come and protest Richard Spencer, advocating violence and chaos in the process.    In our constitutional republic, both sides have a right-and what I feel is a privilege-to espouse their views as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution.  The First Amendment gives individuals the right to free speech, peaceful assembly and protest to promote one's views.  People must be serious about exercising these rights respectfully.  You cannot have freedom without responsibility.  Hate groups and groups that promote violence and anarchy have no place in our society.  They simply have a self-serving agenda and feed off mob-like participation and divisiveness.  When Richard Spencer comes to Gainesville, I want to ask that all people of differing viewpoints take responsibility for themselves and the groups they have invited to attend the event.  It is estimated that this event will cost the University of Florida hundreds of thousands of dollars and Alachua County will have to mobilize hundreds of law enforcement officers, EMT's, firefighters and paramedics at a cost not yet determined but paid for by the taxpayers of the county.    While these groups exercise their right of free speech and to peaceably assemble, I hope they will have respect for each other's rights to express their own points of view, and that all will agree to disagree peacefully.  Let's hope they keep in mind the many first responders that are taking time away from their families and at great cost to Alachua County taxpayers for the protection of all parties.    Let's hope these groups take responsibility for their members and that there is no violent behavior. However, if people do engage in violence, I will press state and federal prosecutors to bring charges against malefactors to the fullest extent permitted by law.  As for me, I refuse to be anywhere near this event because Richard Spencer and Antifa’s viewpoints are both morally repugnant. I choose not to offer either of them an audience.

This vote takes us one step closer to meaningful tax reform that will benefit all Americans and our economy. I want to thank Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and the full committee staff for all their hard work and heavy lifting.   House Republicans’ goals for reforming our tax code have always been straightforward: simplify a very complicated tax system, allow working families to keep more of their hard-earned money, stimulate the economy and create jobs. I believe these are goals that everyone can agree on.   Today’s vote is part of a process to produce a final bill to be sent to the president. The legislation that passed today is not law.  Now that the House has passed our version of tax reform, we wait for the Senate to pass their version during the next few weeks. Once we have a Senate version, both bills will go to conference, and all differences will be resolved before a final vote.  I am a taxpayer, a father of three, and a former small business owner. I believe individuals and families know how best to spend their hard earned money, not the federal government. The tax code should enable businesses to expand and grow our economy, and should not be a hurdle for them to jump over or work around. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a good faith effort to relieve the tax burden on American families and create a system that will stimulate our economy. Today we are one step closer to making this a reality.","status",NA,NA,274,306,20,18,3,1,9,174

The redesignation of North Korea as a State Sponsor of Terror is an overdue and essential measure in the peaceful international pressure campaign against Kim Jong-un’s pariah regime. In March of this year, I requested this same course of action to Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson. I also introduced legislation to create oversight on delisting a country from the SSOT. This will make sure the current and future administrations will have to consult with Congress before formally delisting a country from the SSOT.  North Korea’s consistent record of facilitating terror is beyond dispute, from the callous murder of American college student Otto Warmbier to the use of a banned chemical weapon to assassinate Kim’s half-brother to sales of arms to terrorist groups around the world.  Duly labeling North Korea a State Sponsor of Terror will reiterate to the globe that Kim’s nefarious activities have no place in the civilized world, further discouraging intercourse with this dangerous regime. Thae Yong-ho, the highest-ranking North Korea defector in decades, told me during his testimony before the Foreign Affairs Committee that this redesignation will help keep up the pressure on Kim.

Jon is a partner at the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell and he represents both technology companies and broadband providers.   The FTC is the country’s strongest antitrust cop and is the federal agency with the best expertise in fighting illegal anti-competitive business behavior. So, I agree with Mr. Leibowitz's opinion that this week’s action by the FCC was the right thing to do. Whatever your opinion is on this issue, I hope you find this piece informative.
