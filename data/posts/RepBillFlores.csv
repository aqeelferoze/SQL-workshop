Just think about what it means to make our current weaknesses public – this information would essentially provide a “roadmap” for criminals and terrorists to achieve refugee status; thus putting them in a position to harm our families and our country.  I cannot and will not be a part of putting our nation at risk by disclosing the weaknesses of our currently flawed vetting process.    While we are on the subject of refugee vetting, several folks have posted that our current vetting system takes a lot of time and involves numerous steps – it does.  That said, when it comes to national security, the length of time and the number of boxes checked in a process should not be used as yardsticks to measure either quality or effectiveness.  Our system is flawed, our nation’s Intelligence and our Homeland Security agencies know this and they are counting on Congress and the Trump administration to correct these issues.  President Trump’s short-term delay in the refugee program gives us a chance to do this.  Under our Constitution, the number one responsibility of the federal government is to protect our country.  I take this responsibility seriously and I will not ever bow to any political pressure in this regard.  Some of you have been critical of me for exercising this Constitutional responsibility; I am disappointed that you feel that way, however, I will not waver.

This timing allows constituents to receive an overview of the House-passed federal budget, the document which best sets forth the policy visions of the House. In addition, the timing of these events allows a tangible discussion of the first 100 days of the 115th Congress and the Trump administration.
