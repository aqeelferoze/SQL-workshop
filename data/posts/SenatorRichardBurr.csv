On September 11, 2001, our nation was attacked by extremists who sought to strike fear into the the heart of America and free people across the world.  We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the brave men and women who put their lives on the line and brought the fight to the terrorists and those who harbor them. Every day, our bravest work to ensure that such a heinous crime will never happen again, and rest assured, we will #NeverForget.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorRichardBurr/videos/10155610155839360/",NA,302,73,51,25,1,2,41,1

This bill will update and simplify our incredibly complex tax system so that every-day, middle-class Americans can keep more of their hard-earned dollars. For instance, the typical family of four making the median family income will save nearly $1,500. The standard deduction also nearly doubles for individuals and families, and the child tax credit is significantly expanded. By bringing money back from overseas and encouraging entrepreneurship and small business again, we will finally be able to unleash our economy and get the country back on track. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate Finance Committee, as well as the House Ways and Means Committee, to put together a bill through an open process that will bring much-needed relief to millions of Americans.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorRichardBurr/videos/10155762931099360/",NA,559,1621,110,41,118,9,27,862
