Today’s defeat of this disastrous legislation, which would have cost both in-terms higher premiums and less coverage, is a victory for children, families, individuals with disabilities and older Americans, but the fight to protect and enhance affordable care continues.  We always said the Affordable Care Act was a start, not a finish.  House Republicans have had seven years to add constructive alternatives to make the Affordable Health Care Act work better.  This bill didn’t come close.  It was rejected by the American people and Congress and we are all better off.","status",NA,NA,348,55,14,29,0,0,0,6

During World War II, Captain Cole's aircraft was struck by enemy fire during a storm. He made sure his copilot could parachute safely to friendly territory, but in doing so, his own departure from the aircraft was delayed. He landed behind enemy lines where he was shot, captured, and assigned to a POW camp run by Hitler Youth. At one point he only weighed 95 lbs, but served as an example of exemplary conduct while in enemy custody. Captain Cole attended Fosdick-Masten Park High School, now known as City Honors School, but enlisted in the service before graduation. Today he was inducted into the school's hall of fame, and was presented with his high school diploma. Captain Cole's incredible story shows the lasting effect one person can have on the world and reminds us of the bravery and sacrifice of those who fought for our freedoms. http://higgins.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-higgins-presents-military-service-medals-to-102-year-old","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBrianHiggins/photos/a.10154197544616441.1073741860.88144056440/10154197545066441/?type=3",NA,87,6,16,9,0,0,0,0

We should be capitalizing on our unique architecture and investing in our historic but forgotten neighborhoods.  Instead this is a decision to invest millions of dollars in the status quo – another station almost exactly where Exchange Street sits now, just on the opposite side of the tracks under a highway overpass - not the forward-thinking, bold vision this community deserves.    This decision was not based on what train riders want, what Canalside visitors want or what the people of Western New York want, because they overwhelmingly support the Central Terminal.  In fact, 87.9% of public comments submitted to the train station selection committee favored the Central Terminal. This should have been a decision by Buffalo and for Buffalo.  We don’t take up fights because they are easy, we fight for what’s right.

We are witnessing a dangerous and dismissive attitude toward some people as less accepted and less valued than others.  This display of intolerance is hurtful to individuals and the noble principles that genuinely make our nation great.   I am proud to call Buffalo -- the ‘City of Good Neighbors’ -- my home.  As a country and as humans we could all benefit from being more neighborly.  Each of us face our own struggles but they are better overcome when we are united rather than divided.  Each of us bring our own strengths as individuals but we are wise to recognize we are significantly stronger together.    Genuine leadership doesn’t embolden hate; instead, it should promote kindness and understanding.  These exhausting distractions tear us apart, preventing us from working together and making real progress. We need less confrontation and more collaboration, fewer outbursts and more outcomes, and less heat and more light.","status",NA,NA,551,98,70,90,7,0,0,3

The even greater fear is that this is just the beginning.
