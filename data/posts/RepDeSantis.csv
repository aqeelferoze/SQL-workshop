As a judge on the federal 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and in his extrajudicial writing, Gorsuch has demonstrated a strong grasp of the Constitution, exhibited an interpretive approach similar to that of Justice Scalia and Justice Clarence Thomas, and showcased top-notch writing skills.  He has impeccable academic credentials and was unanimously confirmed by the Senate to his current position in 2007.  If you created a nominee from scratch with the goal of filling Scalia's large shoes, such a nominee would look a lot like Neil Gorsuch.  At the same time, being strong on paper tells a lot but it doesn't tell everything.  Perhaps the most important quality for a constitutionalist Supreme Court justice is something that Scalia demonstrated in spades: backbone.  There will be times when the proper reading of the Constitution will diverge sharply from the conventional wisdom of D.C. elites, the legacy press and the legal intelligentsia.  Scalia never wilted in the face of intense criticism; indeed, he reveled in it, as it was a sign that he was properly discharging his constitutional duty.  I can't tell you whether Gorsuch possesses a Scalia-esque spine.  Time will tell.  If he does, he has a chance to be a great justice and fitting heir to the Scalia legacy.","status",NA,NA,181,20,12,13,0,0,0,3

The Drain the Swamp Act answers this call by instituting a permanent 5 year lobbying ban and broadening the scope of the federal definition of “lobbying” to include “consulting and advising.”    Although legal, the revolving door culture of Washington has led to a deluge of members of Congress and congressional staffers leaving government service for lucrative lobbying jobs on K Street.

Combined with term limits, which I have also introduced, these reforms will incentivize the rise of citizen-legislators who will focus on the national interest rather than on feathering their own nests.","link","http://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-ed-drain-the-swamp-by-desantis-20170207-story.html","orlandosentinel.com",210,24,45,18,0,0,0,3

It will provide the President with an opportunity to sketch out a policy vision and to seek congressional support for his initiatives.  I hope Trump addresses the following issues:  *Tax Reform.  The tax code is a disaster that creates unnecessary burdens on individuals in businesses, repels capital, and restrains economic growth.  Reforming the 80,000 page monstrosity is a prerequisite for sustained growth and job creation.  While there is a broad acknowledgement that the U.S.'s business tax rate is too high, which reduces America's competitiveness and makes it harder to attract capital and to keep jobs in the United States, there are provisions in the House's proposed tax overhaul, such as the creation of a border adjustment tax, that are highly controversial.  Trump should weigh in on this debate and articulate his goals for tax reform.  *ObamaCare repeal and health care reform.  The failures associated with ObamaCare have been well-documented: premiums and deductibles have gone through the roof, access to preferred doctors has diminished, co-ops have gone belly up, and insurers are fleeing the ObamaCare exchanges.  A recent Wall Street Journal poll found a mere 4% of Americans believe that ObamaCare should simply be allowed to continue on its current course.  Post-ObamaCare reforms need to focus on making health insurance more affordable, empowering individuals to choose their own plans free from government coercion, fostering price transparency regarding the cost of medical care, and reducing bureaucracy and red tape.  Trump supports repealing ObamaCare and replacing it with something ""terrific""; this will be a good time for him to sketch out his vision for patient-centered reform.  *Rebuilding our military.  Years of neglect have taken a significant toll on our military capability and readiness.  Meanwhile, the world keeps getting more dangerous: terrorism is a global phenomenon, rogue states like North Korea and Iran are busy developing and acquiring dangerous weapons, the Russian bear is on the march, and China is making a play to become the leading maritime power in the Pacific.  Adding ships to the fleet, expanding the Marine Corps and Army, and modernizing our equipment and weapons systems will make a big difference in meeting our national security challenges.  If done right, a successful rebuilding effort can help deter existing threats and prevent new threats from materializing.  Trump should make clear he is committed to restoring America's defenses.  *Reforming the VA.  The failures of the VA have been well-documented and are something that drew candidate Trump's wrath.  Simply continuing to expand bureaucracy and red tape within the VA will not meet the needs of our veterans.  Trump needs to make clear that he supports expanding choice for veterans caught in the morass of the VA bureaucracy and that he wants to act to address veteran suicides, including by supporting legislation such as my PAWS Act.  *Reducing the regulatory onslaught.  Most businesses see copious and monotonous regulations as representing a greater impediment to growth than even our tax code.  The House has acted to repeal a number of Obama-era regulations and has passed the REINS Act, which will provide a needed check on regulatory overreach.  Trump should highlight what he has already done to reduce regulations and ask Congress to do even more.  *Draining the swamp.  Imposing term limits on members of Congress and imposing a 5 year moratorium on lobbying by members of Congress, congressional staff, and executive branch officials would go a long way to reforming Washington.  Trump has called for these changes and I have drafted legislation for both issues.  Congress might not be receptive to these ideas but if Trump highlights them before the American people he will almost assuredly garner widespread public support.","status",NA,NA,49,18,6,1,0,0,0,1

The presidential waiver under the Jerusalem Embassy Act expires in a couple of months and I do not believe that President Trump will issue another waiver.  Therefore, just as Israelis are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jerusalem Day, the law will kick in and require that the American embassy be relocated to Jerusalem. Since both the National Security Subcommittee and the full committee have been active on embassy issues, it was important for me to visit the prospective sites for the new embassy and to review the logistics that such a relocation will entail.    I am thankful for members of the U.S. State Department for arranging a tour of the sites and for giving the staff and me a thorough briefing.

Crafted in secret and unveiled just a few weeks ago, the bill was rushed through two major House committees, without a single amendment, within days of its release.  It was rewritten as a “manager’s amendment” and released last Monday in advance of an artificial, self-created deadline of March 23 for passage of the bill.  Perhaps the bill was handled in this fashion because it had significant policy shortcomings. Rather than repeal ObamaCare, the AHCA retained the structure of ObamaCare and fused it with a handful of “replacement” items. The net result was a product that fell far short of the promises made to voters, was likely to cause health insurance premiums to sharply *increase* over the next several years, and discriminated against our veterans.  It is better to get it done right than get it done quickly.  Read more in this week's newsletter by clicking the link below.

The rule was promulgated last year but has not taken effect.  Curiously, it did not apply to companies such as Facebook and Google which make a fortune monetizing consumer preference data, thereby creating a double standard for broadband providers.  After President Trump signs it, the net effect on consumer data privacy will be: zero.      Prior to 2015, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulated data collection using an “opt-out” basis and instituted a flurry of enforcement actions to vindicate consumer privacy.  In 2015, the FCC preempted the FTC’s jurisdiction in so far as internet service providers were concerned.  The idea was to change the default to an “opt-in” rule which would make it more difficult for ISPs to compete with Google and Facebook.  This represents blatant favoritism and is not the way these issues should be handled; instead, rules should apply uniformly without benefit to politically-favored companies.  The best way to do this is to restore FTC jurisdiction over the issue of data privacy.","link","http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrydownes/2017/03/30/why-congresss-rejection-of-proposed-fcc-data-rules-will-not-affect-your-privacy-in-the-slightest/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=val&utm_term=ViEWS+Alerts&utm_content=congresssrejectionof","forbes.com",22,18,10,0,0,1,0,3

Had Scalise not been at practice, his security detail would not have been there and the death toll would have been significant.    I was at the practice and was playing third base, about 60 feet from the shooter’s perch, about 10 minutes before the first shots were fired.  Thankfully, my colleague Jeff Duncan and I decided to get on the road a few minutes early so we could beat traffic and get ready for our morning meetings.  When we first got in the car driven by Duncan’s staffer, a man approached us in the parking lot wanting to know whether the players on the field were Republicans or Democrats.  Jeff told him the players were Republicans, and the man proceeded to walk toward the field.  Though we didn’t know it at the time, the man was James Hodgkinson, the man who minutes later would attempt a mass murder.

The bill includes an amendment that I authored to hinder North Korea’s illicit nuclear program. The amendment calls for an assessment to determine which Chinese companies have ties to North Korea, particularly those contracting with the Department of Defense, and authorizes the Secretary of Defense to terminate or prohibit contracts based on that assessment.  As Kim Jong-un escalates his crazed campaign for a nuclear weapon, the United States needs to take action to stymie those efforts.

Had the President decided otherwise, a group of state Attorneys General were ready to bring a lawsuit that would have almost assuredly resulted in the program losing in court.  The American constitutional system of separated powers is designed to protect liberty.  When Congress rejects a particular measure, the President cannot simply legislate it on his own via an executive memo.  To pretend otherwise undermines the bedrock foundations of the constitutional order that the Founders deemed so vital.  President Trump has asked Congress to craft legislation to deal with this and related topics.  In doing so, it is important to put the interests of the American people front and center.  First, Congress should not increase incentives for illegal immigration, which a naked codification of Obama's executive action will do.  In addition, Congress should not expand chain migration, which could happen if an amnesty recipient can sponsor those who did knowingly violate our immigration laws.  To vindicate the interests of Americans, impediments to illegal immigration, from E-Verify to funding for a border wall, should be enacted.  Also, chain migration should be discarded in favor of admission criteria based on merit and skill.","status",NA,NA,396,218,110,49,3,4,3,68
