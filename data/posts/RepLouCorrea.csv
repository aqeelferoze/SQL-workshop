Yet, the presidency is about our nation and our constitution, and not about an individual. This inauguration is another event in a line of peaceful transitions of power that are the hallmark of our country.  I was elected to go to D.C. to work for my constituents, to help our middle class, to help all our working families, and to create good paying jobs. I came to DC to make sure that all Americans, including new Americans, have the opportunity to work hard and achieve the American Dream. I am here to work with all who will work with me, to work across the aisle, irrespective of party affiliation.       I'm going to D.C. to be at the table when decisions are made that affect my constituents.

Today, I voted ‘NO’ for the same reason. #California is already a donor state to the federal government. This tax bill only makes it worse.  Californians need tax reform. As the fifth largest economy in the world, Californians need federal tax policy that creates jobs, empowers our local businesses, helps California, and helps Main Street. Unfortunately, this bill doesn’t do that.  This bill forces #hardworking Californians to pay more to offset expensive tax cuts for America’s most well off. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Centers, 86 million households will see their taxes increase, with 83% of the tax cuts going to the top 1%.  As a Congressman, I need to support legislation that helps our neighbors, our working families, and our #smallbusinesses here in California.
