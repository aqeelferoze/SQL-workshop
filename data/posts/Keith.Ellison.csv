We hear it when American workers join together and fight for the right to collectively bargain. We hear it when thousands of people march for equality in our nation’s cities. Whether they are fast food workers, home health care workers, agricultural workers, we hear the call of Martin Luther King when people stand up to demand fair pay and a voice on the job.

The Voting Rights Act passed in 1965 outlawed discrimination in voting booths, but many are still denied the right to vote because of restrictive voting laws. It is with Dr. King’s voice that we continue to demand justice for Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner. It is with his voice that we declare Black lives matter.

We value the freedom to practice one’s religion without persecution, the freedom of self-determination, the freedom to build a good life for oneself and one’s family – these values are non-negotiable. But President Trump, and the Republicans who support him, are acting as if our shared beliefs, set forth in the Constitution, can be tossed aside.    “We are stronger when our decisions reflect our shared values of inclusion and equality. We are safer when we unite against actual threats. Demonizing people in search of a better life only increases ill-will towards us around the world. Forcing local jurisdictions by presidential mandate to assist with civil immigration enforcement will break faith with immigrant communities only to sow fear and mistrust. Militarizing the southern border and making immigration detention mandatory will only waste exorbitant amounts of taxpayer money and ensure vulnerable people continue to live in fear.   “Refugees, by definition, are those fleeing persecution – not persecutors themselves. Closing our borders to refugees fleeing devastation and war is morally indefensible. It’s cruel and it’s un-American.

President Trump’s Muslim ban will threaten the lives of thousands of refugees seeking asylum. It will make it harder to fight extremists in the Middle East who frame the conflict as a religious war between Christianity and Islam. It will undermine our international credibility and diplomatic strength. It will encourage resentment and fear between Americans of different faiths. And it will lead to more hate crimes and attacks on racial and religious minorities.   The order will also give preference to Christians fleeing Muslim-majority countries. These people are genuine refugees who deserve our compassion and support, but this preference is further proof that Donald Trump’s administration is actively trying to divide people.   We can resist this radical agenda. But we have to stand together. As progressives. As immigrants. As neighbors. As Americans.

Minnesotans care deeply about the Boundary Waters and have come together over the decades to ensure the protection of this treasured area. The new two-year study with its public comment period and its focus on science provides a crucial opportunity for my constituents and people from across America to discuss the best way to continue to protect the Boundary Waters for countless generations to come.     Mining jobs are an important part of our state’s economy. But we must ensure that these projects don’t pollute our soil and water, or disrupt the vulnerable ecosystems that are so critical to our environment. And we must consider that there are some places where it might be too dangerous to mine. The Boundary Waters attracts more than 250,000 visitors a year and supports an estimated 17,000 jobs in northern Minnesota – it too is an important part of our economy and our heritage. I hope the current President stands by President Obama’s decision to further study the impact of these projects in the Boundary Waters Watershed.","link","https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/obama-administration-takes-steps-protect-watershed-boundary-waters-canoe-area","doi.gov",1088,109,203,75,0,2,16,2

Low-income and working families are not guaranteed counsel in civil court, and legal representation in Tenant/Housing Court can mean the difference between keeping your house and being evicted. As America faces a shortage of affordable housing and rising rates of eviction in many cities, investing in affordable housing and common-sense solutions will prevent the trauma of homelessness and other socio-economic consequences of eviction and tenant-landlord conflicts. A recent study regarding New York City tenants facing eviction found that by providing legal representation to all low-income tenants, the city would save more than $300 million annually, as the effort would reduce the number of tenants and families seeking housing in shelters. New York City recently passed an initiative to ensure tenants with incomes under 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level would have a right to an attorney in Tenant Court. A similar proposal was also introduced in the Massachusetts State House.","link","http://ellison.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-ellison-introduces-equal-opportunity-for-residential-representation","ellison.house.gov",1236,139,87,106,4,0,1,0

Senate Republicans are so dedicated to those values that they have gone against more than 200 years of precedent and given a lifetime appointment to the nominee of a president under FBI investigation. There is a reason why Supreme Court nominees are required to meet a 60 vote threshold – to deny extremists like Neil Gorsuch a seat on the bench.

Everyday Americans will be forced to pick up this tab, and they’ll pay for it with their health, their security, and in some cases, with their lives.  “Calling this bill the “American Health Care Act” is a cruel irony – 24 million Americans will likely lose their coverage. Hundreds of millions of people who get their insurance through their employer could see their plans slashed. Seniors and people with pre-existing conditions will be priced out of their insurance plans. And as many as one million Minnesotans who have received affordable care through the expansion of Medicaid, essential health benefits, or the exchange will be worse off.   “This vote is a message to every American who has ever struggled to pay for healthcare. For once, Republicans are being candid.  “To the expecting mother whose insurance won’t pay for her maternity care and delivery because her state was granted a waiver on covering essential health benefits, Republicans say: perhaps you shouldn’t have gotten pregnant.  “To the parents in Minneapolis working multiple minimum wage jobs with no employer health benefits and relying on Medicaid to pay for their children’s checkups, Republicans say: you may have to choose between your children’s health and paying your rent.   “To the person born with a chronic illness, like my constituent Michael, born without eyes, who relies on Medicaid to help him live in his community, Republicans say: pull yourself up by your bootstraps.  “And to every single Minnesotan who has gotten insurance because of the Affordable Care Act, Republicans say: if you can’t afford to pay for health insurance yourself, you can’t afford to live a healthy life.   “In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote about ‘Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.’ There’s a reason life comes first. It’s hard to experience liberty or enjoy the pursuit of happiness if you aren’t healthy enough, or even alive, to do it.  “I’ve never thought healthcare should be a product to be bought and sold, taken for granted by some and out of reach for many, many others. Healthcare should be a right granted to every person.

This is a systemic problem which calls for a broad, comprehensive response. It’s particularly disturbing that video evidence is not available because the officers switched off their body cameras.   This tragedy, and others like it, will persist as long as our society resists holding our law enforcement accountable.  It’s going to take all of us, together, to see justice done and progress made.","status",NA,NA,1343,119,168,79,0,6,489,56

Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio was one of our country’s most notorious racists who racially profiled Latinos and tortured and humiliated inmates. He was lawfully convicted for refusing to comply with a court order to stop violating people’s constitutional rights.    Pardons are used when those convicted of crimes show a willingness to reform and become better citizens. Joe Arpaio has not done either. He has not apologized, shown remorse for his crimes or a willingness to repair the damage he’s done to his community.   Yet, Donald Trump believes that a man who used race as a way to abuse and oppress people is an ‘American patriot’.   This pardon comes just hours after it was reported that the Trump Administration may end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and signed a directive to ban transgender military recruits - all while a Category 4 Hurricane was making landfall in Texas and putting millions of lives at risk.   And let’s not forget, just two weeks ago, Trump said that some white supremacists and neo-Nazis were 'fine people'.   It's clear. President Trump is giving cover to white supremacy.","status",NA,NA,1925,243,349,10,12,8,244,651

Most were young immigrant women and girls.   This tragedy spurred New York into action with the most comprehensive investigation of factory conditions in the U.S. history. The International Ladies’ Garment Worker’s Union (ILGWU), comprised primarily of young Jewish and Italian immigrants, was at the forefront of the movement calling for safer workplace conditions, worker’s compensation, higher wages, and critical benefits.   Immigrant voices and actions have been critical to many of our hard-won fights for better working conditions.    Despite our progress, immigrant workers are still vulnerable in the workplace – particularly undocumented workers.  They often work in the most physically demanding jobs, face unsafe work conditions, and receive lower pay.    Thanks to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), nearly 800,000 undocumented youth were given temporary work permits and allowed to come out of the shadows. They were given the ability to speak up about injustices in the work place without fear of retaliation. And the results are stunning – 69% percent of Dreamers moved to a better paying job after receiving DACA, 65% purchased their first car, and 5% started their own business.  Over the next decade, Dreamers are expected to contribute over $460 billion to the economy.   Dreamers are our friends, neighbors, coworkers, and family members. The Trump administration is expected to abandon them in the next few days.    Labor Day is day to honor the workers of the Labor Movement who fought for a better future. We honor their memory by organizing and continuing to fight for the rights of all of America’s workers, documented and undocumented alike.    This Labor Day, I call on President Trump to stand with the labor movement, Dreamers, and all immigrants who have contributed to our society by protecting DACA and moving forward on comprehensive immigration reform that would provide a pathway to citizenship for so many of our neighbors, friends, and loved ones.   We all must stand together if we want to build an economy that works for everyone. Let’s take today to do right by all of America’s workers.  Happy Labor Day.","status",NA,NA,793,78,143,82,2,4,54,3

I will use every bit of my power as a member of Congress to help bring aid and relief to those affected by the latest in a string of unrelenting hurricanes, including the families of Minnesotans affected by the devastation.  But the conversation shouldn’t end there. Because for all of us, what’s happening in Puerto Rico should serve as a stirring reminder of the starkly different lives Americans lead if they’re among the privileged few, or the disenfranchised many. Even before Katrina erased black neighborhoods and Maria left an entire island without power, working people in these areas have been struggling harder than ever before to make ends meet. For working families who log overtime hours to pay rent, whether in Texas or Florida or Puerto Rico, there just isn’t an extra budget line to rebuild a destroyed home or business.  My vision is for a government that helps all families live fuller, more productive lives. That’s why I find it unconscionable that instead, President Trump and his allies in Congress keep trying to push them down, whether by trying to take away their health care or worsening the climate crisis that makes hurricanes like Maria more frequent and more intense.
