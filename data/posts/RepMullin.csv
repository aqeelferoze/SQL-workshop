The EPA’s RMP rule trades safety for paperwork and delivers far more burden than benefit for businesses that have to abide by it. It wraps our businesses up in more bureaucratic red tape and makes it more difficult for them to keep their doors open, risking not only safety but also valuable jobs. H.J.Res. 59 delivers much needed regulatory relief for our businesses.  A regulation that was intended to make our nation’s businesses safer will do just the opposite. The EPA overstepped OSHA with this rule and makes our operating facilities even less safe than they were before. Sensitive information will be more easily accessible, setting a precedent that even Department of Homeland Affairs (DHS) staff have expressed concerns over.  With that information in the wrong hands, our nation’s security will absolutely be compromised.","link","http://mullin.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=467","mullin.house.gov",26,14,1,1,0,0,0,0

President Obama issued a rule on his way out the door that mandated states had to use taxpayer dollars to fund health care clinics like Planned Parenthood. Today, we’re using the CRA to give states the flexibility to withhold taxpayer dollars from clinics like these. Overturning the rule doesn’t cut funding or access to coverage for women covered by Title X, but instead it redirects the funds to community health centers and hospitals that provide general health coverage.","link","https://policy.house.gov/legislative/bills/hj-res-43-providing-congressional-disapproval-under-chapter-8-title-5-united","policy.house.gov",134,45,17,12,1,1,0,6

Then, hearings and a markup are held on the legislation, before it’s passed out of committee and to the full House of Representatives. Once a bill goes to the House floor, it needs the support of 218 members of Congress in order to pass and be sent over to the Senate for consideration.    That’s why I’m pleased to have several bills that I’ve introduced and cosponsored passed on the House floor, including legislation to get veterans better benefits to access career tech schools (H.R. 3218), help find cures for pediatric cancers (H.R. 1231), and provide regulatory certainty to Oklahoma’s energy companies (H.R. 2883).
