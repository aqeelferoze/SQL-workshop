She knew him, his sense of humor, his timing, his love of our military first hand, up close and personal. Her Memorial Day post is so touching, I wanted to share with you.  Enjoy the read.  THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES AND THE SACRIFICE  It seems appropriate that Memorial Day would also be the birthday of Bob Hope, a man who gave so much of himself to our military that he was made an honorary veteran by an Act of Congress in 1997. After being presented with the honor by then President Bill Clinton, Bob said, “I’ve been given many awards in my lifetime, but to be numbered among the men and women I admire most is the greatest honor I have ever received.”  The troops meant a lot to Bob Hope. In 1941, after walking on stage at March Field, he knew he had found his audience. Bob Hope entertained 11 presidents in his life time, holds the record for the longest running consecutive contract with a television network (NBC), holds the record for having hosted the Oscars more than any other entertainer, but the military was the audience he held closest to his heart.  Thousands of letters received from GIs tell the story of his deep commitment to them, and his gratitude for their sacrifice. Countless mothers others wrote to thank him for personally calling to say that he had seen their son or daughter on the battlefield and that they sent their love. For some of these moms, it was the last message they received.  Bob Hope knew the importance of bringing laughter to these war-weary men and women, and he was determined to bring it to them. A letter from one soldier clearly shows his determination in that endeavor. The soldier wrote to thank Bob for what he had done for him and his company. He said they had walked to the staging area, but thousands of soldiers were already there and they couldn’t get close enough to see the show. So they started walking back to their camp. Bob heard about their plight and after the show he rounded up some of his troupe, piled them all into a jeep, and went out to find them along the road. Then, they parked and put on a private show just for them. That was Bob Hope.  Bob’s last military tour was in 1990. That's almost fifty years of dedicated service to our troops.  So on this Memorial Day, as we eat our barbecue and spend time with our families, let’s remember the men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. And let’s also say a prayer for those who continue to serve and protect our country. Bob Hope has passed on, but there is no doubt in my mind that if we were lucky enough to still have him here with us, that's exactly how he would be spending today.

His prediction came as the result of Richard Henry Lee's motion for independence being approved by the Congress on July 2, 1776. This motion officially separated the 13 colonies from Great Britain. On July 4th, 1776, Adams would join his colleagues in signing the Declaration of Independence – the document that articulated the reasons why the colonies separated from the British Empire. Even though he missed the mark by two days, Adams did outline how Americans would celebrate their Independence Day for years to come.

Despite what you may be hearing in the news, the House is still plugging away, working on the third step measures.   Today we take aim at one of the biggest health care cost drivers: medical liability reform.   On the floor today is the Protecting Access to Care Act, a bill designed to address frivolous and costly medical malpractice suits brought by out-of-control trial lawyers. By removing the endless litigation threats facing many doctors, they are better suited to practice medicine that is centered on the patient, not centered on protecting themselves against a lawsuit. The bill also codifies protections to ensure that patients still have access to justice and the ability to recover damages in the event of malpractice.    In addition to lowering health care costs for Americans, the CBO says other measures in the bill will save the taxpayer $50 billion over ten years. This bill is a good start towards attacking the true drivers of today’s steep health care costs. We have more work to do, and we are determined to get it done.","link","https://judiciary.house.gov/press-release/goodlatte-praises-house-judiciary-committee-approval-medical-lawsuit-reform-legislation/","judiciary.house.gov",186,117,28,13,4,0,2,32

Robust yet civil debate over policy disagreements have taken a back seat to thin-skin and knee-jerk reactions to hyper-partisan comments and, unfortunately, unfounded character attacks.   On the day Rep. Steve Scalise and others were shot, seemingly for nothing other than being Republican, not only were we reminded of the consequences of a collapse in civil discourse, but many, including me, renewed our commitment to unity and called for a return to the respectful and civil disagreements that have shaped debate and the political landscape since the birth of our great nation. Our nation and the cause of freedom have been well served by robust and spirited debate.  In this era of 24/7 worldwide news, the President of the United States represents each and every one of us on the world stage. Globally, the President is America, and in this day and age, actions are seen by more and more people and scrutinized more and more intensely around the world. We are right to expect a higher level of civility, graciousness, and diplomacy from our President. We expect the individual who holds the office and the title to rise above the hubris and noise of the day.  While the President is human, and fallible like the rest of us, this current trend needs to stop. This week’s tweets were a step way too far, regardless of what personal exchanges or insults had been hurled. From health care to immigration to trade to infrastructure to terrorism, there are far too many pressing issues facing this country for petty squabbles to be on the President’s radar. I respectfully request, Mr. President, that you turn your focus to the issues we are working on in Congress – the positive solutions we are trying to get to your desk to make America great again. You are delivering on your promises, as are we. Let’s talk more about those and less about one another. The American people would be grateful.  No matter who you are – President of the United States, a cable news anchor, plumber, lawyer, welder, doctor – bombast and ratings should not rank higher than our shared desire to live freely in this country alongside our fellow Americans. We are blessed to live in a country where we are free to express our opinions, no matter how inflammatory or hyperbolic. As a legislator, I work daily to protect those freedoms. But we ought also to remember that we are all a part of a greater humanity, and that civility in our interactions – both personal and digital – is not only proper, but fundamental to a respectful and prosperous society.","status",NA,NA,1351,1061,302,138,13,17,8,144

This event honors the Greatest Generation, allowing WWII Veterans to share their stories and experience with Tennesseans.  The captivating WWII battle reenactment greeted us with the sounds of automatic gunfire, tanks and artillery shells, and the shouting of leaders directing their soldiers into the fight. Veterans, volunteers, and citizens of Linden put on a beautiful demonstration of our nation's history. As the troops advanced toward the enemy (in this case actors), three beautifully-restored WWII aircraft made strafing runs on targets over downtown Linden with cool smoke trails billowing across a perfectly crisp blue September sky. The cry of “MEDIC!” rang through the streets as actors fell to imaginary bullets. Men, women and children alike were dressed to the nines in 40s regalia, which truly brought history to life. I asked my mother what made this generation different, to which she replied, ""We were all on the same team!""   I was honored to witness such a well-rehearsed event and look forward to attending again.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/marshablackburn/photos/a.318529878395.150142.6470828395/10155664321118396/?type=3",NA,247,30,51,36,0,6,1,1
