Today I wear red in solidarity with A Day Without A Woman, in recognition of the enormous value that women add to our economy and our society. Yet women receive lower wages, experience greater inequities, discrimination, and job insecurity. I believe in the human rights of women and we must join together to be bold for change at this time when we need it most.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepAlLawsonJr/photos/a.1717714348559329.1073741829.1712959155701515/1745267409137356/?type=3",NA,28,8,9,2,0,0,0,0

This abomination of a health care disaster will raise health care premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for hard-working Americans while at the very same time, giving $600 billion in tax breaks to big corporations.   Some estimated 24 million Americans could lose their health care coverage under this new bill, while those with pre-existing conditions will be at the mercy of their state leadership, which could opt out of guaranteeing them access to affordable health care. Trumpcare will allow insurance companies to charge people 50 and over five times more than they charge other people and it weakens the life of the Medicare trust fund.  None of us can choose when and where we will need emergency care, or when we might join the millions of Americans who already have pre-existing conditions. No one should live in fear of not being able to seek medical care because it might lead to higher premiums they cannot afford.   We need to make it easier to access and afford health care in our country, and Republicans have not put us on the path to do that. Rather they have taken us back in time and created more obstacles for those who need it most to get the health care they need.","status",NA,NA,34,19,13,2,0,0,9,12

It is a short-sighted plan that seeks to give tax breaks to the wealthiest while taking away lifelines for those who need it most.  In my district, one in every four Floridians has been on food stamps at some point over the last 12 months. That is twice the national average. It is unconscionable for the President to propose cutting nutrition benefits at any level, because any reduction would mean less for those in North Florida who need it most. Every day, children who qualify for free breakfast and lunch attend school and are fed the only meals they will receive that day because their parents can‚Äôt afford to feed them. We put hard-working Floridians in the no-win position of having to choose between paying their light bill or affording healthy food. This is unacceptable.  This budget calls for slashing $800 billion from Medicaid over the next decade, another $192 billion from nutritional assistance, and $72 billion from disability benefits. It calls for eliminating loan programs that subsidize college education for the poor and for those who take jobs in the government or nonprofit organizations. At a time when we need to be working to make college more affordable and accessible in order to prepare the next generations for tomorrow‚Äôs jobs, this is counterproductive to the President‚Äôs own stated goals.  This budget continues corporate welfare for Wall Street and major corporations, while forcing those who can afford it the least to sacrifice the most. I believe that our national budget is a reflection of our values as a society and this does not align with the values of Florida‚Äôs fifth Congressional district, and therefore I intend to strongly oppose it. I will continue to stand firmly for all Americans who need a helping hand in order to find jobs, support their families, contribute to growing our economy and to what makes America a great place to call home.","status",NA,NA,48,28,9,3,0,0,0,10
