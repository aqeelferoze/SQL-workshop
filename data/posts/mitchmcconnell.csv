I commend the President and his national security team for a thoughtful review of our engagement in the region.   ‚ÄúThat is the mission of our forces, ensuring that Afghanistan does not again become a safe haven for terrorist groups planning to execute attacks against the United States. Because of that purpose, we cannot assign an arbitrary deadline on withdrawal, especially against resilient enemies like al Qaeda and the Taliban. ISIL, al Qaeda, and its affiliates in Yemen, Syria and elsewhere, remain intent on attacking Americans.  Our forces, commanded in the region by General John Nicholson,  are engaged in two critical tasks: finding, fixing and finishing terrorists; and training and assisting Afghan security forces.  Our forces pursue these objectives in partnership with our North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies who rushed to our side after September 11th, and with our Afghan partners.  It is imperative that Gen. Nicholson receive sufficient force levels to accomplish these tasks.    ‚ÄúJust as the United States maintained forward deployed forces in Japan and Germany after the Second World War and in South Korea after the armistice, a residual presence in Afghanistan and in Iraq, preserves the gains we have made in the respective conflicts in those countries--and America pursues our interests by supporting host nation forces.  Despite all of our efforts, and the unmistakable sacrifice and valor of our forces, we remain threatened by terrorists, as last week‚Äôs attacks in Spain reminded us all.  Maintaining forces in Iraq and Afghanistan protects America's national security interests. Our overseas presence should not be guided by arbitrary withdrawal deadlines. The Taliban will never agree to a political settlement in Afghanistan if a date for our drawdown has been handed to them.   ‚ÄúOur all-volunteer force--and their families--have sacrificed so much over the last 16 years. Asking them to do more should never be something that our Commander-in-Chief or Congress does unless our national security interests are threatened and unless we are prepared to provide them with the authorities and forces needed to accomplish their mission. The Trump administration, and this Congress, should be equal to that responsibility.‚Äù","status",NA,NA,385,341,34,31,12,5,5,79

Without it, Democrats will continue to play partisan politics and obstruct our efforts to get our economy flourishing and growing at its full potential.   After a decade of lost economic opportunity, hardworking American families know the status quo is unacceptable.

Just last week, the 101st Airborne Combat Aviation Brigade deployed from Fort Campbell in my home state to help support relief efforts in Puerto Rico.  The #Kentucky Board of Emergency Medical Services selected eight fire departments from around my state to send to Florida to assist local operations after #HurricaneIrma. Working 12-hour shifts, these firefighters responded to 9-1-1 calls in Tampa as residents begin to move back into their homes.  Throughout my state, churches and non-profits sent volunteers to help however they could. One religious organization arranged more than 200 volunteers to help flood victims in Texas and Florida. In all, they served over 78,000 meals, helped with laundry, and distributed many bottles of water.  The Kentucky Humane Society stepped in to care for pets that were affected, and chapters of the American Red Cross from across the Commonwealth have mobilized to help where needed. The Kentucky Association of Electric Cooperatives sent dozens of linemen to Georgia to help restore power after Hurricane Irma. The joint effort from 17 of our state‚Äôs electric cooperatives represents one of the largest mutual deployments in Kentucky history.   These Kentuckians ‚Äì along with so many more ‚Äì have generously given their time and labor to help their fellow Americans during this time of suffering. And they aren‚Äôt alone. Compassionate men and women from around the country have joined the cause to help ease the pain of the victims.","video","https://www.facebook.com/mitchmcconnell/videos/1543296482375704/",NA,66,105,8,7,11,1,1,5

The Obama Administration‚Äôs determination to draw down America‚Äôs conventional military presence from across the globe, avoid conflict with competitor nation states even when those same countries threatened our national security interests, and its drive to negotiate an agreement with Iran that left a state sponsor of terror with an internationally recognized nuclear enrichment program was simply inadequate.   The president‚Äôs decision not to certify that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is ‚Äòin the vital national security interests of the United States‚Äô now provides the opportunity for Congress to strengthen the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act and create a standard for certification that is consistent with our interests. And it makes clear to our allies that more work must be done to contain Iran‚Äôs malign behavior. I am committed to working with the Trump Administration to constrain Iran‚Äôs support for terrorism and proxy militias, impede the threat of ballistic missiles and deny Iran the path to a nuclear weapon. Strengthening the criteria attached to a presidential certification is solely within the powers of the American government and based on making the verification of the JCPOA more in keeping with our national interests.        An element of this new approach to Iran is to recognize that our strategy must be based on the national security interests of the United States, such as preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, countering terrorism and preserving our security and that of our allies.  This overall approach to staunch Iranian aggression cannot be held hostage to the JCPOA. For too long the Obama Administration ignored Iranian harassment of U.S. naval ships in the Persian Gulf, efforts of Shia militias to create a land bridge through Iraq and Syria to Hezbollah and the arming of the Houthis in Yemen.  The Trump Administration now has the opportunity to work with the Congress and our allies to respond appropriately to these actions. http://bit.ly/2ym05Xw","status",NA,NA,145,413,15,17,15,2,3,137

This additional tool can help give medical professionals the ability to make better-informed treatment decisions.  Last year, I shepherded the ‚Äú21st Century Cures Act‚Äù into enactment with strong bipartisan support. This law authorized $1 billion in federal assistance to states to boost their efforts to address opioid abuse and addiction. These resources promote innovative thinking by states to build upon the work they‚Äôve been doing.  I was also proud to prioritize the consideration of another bipartisan measure to combat the #opioidcrisis, the ‚ÄúComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act‚Äù #CARA. This critical law is expanding prevention, treatment, recovery, and law enforcement efforts to address the epidemic in communities across the nation.
