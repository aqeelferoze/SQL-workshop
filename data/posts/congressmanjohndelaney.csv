In 1834, Blair received his first patent for a corn planter, a wheel-driven device that allowed farmers to plant more corn using less labor in a shorter period of time. (see image below) The planter looked much like a wheelbarrow, with a compartment included to hold seeds and rakes which dragged behind to cover the soil. Newspaper accounts at the time claimed that the device would combine the labor of eight people into one device. Two years later, Blair received his second patent, this time for a cotton planter.

At the age of 19, Pennington escaped, eventually landing in Pennsylvania and then later moving to New York. As a young man he made his way to New York, where he worked diligently to receive an education, paying for tutors out of his earnings. Pennington began attending classes at Yale Divinity School in the 1830s, becoming the first black student to study at Yale, although he was not allowed to speak in class or borrow books from the library. Pennington later became a prominent minister, public speaker and abolitionist, speaking across the United States and United Kingdom. In 1841, he wrote one of the first histories of African-Americans and published a memoir, The Fugitive Blacksmith. Pennington wrote about the difficult life endured by slaves and disputed pro-slavery rhetoric. Pennington’s story was popular and went through three editions in two years. In the late 1840s he became deeply involved in the anti-slavery movement and was a delegate to the 1843 Anti-Slavery Convention in London. During the Civil War, Pennington helped recruit black troops to serve in the Union Army.

Today's entry is Frederick Douglass, who has made his way into the news recently. Douglass was born a slave in 1818 in Talbot County. Douglass learned to read and write at a young age, teaching other slaves to do the same. Douglass often said, “Knowledge is the pathway from slavery to freedom.” Douglass met Anne Murray, a free woman, in 1837. She motivated him to escape slavery in 1838, eventually taking a train north to freedom. After gaining his freedom, Douglass began to read The Liberator, a weekly journal written by William Lloyd Garrison. The Liberator inspired Douglass to get more involved in the abolitionist movement. He gave impassioned speeches across the country, detailing his life story and rousing many Americans to take action. In 1845, Douglass published one of his most widely read and influential works, “Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave.” His autobiography immediately became a bestseller, capturing the brutality of slavery in America. Douglass began publishing his first abolitionist newspaper, The North Star, with the motto “Right is of no Sex – Truth is of no Color – God is the Father of us all, and we are all brethren.” Douglass not only fought for emancipation, but for women’s suffrage. He attended the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, where he was a major influence passing a resolution asking for women’s suffrage. Douglass continued to fight for civil rights and suffrage throughout the Civil War and Reconstruction periods. By the time of his death in 1895, Douglass was known around the world as a champion for justice, freedom, and equality.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmanjohndelaney/photos/a.325893790852374.72988.324527257655694/1129649997143412/?type=3",NA,48,3,12,6,0,1,0,0

Born into slavery, as an adult Josiah worked in the fields for a man named Isaac Riley, on his farm in Montgomery County in what is now in North Bethesda.  He quickly gained the favor of Riley and became the supervisor of his master’s farm.  After saving up $350, Josiah Henson attempted to buy his freedom from Riley with a promise of an extra $100.  Riley added an extra zero to the paper, changing the fee to $1000 and cheated Josiah out of his freedom and money. Josiah then escaped with his family to Canada, where he founded a settlement for escaped slaves. The Dawn settlement grew to 500 people at its peak, and they exported black walnut lumber to the United States and Britain. Henson's autobiography, The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, as Narrated by Himself is believed to have inspired the title character of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. Henson was the first black man to be featured on a Canadian stamp.

First, the fiduciary rule does not limit choices, it only requires advisors to be held to a standard of doing what is best for the client. Second, does he really think the private sector can't innovate and offer middle class investors and retirees a range of choices while also being held to the standard where they have to put their clients’ interests first? Third, his whole premise is that creating retirement wealth comes from choices is flawed. What creates retirement wealth is being invested in sound investments, prudent diversification, low fees, and getting advice that is not conflicted. Just ask Warren Buffet who always tells investors to simply invest in low fee index funds, but maybe Mr. Cohen knows better.

Today’s profile is explorer Matthew Henson, who made history planting the American flag at the North Pole in 1909. Henson’s journey began in Maryland in 1866, when he was born in Charles County. Both of Henson’s parents died by the time he was nine and by age 12, Henson was working in Baltimore. In 1887, he met the explorer Robert Peary and joined Peary’s crew on his 1890 expedition to Greenland. For the next twenty years, Henson spent much of his time in the Arctic, developing his skills driving sleds and learning the Inuit language. In 1906, Peary’s expedition reached the furthest point north of any expedition to date. Three years later, in 1909, Henson was part of a six-man expedition to the North Pole, the only American to join Peary on the trip. Traveling ahead of Peary on April 6 1909, Henson approached the Pole. After walking back to join Peary, Henson told him, “I think I'm the first man to sit on top of the world.” Henson is credited as Co-Discoverer of the North Pole. In 1912, Henson published his memoirs. Henson was admitted to the prestigious Explorers Club in New York and honored by Presidents Truman and Eisenhower before he died in 1955. Henson’s tomb reads, “The lure of the Arctic is tugging at my heart. To me the trail is calling. The old trail. The trail that is always new.” The Matthew Henson Trail and Matthew Henson State Park in Montgomery County are named for him.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmanjohndelaney/photos/a.325893790852374.72988.324527257655694/1132704910171254/?type=3",NA,36,2,16,0,0,5,0,0

Banneker was largely self-educated in astronomy and in mathematics. He became an active writer of almanacs and was appointed by President George Washington to the District of Columbia Commission. His early accomplishments included constructing a wooden clock and accurately forecasting eclipses. Banneker's talents eventually came to the attention of the Ellicott brothers, industrialists in the Baltimore area. In 1791, Banneker teamed up with Major Andrew Ellicott, an American surveyor, to map the new national capital. During Thomas Jefferson's tenure as Secretary of State, Banneker wrote Jefferson and attacked his position on slavery and urged him to recognize that “one Universal Father…afforded us all the same sensations and endowed us all with the same faculties.” Banneker's outspokenness with regard to the issue of slavery earned him the widespread support of the abolitionist societies in Maryland and Pennsylvania, both of which helped him publish his almanac.

Johnson was born a slave around 1763. George Johnson purchased Joshua and acknowledged Joshua as his son when Joshua was 19. Joshua received his freedom in 1782 and devoted his life to painting. There are no records of Johnson receiving educational or creative training. We do know that as of 1796, he advertised himself as a portrait painter and a limner, a painter of ornamental decoration. Johnson painted many elite Baltimoreans, such as judicial officers, captains, and wealthy plantation owners. Noticeably, Johnson sometimes painted multi-figure family group portraits, a very rare practice during this period in American history. Financially successful as an artist, records indicate that Johnson was a property owner in Montgomery, Frederick and Anne Arundel County later in live. Johnson would have been able to make extra money painting chairs.  Johnson died around 1824, leaving his mark on America as one of the original prominent self-taught artists.

She was exposed to literature and prose throughout her schooling at the Academy for Negro Youth, inspiring her to write poetry from a young age. Harper’s poetry career formally began in 1845 with the release of her first collection, Forest Leaves. After teaching at Union Seminary, a school that was ran by abolitionist John Brown, Harper focused her writing talents towards the abolitionist movement.  In addition to joining the anti-slavery lecture circuit, Harper wrote renowned pieces including “Bury Me in a Free Land” and “Sketches of Southern Life.” These poems brought to life the themes and stories of the abolitionist movement.  “Bury Me in a Free Land” begins, “Make me a grave where’er you will,/ In a lowly plain, or a lofty hill;/ Make it among earth’s humblest graves,/ But not in a land where men are slaves.” Harper further made history as the first African-American woman to publish a short story. Along with Harriet Tubman, Ida B. Wells and other female abolitionists, Harper helped found a national association for African-American women. Harper passed away in 1911.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmanjohndelaney/photos/a.325893790852374.72988.324527257655694/1136221066486305/?type=3",NA,46,1,10,4,0,0,0,0

She was particularly inspired by the care she received at Johns Hopkins Hospital’s pediatric center and her work as a nursing aide at Sinai Hospital. She graduated with honors from Dunbar High School, one of only two East Baltimore high schools accepting African-American students at the time. Though she was an entirely qualified candidate, the school denied her admission. With the help of NAACP leaders Charles Hamilton Houston, Donald Gains Murray, and Thurgood Marshall, she successfully sued for her right to attend the school. McCready’s persistence to get the best education possible desegregated University of Maryland’s Nursing School, and paved the way for other departments at the university to follow suit. Her case, was decided on April 14th, 1950. McCready dedicated her life to nursing, working at the Druid Health Center, Cornell Medical Center, and Harlem Hospital.

In 1889, Wilson enlisted in the 9th Calvary, popularly known as the Buffalo Soldiers. When Wilson’s unit was surrounded by hostile forces in 1890, scouts refused to risk their lives to send a message for assistance. However, Wilson volunteered to break out of the blockade to deliver a message for help, helping to turn the tide of battle. In 1891, Wilson was awarded the Medal of Honor, for “qualities of the most conspicuous bravery and gallantry.”  In 1898, Wilson returned to Hagerstown and began his civilian life. In Hagerstown, Wilson worked as a carpenter and upholsterer. In 1988, a traffic triangle was named for him and a marker placed there. In 1997, the Veterans Administration placed a military marker at his grave. A feature on Wilson from WHAG TV is linked below.","link","http://www.your4state.com/news/news/corporal-william-o-wilson-hagerstowns-own-buffalo-solider-and-medal-of-honor-recipient/382171979","your4state.com",40,2,14,2,0,0,0,0

Born into slavery in Dorchester County in 1822, Tubman was a pivotal figure in the Underground Railroad. As a child Tubman was beaten, suffering from severe head injuries that would lead to seizures and headaches throughout her life. In 1850, concerned about her family, Tubman escaped slavery and moved to Philadelphia.  By 1851 she was working to help others gain their freedom. Over the course of a decade she made repeated trips into slave-holding areas, leading over 60 out of slavery. Tubman developed keen skills in subterfuge, covert travel and disguise to escape capture. One of her last trips was to retrieve her parents, who had become free but were still under threat of arrest for aiding others. According to Tubman, throughout her many years on the railroad, she never lost a “passenger.” Tubman was a strong supporter of the Union during the Civil War and helped lead an armed assault and the rescue of hundreds of slaves in South Carolina. In later years, Tubman became an advocate for women’s suffrage. To mark the centennial of Tubman’s death in 2013, President Obama signed into law the creation of the Harriet Tubman Monument in Cambridge, Maryland.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmanjohndelaney/photos/a.325893790852374.72988.324527257655694/1140076032767475/?type=3",NA,92,5,28,16,0,0,0,0

He inherited the Afro-American from his father in 1922, serving as the paper’s publisher and chief editor for 49 years. Under his guidance, the Afro-American increased its distribution substantially, producing a national edition and local editions in Philadelphia, Newark, Richmond and more. The Afro-American also covered African American soldiers fighting in WWII by reporting from the battleground and played a key role in amplifying the Civil Rights movement. Carl Murphy further served as Chairman of the Legal Defense Committee of the NAACP, working towards desegregating schools, from the University of Maryland’s David Murray case in 1935 to Brown v Board of Education in 1954. John Murphy once said, ""I measure a newspaper not in building, equipment and employees. Those are the trimmings. A newspaper succeeds because its management believes in itself, in God and in the present generation.” Owing to John and Carly Murphy’s management, the Afro-American runs today in Baltimore, Washington and Prince George’s County.","status",NA,NA,33,1,6,1,0,0,0,0

Mitchell Jr., civil rights leader. Mitchell was born on March 8, 1911 in Baltimore. As a young man Mitchell started his career writing for the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper, where he covered the infamous Scottsboro case and the lynching of Matthew Williams. These events led him to pursue racial justice. In 1947 he began working for the NAACP and would eventually become one of their leading representatives in Washington.  Mitchell was instrumental in building support for landmark civil rights legislation such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and the Fair Housing Act. Mitchell was so effective that he was nicknamed the “101st Senator.” After the assassination of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968, Mitchell was one of the African-American leaders who met with President Johnson. On June 9, 1980 President Carter awarded Mitchell the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States, for his distinguished service to the country and the advancement of equal rights. Later in life he wrote a weekly column for the Baltimore Sun. The Mitchell Building at the University of Maryland is named for him. His brother Parren was the first African-American elected to Congress from Maryland.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmanjohndelaney/photos/a.325893790852374.72988.324527257655694/1148263731948705/?type=3",NA,20,1,5,0,0,0,0,0

Born a slave in Maryland in 1818, Garnet eventually gained his freedom and became a Presbyterian minister in New York. In the decades before the Civil War, Garnet became a leading abolitionist, traveling as far as Scotland to speak out against slavery. Garnet became a member of the American Anti-Slavery Society and helped recruit African-Americans to join the Union Army when the Civil War broke out. For his efforts, Garnet was attacked by a mob in 1863, but eluded their capture. In 1865, President Lincoln invited Garnet to speak in the House chamber in the U.S. Capitol to commemorate the passage of the 13th Amendment, which ended slavery. In his historic remarks, Garnet challenged Congress to “Emancipate, Enfranchise, and to Educate.” Years later, Garnet was appointed U.S. Minister to Liberia, where he died in 1881.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmanjohndelaney/photos/a.325893790852374.72988.324527257655694/1149495241825554/?type=3",NA,29,0,6,0,0,0,0,0

A community leader, Wheaton was instrumental in establishing a local high school for African-American children in the area. Wheaton Park in Hagerstown, which was opened in 1935, is named for him.

Lewis (1942-1993) the first African-American to create a billion dollar company. Lewis was born in Baltimore and raised in a middle-class neighborhood. After attending Virginia State College on a football scholarship, he graduated in 1965 with a degree in economics and went on to attend Harvard Law School. After fifteen years as a corporate lawyer, Lewis purchased the McCall Pattern Company, reconstructed its business model and led the company to its most profitable year ever. In 1987, Lewis bought Beatrice International Foods, renamed it TLC Beatrice International and, with peak sales of $2.2 billion, transformed it into the largest African-American owned and managed business in the United States. Lewis was also known for his work as a philanthropist. His first major grant was a $1 million dollar donation to Howard University. In 1992, he contributed $3 million to Harvard Law School, the largest ever donation in the school’s history. In response, Harvard created the first major facility on their campus named in honor of an African-American, the Reginald F. Lewis International Law Center. Among a variety of programs, the grant supports education programs for minority students. During his life, Lewis supported new efforts to celebrate African-American culture. His foundation was instrumental in the creation of the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture in Baltimore.","status",NA,NA,48,2,8,1,0,1,0,0

America needs a FBI that can operate efficiently and effectively and it is in the national interest that the FBI has a new consolidated headquarters. Yes, this is terrible news for Maryland and the region, but the American people should know how illogical and self-defeating this is. National security, law enforcement and crime prevention are core functions of government and this move makes no sense in that context. The problems at the Hoover Building are well-documented and they are hindering the Bureau’s ability to function. This decision means that significant time and money at the federal, state and local level will have been wasted, this is another example of the Trump Administration hypocritically taking very fiscally-irresponsible actions while spouting rhetoric about belt-tightening.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmanjohndelaney/photos/a.325893790852374.72988.324527257655694/1276785772429833/?type=3",NA,150,79,40,0,1,8,18,58

President Trump has repeatedly shown that he lacks a moral compass and subjecting individuals who were brought here as children to the immediate threat of deportation is inhumane. I find the rhetoric from the Administration that this isn’t a massive deportation threat to be laughably hollow; President Trump has made it very clear he thinks little of immigrants and is focused on enacting an economically illiterate and immoral crusade against them. Anti-immigrant policies have been one of the few areas of consistent behavior in his chaotic presidency. Congress should call Trump’s bluff and quickly pass the bipartisan DREAM Act. Republicans control both chambers of Congress and now it is time for GOP leaders to put country first and actually move forward on protecting a policy they say they support.","link","https://delaney.house.gov/news/press-releases/delaney-statement-on-the-trump-administration-ending-daca","delaney.house.gov",330,125,50,9,4,3,40,36

Look at where the vast majority of venture capital investment is going right now: Northern California, New York and Massachusetts, three high-tax areas.

I also continued to convey my support for investor protections like the Fiduciary Rule, which is designed to ensure that middle class families get retirement advice that is in their best interest.","video","https://www.facebook.com/congressmanjohndelaney/videos/1358318670943209/",NA,93,15,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Like pulling out of the Paris Agreement, this is a massive mistake that really hurts the country. In addition to undermining our environment, this is going to hurt our public health, hurt our ability to create new jobs in the industries of the future and hurt our economic leadership in alternative energy. Like so much of what the Trump Administration is doing, this is handing our global competitors a golden opportunity.   Instead of working in a bipartisan manner to combat climate change, the Trump Administration is doing everything they can to leave us with a dirtier and more impoverished future. It is incumbent upon members to work together on this issue. I’m proud to author carbon tax legislation that uses market forces to reduce carbon emissions and provides impacted coal industry workers with substantial benefits.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/epas-pruitt-signs-proposed-rule-to-unravel-clean-power-plan/2017/10/10/96c83d2c-add2-11e7-a908-a3470754bbb9_story.html?utm_term=.50db7721c171","washingtonpost.com",50,28,22,1,3,4,8,39

It’s clear now that those days are long gone. By increasing our deficit, this legislation is going to make it much more difficult to invest in infrastructure, education and science and research – and that’s going to hurt our ability to thrive in the future that’s coming. This bill will also put increased pressure on important programs that help the most vulnerable in our society. I am deeply concerned that this bill will cement-in the stark inequality that has accelerated in recent decades.  This is a huge missed opportunity, because we really do need to do actual tax reform in a way that helps working people and helps our businesses compete. A bill that would have included infrastructure, tax breaks for the middle class and a lower corporate rate, would have passed with substantial bipartisan support, instead we have this bill that delivers 83% of its benefits to the top 1% according to the Tax Policy Center. This bill is being sold as a jobs bill, when the private sector is already saying they won’t use these cuts to hire people – it’s a classic bait and switch.","link","https://delaney.house.gov/news/press-releases/delaney-votes-against-gop-tax-bill-0","delaney.house.gov",165,68,27,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
