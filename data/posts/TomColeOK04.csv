Free speech and the right to demonstrate are fundamental American liberties. But racism, neo-Nazism and support for the Ku Klux Klan are never acceptable. In this case, these sentiments led directly to violence, which took the life of an innocent young woman and was indirectly responsible for the deaths of two law enforcement officials, as well as injuries to dozens of innocent people. Such events are never acceptable and ought to be condemned unequivocally by every American.   In the days and weeks ahead, it is my hope that we can reflect and come together as a people, and continue to work to resolve the differences that may divide us. In the interim, we should all mourn for those we have lost, pray for those that are injured and refrain from words or actions that make this difficult situation even more divisive and painful.","status",NA,NA,286,116,34,19,2,1,12,5
