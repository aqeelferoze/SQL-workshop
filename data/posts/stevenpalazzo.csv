The bill would limit members of Congress to twelve years of service, six terms in the House or two terms in the Senate.    I personally believe our nation would be much better off if there were no career politicians. That is why I have introduced a term limits bill for the last three Congresses that forces politicians to go back home and live under the same laws they created, knowing they will likely do less damage to our country and work more to improve the lives of hardworking Americans.","status",NA,NA,123,23,19,6,0,0,0,0

While surveying the damage at William Carey I ran into the three young men in the picture below. They are international students and as they were sharing their story with me I was truly touched by what I heard.   They were driving on campus when the tornado hit throwing all 3 of them and their vehicle about 100ft.  After they got out of the car they noticed an American Flag on the ground and hung it up on that guard shack. When I asked why they did that they said, if it was their national flag from their country, they hope someone would do the same.  The respect and kindness they displayed with that small act makes me both proud and hopeful. That kind of goodwill among neighbors  is going to be the key to rebuilding and renewing our communities.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/stevenpalazzo/photos/a.201462329881747.54456.186908658003781/1484812091546758/?type=3",NA,146,10,28,28,0,0,0,0

While speaking to these members, I mentioned that General Mattis is a leader who understands that our national debt is the number one threat to America right now. President Trump has asked for increased defense spending, which will reset and preserve the force, as well as ensure our readiness in the face of any potential conflict.   An important part of keeping a ready force is taking care of those who serve, paying them the benefits they HAVE EARNED, and making sure they have a smooth transition back to civilian life.   I'm working with Congressman Tim Walz on introducing legislation that will ensure that many of our National Guardsmen are not excluded from the benefits they've earned.

Fisheries data is not being adequately managed on a federal level. This year’s announcement of the three day snapper season was resounding proof of that. Our fishermen have suffered unfairly from an excessively shrinking snapper season for the past decade, and these bills will provide our states with the power they need to manage their own fisheries.   Throughout this year, my gulf coast colleagues and I have been successful in working with the new leadership within the Department of Commerce, and finally making strides to provide relief for our recreational fishermen at home. Yesterday’s passage of this legislation in committee is another giant step towards finding a long-term solution to this extremely important issue to the Mississippi Gulf Coast.","status",NA,NA,75,34,5,3,0,0,0,4
