Choice was scheduled to end on August 7, but President Trump signed The Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act on Wednesday extending the program until early 2018. Veterans will no longer be responsible for paying the private provider. The new law makes the Veterans Administration the primary payer. The Act also makes record-sharing between the VA and outside doctors easier. The Veterans Choice program has already expanded access to care for veterans. Now, the extension gives Congress time to work on more ways to allow veterans to get the help they need outside of the VA system.

We should all be concerned with current efforts to dismantle the work of Republicans and Democrats over the last 47 years—work that has resulted in cleaner air and water and made the Earth safer for all living beings. This week I cosponsored a resolution to recognize Earth Day and encourage environmental education and activism.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmansablan/photos/a.253162547663.175360.153423912663/10155325169417664/?type=3",NA,10,1,2,0,0,0,0,0

And after a long wait for the SNAP-like pilot program to be implemented in the Northern Marianas, FNS advised me this week that my work to include language in the FARMM bill providing a pilot program with over $30 million, in addition to the annual $12 million block grant funds, is finally expected to begin either June or July, 2017. FNS reported that they are now just about done putting final touches to the program.  I thank Governor Torres, Mr. Robert Hunter, Mr. Walter Macaranas, Region IX FNS Administrator Mr. Jesus Mendoza and his team, Mr. Scott Carter, Director of FNS headquarters' congressional affairs for their leadership, and to our many dedicated NAP staff for their long and hard work developing the program so it is ready to implement.  I also give special mention to my former congressional office colleague Mr. Ed H. Manglona for months of hard work working with me to get our legislation to pass Congress and signed into law.  I am saddened that our former governor, the late Eloy S. Inos, who was a strong supporter of this program from the start, is not with us to witness the start of the program.  We need this program to begin in earnest because we need to gather data that we can use to justify extending this Pilot Program in the FARMM bill reauthorization legislation that is expected to be considered in the Agriculture Committee sometime later this year or early next year.  And I need to find funds for FNS and NAP to implement the EBT cards in the Northern Marianas.  Most importantly, we need this improved program so that families, including some 6,000 children, who are eligible for food assistance could see some increase to their benefits while also safeguarding against program fraud. Changing the program's eligibility guidelines will also allow those individuals who work full time and receive assistance, to probably not lose eligibility even if their earnings increases with the minimum wage increases scheduled for September of 2017 and 2018.   These individuals could continue to work full-time while also remaining eligible to receive help feeding their families.","video","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpML8tAWUTs",NA,780,59,93,27,1,19,0,0

A rock solid education puts our children on a path to success, and our schoolteachers play a critical role in helping our children learn and grow.  Which is why education remains my top priority in Congress.  And my ranking member position in a House Education and the Workforce Subcommittee gives me a seat at the table, and a top seat on the dais to question and seek solutions on important issues facing our public and private schools.  I visited several schools this month again and I met with students, teachers, school administrators and PSS Commissioner of Education Deleon Guerrero and some of her leadership team.  During this National Teacher Appreciation Week, I am writing to express how truly inspired I am by the teachers of the Northern Marianas and their dedication to our students.  The change of leadership in the new Federal government administration makes the road ahead challenging, especially since the new administration has approved laws which provide less transparency in teacher preparation programs, ensure less diversity in our teaching workforce, and weaken oversight from the Department of Education to ensure a quality education for every student.   As your Delegate and as a ranking member of a subcommittee of the House Education and the Workforce Committee I will continue to fight so all of our children have access to a quality education.  And that begins by standing with the teachers who are committed to excellence for our students.   I hope that you will join me in supporting our teachers and all our schools during this National Teacher Appreciation Week.  Let a teacher know that you appreciate what they do to help mold our future through the education and training of our children – their students.  A huge thank you goes out to all teachers for their dedication in shaping our Commonwealth's future through the education and training of their students.  Thank you!

This amounts to nothing more than a 6 percent pay cut. • The president’s budget proposes to change the calculation for federal pensions to be based on the average of the highest five years of salary instead of the current highest three, which particularly hurts those closest to retirement. • The FERS Annuity Supplement would be eliminated for new retirees starting in fiscal year 2018. • These proposals would diminish the value of federal annuities, threaten the financial security of those just years away from retiring, and generally reduce the quality of life of our nation’s employees and retirees.  Modify Postal Reform Legislation (H.R. 756) (for those who are employees of the U.S. Postal Services)  • Leading postal reform legislation would require all current and future postal retirees to enroll in Medicare and pay additional premiums for that coverage or forfeit their retiree health benefits. • Current postal retirees should retain the choice as to whether to add Medicare to their retiree health benefit coverage. Eliminating that choice breaks a basic promise not to change health benefits in retirement, and increases costs for those on a fixed income. • This legislation would result in a $10.7 billion cost shift to Medicare.  Those who have a Thrifty Savings Plan (the federal government equivalent to a 401k account) should know important changes in the TSP Modernization Act (S. 873/H.R. 3031)  • The TSP Modernization Act (S. 873/H.R. 3031) would expand and create more flexible withdrawal options for Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) participants. • TSP participants have experienced an overly restrictive set of withdrawal rules since the beginning of the TSP 30 years ago, causing participants to transfer their retirement accounts out of the TSP and into higher-fee accounts in exchange for additional options. • The bill would create more options for participants before and during retirement, providing participants increased financial independence and encouraging them to keep their money in the TSP. • This legislation has been approved by committee in each chamber and should be passed by the full House and Senate without delay.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmansablan/photos/a.253162547663.175360.153423912663/10155736439712664/?type=3",NA,1,1,8,0,0,1,0,0

This bill represents another partisan effort to undermine the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which will result in devastating cuts to public health programs.  After weeks of negotiations to reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Community Health Centers (CHCs) and other important public health programs, which have always been bipartisan priorities, the majority have decided to bring a partisan bill to the floor.  This bill will only further delay the reauthorization of these programs, many of which expired on September 30th. The bill passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee at the beginning of October with no Democratic support.  Democrats in Committee instead offered a package that invests in our children and safety net providers, and does not sacrifice the nation’s health. Democrats have made it clear for weeks that the pay-fors in this bill are problematic. Rather than working toward a bipartisan agreement, the majority revised their bill to include even steeper cuts to public health programs.  This bill also seeks to cut $10.5 billion to the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF), zeroing out the fund entirely from 2020 – 2026.  The Prevention Fund was created by the ACA to make national investments in prevention and public health, to improve health outcomes, to enhance health care quality, and reduce health care costs. It has been used to increase awareness of and access to preventive health services, such as cancer screenings, tobacco cessation and childhood vaccines – as well as concentrating on preventing chronic disease to help more Americans stay healthy. Eliminating these funds will have a devastating impact on public health initiatives at the federal, state and local levels, including the Northern Marianas.   While the majority are pushing for tax cuts for the wealthy that explode the deficit, when it comes to health coverage for children and low-income Americans, they are insisting that it be paid for at the cost of weakening our health care system and pushing other Americans off health insurance.  States have begun to use emergency funding, cut benefits, and will soon begin sending disenrollment notices to thousands of families if CHIP is not reauthorized.  The majority’s decision to advance a partisan bill rather than a compromise has very real consequences for families in the Marianas.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmansablan/photos/a.253162547663.175360.153423912663/10155950104222664/?type=3",NA,141,19,53,2,0,5,19,34

E-NAP is the result of the $32.5 million I included for the Marianas in the 2014 Agricultural Act. The funding has allowed the Commonwealth government to add more households to the existing food stamp program and raise benefits. But funding ends this year, fiscal 2018, so more is needed to continue. So far, an additional 314 households have been added to E-NAP, or approximately 1,036 individuals. Benefits have gone up for a household of four on Saipan from $515 per month to $686. On Tinian, the increase was from $568 to $744. On Rota, benefits went from $719 to $897. Tinian and Rota receive higher benefits because of the higher cost of food there. I advocated for this benefit differential with the Food and Nutrition Service at the House Agriculture Committee and it went into effect in 2014. If enacted, H.R. 4216 would provide $42.5 million more for food aid in the Marianas.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmansablan/photos/a.253162547663.175360.153423912663/10155956365832664/?type=3",NA,17,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

Torres a letter of thanks this week for his strong support of H.R. 339, my bill increasing the number of CW permits available for the Marianas in 2017. President Trump signed it into law in August. Public Law 115-53 also blocks the use of CW permits for new construction work to protect local businesses unable to renew their legacy workers. And it adds extra money for training local workers. The Governor testified to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in April that the bill was “necessary and important.” And he agreed that “construction workers could be sourced through H2-B visas.” This could prove crucial, if the Trump administration deeply cuts CW permits for 2018. Many CW permits are now being used by temporary construction workers, who could get the H-2B visa instead.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmansablan/photos/a.253162547663.175360.153423912663/10155956399882664/?type=3",NA,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Lowering electricity costs for families and businesses in the Marianas is a long-standing goal. So, when a national energy bill came before the Natural Resources Committee on Wednesday (above), I offered an amendment to include a study of offshore wind energy in the Marianas. If the study shows wind energy is feasible for electrical generation, then the SECURE American Energy Act, H.R. 4239, authorizes offshore leases to be offered. Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) was kind enough to co-sponsor my amendment, which I wrote to cover American Samoa, too. Wind energy is a proven and cost-effective technology. A 2017 study by the investment firm Lazard found the cost of offshore wind to be $113 per MWh versus $197 for diesel generation. The 2013 Renewable Energy Integration Study, commissioned by the Commonwealth Utilities Corporation, predicted significant cost savings with the addition of renewable energy, including wind, to the CUC system.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmansablan/photos/a.253162547663.175360.153423912663/10155982357962664/?type=3",NA,14,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Passed by Congress in 2005, the REAL ID Act established minimum security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards and prohibits federal agencies, like TSA, from accepting licenses and identification cards for official purposes from states that do not meet these standards.  Enforcement Dates Beginning January 22, 2018, driver’s licenses or state IDs issued by states that are not in compliance with the REAL ID Act and have not been granted an extension by DHS may not be used to fly within the U.S.  Beginning October 1, 2020, every traveler will need a REAL ID-compliant license or state ID or another acceptable form of identification to fly within the U.S.  When Flying… If your state is compliant:  • You may continue to use your state-issued driver’s license or ID to fly in the U.S. until October 1, 2020.   • Beginning October 1, 2020, you may only use a REAL ID compliant driver’s license or ID or another acceptable form of identification for domestic air travel. If your state is not compliant:  • Beginning January 22, 2018, you may continue to use your state-issued driver’s license or ID for domestic air travel only if your state has been granted an extension to the compliance deadline by DHS. If your state has not been granted an extension by DHS you may not use your state-issued driver’s license or ID for domestic air travel.  • Beginning October 1, 2020, you may not use your state-issued driver’s license or ID for domestic air travel.  REAL ID Enforcement: Northern Mariana Islands - UNDER REVIEW  Northern Mariana Islands is currently under review for a renewed extension from REAL ID enforcement.  DHS is currently reviewing extension requests from states with extensions that expired on October 10th, 2017.  DHS will update this page as these reviews are completed and new extensions are granted.  In the meantime, there will be no change in enforcement status for these states.  States will have a grace period until January 22, 2018, meaning that Federal agencies (including TSA) will continue to accept driver’s license and identification cards issued by these states in accordance with each agency’s policies.  Secure driver's licenses and identification documents are a vital component of a holistic national security strategy. Law enforcement must be able to rely on government-issued identification documents and know that the bearer of such a document is who he or she claims to be. REAL ID is a coordinated effort by the states and the Federal Government to improve the reliability and accuracy of state-issued identification documents, which should inhibit terrorists’ ability to evade detection by using fraudulent identification.","link","https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/resources/realid_factsheet.pdf","tsa.gov",15,0,16,0,0,0,0,0

Torres and his staff joined members of the Marianas business community for a meeting with Congressman Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan in Washington on Monday. All agreed that the Trump administration decision to cut the number of CW permits this year to 9,998 was not what they wanted. Looking ahead, Sablan asked the Governor to use his influence with the President to roll back a further cut to 4,999, already announced for next October. “In Congress, we are making good progress on consensus legislation that will ensure the Marianas economy has the labor it needs,” Sablan told the group. “But the Trump administration decision to cut to 4,999 permits in October cuts in half the time we have to act and makes it even more difficult to get a long-term solution into law. Short-term, the decision is also very bad for our economy.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmansablan/photos/a.253162547663.175360.153423912663/10156066848907664/?type=3",NA,17,5,0,0,0,0,1,0

It is regrettable that NMBA came away from our meeting disappointed. Unfortunately, I cannot please everybody. But I do try to listen to the diverse and often conflicting voices that make up our community, many of which claim to speak in the best interests of all the people of the Marianas, and some of which sometimes say they want one thing and then change their minds later. It's not easy, but I signed on to work for the people of the Marianas.     NMBA, as I understand it, is the lobbying arm of the Governor's Strategic Economic Development Council. They came to Washington to advocate for their legislative proposals - a lengthy list of requests. Some of their requests I have already gotten done.      For example, they asked to bar construction workers from the CW program - that was accomplished with the enactment of H.R. 339, the Northern Marianas Economic Expansion Act, thanks in large part to the support of the Governor and the business community. They also asked for a report from the Government Accountability Office on the Marianas' economic prospects, including the impacts of ending the Commonwealth-Only Transitional Worker (CW) program. I requested that report last year, and GAO released the results of their study in May this year.   Some of NMBA's requests, however, will be difficult to sell in this anti-foreign worker, Republican administration and Congress. I have explained this reality to NMBA repeatedly. For example, increasing the CW cap to 18,000 (nearly doubling the number currently in effect) will be a very heavy lift, especially given the relatively high number of unemployed U.S. citizens and residents according to the Commonwealth government’s own data, and the Commonwealth government's record of waiving its own requirements for U.S. hires. Furthermore, splitting the Guam-CNMI visa waiver program, although desired by certain business interests in the Marianas, has nothing to do with an extension of the transition program, and will only distract from, and may even undermine, that effort. I have said this many times - in meetings with NMBA, their individual members, and members from other sectors of the community. Yet NMBA is still pushing for visa waiver bifurcation.   I want to be very clear that NMBA is not the only group I have met with to discuss labor issues. Over the last two years alone, I have also met with the Governor and his staff, the Governor's Strategic Economic Development Council, local legislators, mayors, the Chamber of Commerce, the Hotel Association of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Society of Human  Resource Management, small business owners who do not participate in any associations, U.S. workers and their advocates, CW workers and their advocates, lawyers, journalists, health care professionals, social workers, law enforcement officers, thought leaders, educators, students.    It is my job as Delegate to consult with the people I represent, to sort through their competing interests and concerns, to weigh the available data and facts on the ground, and to make the best decision that I can, based on all of these factors, about the way forward. It is also my job to take the best available information that I have to make our case in Washington, and work with my congressional colleagues to figure out what's possible, what can be achieved to improve the lives of the people I represent.      In Congress, we legislate. And in developing legislation, we negotiate and compromise. That's the nature of the work. Because for a measure to pass, we must have the support of at least 218 Members of the House and a minimum of 51 Senators, whose priorities and concerns may not be in line with our own. And because each Senator can block movement on a bill, the support of key Senators is critical to every legislative effort.   As I have said before in many meetings, press conferences, and news releases, I am now part of a bipartisan, bicameral working group that is developing legislation to carry the Marianas beyond 2019, when the current transition program expires. The working group is led by Senator Lisa Murkowski, who chairs the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which has jurisdiction over the insular areas. The group is still agreeing on the limits that will shape this legislation.   I can say at this time that my priorities are two-fold: 1) to ensure that there is sufficient labor available to keep the Marianas economy moving forward; and 2) to ensure that the number of U.S. workers continues to increase over time. We have made some progress in recruiting, training, and hiring U.S. workers these past nine years since federal immigration law was extended to the Marianas, but as we know, as the data show, we still have a long way to go.   As I tried to explain to NMBA at my meeting on Monday, I am not at liberty to disclose the details of working group conversations that are, at this point, still preliminary, sensitive, and confidential. Building trusting relationships is critical to getting anything done in Congress. Everything I have been able to accomplish in Congress - from labor legislation to boosting funding for education, health care, infrastructure, and food assistance - has been through the strong relationships of trust that I have built on both sides of the aisle these past nine years.   I also explained that I have asked that the working group include the Governor in these talks. When the Chair decides to issue that invitation is not my call, but I understand the Governor’s legislative proposal was transmitted to the Chair some time ago.  I recognize and understand the anxiety in our community about the future, and the need for transparency about the work underway in Washington. I am doing my best to reach out to constituents across our community to make sure that I am hearing a broad range of perspectives. I am pushing to include the Governor in the working group. When legislation is introduced, I want to assure the people I represent that there will be a public hearing and ample opportunity for comment. In the meantime, although I regret that NMBA was not happy after their meeting with me this week, I will continue to welcome their feedback, as I welcome feedback from all constituents about the work I am doing for them.","status",NA,NA,401,25,29,23,0,0,0,0

Making an effort to thank them for their dedication to service is something very important to me this and every holiday season.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/congressmansablan/photos/a.253162547663.175360.153423912663/10156084207342664/?type=3",NA,28,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
