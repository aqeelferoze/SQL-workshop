But it’s clear based on earlier versions of the plan that it will take away health coverage from millions of Americans, gut coverage of essential benefits, lead to higher costs, and once again allow discrimination against Americans with pre-existing conditions.   In Del Norte County, you can see the personal impacts of this TrumpCare bill: more than 3,000 of my constituents rely on the health care they receive through the MediCal expansion under the Affordable Care Act and another 600+ have their health costs subsidized by the Affordable Care Act. All of that is at risk from TrumpCare. It’s for these families, and for the seniors whose premiums who would go up, that I voted NO on TrumpCare last week. I’ll keep fighting to protect the health care of my constituents.","link","http://www.triplicate.com/news/5284938-151/healthcare-district-board-members-ahca-would-hurt-del?referrer=fpblob","triplicate.com",58,18,10,1,0,0,7,9

Today President Trump commemorated the anniversary of President Truman’s commitment, in 1941, to a desegregated military… by deciding to bar transgender individuals from serving in any capacity.

As we get later in the day, the air quality index will rise to UNHEALTHY levels due to wildfire smoke that includes a shifting blend of gases and particles, many of them toxic. Shifting winds across the North Coast and North Bay mean that even if you live in an area not directly impacted by fire, you should still be aware of the health hazards that these fires are creating. Please seek medical help if you have smoke-related symptoms that are worsening or becoming severe, especially for seniors, a child in your care or are pregnant, or if you have existing health conditions.  Some tips to stay safe: minimize your outdoor activities while the air quality alert is ongoing, and stay indoors with the windows closed if you can. If your home has air conditioning or a whole-house fan, make sure that you check the settings so that it is not bringing in air from the outside. If you are planning to buy protective masks for yourself or your family, look for NIOSH-rated masks of N95 or P100 and make sure that you follow the instructions carefully.   https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.local_city&mapcenter=0&cityid=320","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepHuffman/photos/a.243274549144694.1073741827.200227780116038/1249673315171474/?type=3",NA,68,5,54,1,0,4,1,0

That’s especially true with the myriad of conflicts and crises we face on the world stage.  But you cannot lead the free world by being impulsive, unilateral, and unpredictable.  You have signaled for months that the US doesn’t care about humanitarian and moral issues.  You’ve completely ignored a massive humanitarian crisis in east Africa that threatens starvation and death for 20 million people – in fact, you’ve proposed deep cuts to humanitarian aid that would make it worse.  You’ve turned your back on desperate refugees fleeing Assad’s war crimes in Syria.  You’ve signaled that Russia and Assad are free to do whatever they want because it’s not our fight – almost inviting more atrocities in Syria and beyond.  And now you suddenly change your mind -- but it's not clear if it's just this once, or something more.  Was it the images of dying Syrian babies, even though you ignored prior images of dying Syrian babies and all of the dying African babies?  Was it politics – perhaps your historically low poll numbers and complete lack of accomplishment in your first 11 weeks as President?  Was it the fact that oil prices will now magically go up, a boon to your fossil fuel cronies?  Or was it something else – a head fake vis-à-vis Russia in advance of Tillerson's trip, to provide cover for the sanctions relief your team has been pursuing ever since before the election?  We shouldn't have to ask these questions about our President, but with this President, I'm afraid we do.  We have far more questions than answers after last night's airstrikes.  And it underscores, among other things, why Congress must reassert its authority over war decisions as called for by our Constitution.","status",NA,NA,1401,142,953,122,0,5,70,24
