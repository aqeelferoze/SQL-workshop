It was done without Congressional debate or approval in violation of the War Powers Act and the Constitution. Congress should immediately reconvene. When we do we should remember the disastrous history of wars waged by America in the Middle East which killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions more, while nurturing the growth of radical threats like ISIS, Al`Qaeda, Jabhat al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham.  The missile attack appears to be an erratic reaction unconnected to any coherent strategy. Trump says the bombing was in response to the terrible chemical weapon attack on civilians. Yet Trump is unmoved by the deaths of Syrian refugee children at sea and continues to malign and bar Syrian refugee families fleeing the cauldron of war.  The attack is a mistake with potentially disastrous consequences. Any further action must be put before Congress and debated in public with the international and domestic consequences fully considered. When this is done, I expect that Congress will conclude that further military attacks of this sort are the wrong policy.","status",NA,NA,199,26,38,14,0,0,3,1

Some 800,000 DACA recipients brought to the United States as children are today vital members of our communities and economy. They are as American as any of us – except for paperwork. President Trump’s decision to turn his back on them betrays our national character.   The threat of court proceedings is an inadequate excuse. President Trump has never been reluctant to go to court when he thinks it would benefit him. In this instance, over 100 law professors recently affirmed that “the legal authority for the Executive Branch to operate DACA…is crystal clear.”  “The impetus for the President’s action seems just as clear: an extremist, racist agenda. Seventy-eight percent of Americans oppose the deportation of such young people. However, groups tied to the white nationalist movement have long sought DACA’s destruction. Once again, President Trump seems to bend to the will of  extremists rather than mainstream Americans, just as he did while condoning white supremacists in Charlottesville.  Congress must stop this mass deportation of innocent young people. Democratic lawmakers already stand united in our support for DACA recipients, as we do in rejecting attempts to use them as props in broader anti-immigrant legislation. The Dream Act of 2017 (H.R. 3440), which I proudly co-sponsored, would grant them the legal status and path to citizenship that they deserve. The only question is whether Republicans will join the right side of history.   The moral stakes could not be higher.
