August 26, 1920 was the day when the other half of this great nation got the right to vote: the women.  On that day, the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote, was signed by the Secretary of State and thus became a part of the Constitution. It said:   ""The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex...Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.""  But no one was there to see the signing. None of the leaders of the woman suffrage movement who had labored for years for its passage -  were present when the proclamation was signed, and no photographers or film cameras recorded the event.   I think some celebration is a bit overdue. What do you think?  Here’s a brief history.","link","http://www.history.com/topics/womens-history/19th-amendment","history.com",5,0,1,3,0,0,0,0

I was honored to meet her this past April at Hunter College to talk about the need to pass the #EqualRightsAmendment and her work highlighting gender discrimination in the workplace.    Ms. Dukes was the Wal-Mart greeter who brought a class action lawsuit when she realized that she and other women employed by Wal-Mart were facing systematic discrimination. They had evidence showing that women faced systematic discrimination in pay and opportunity, and that management relied on outdated stereotypes and assumptions about their female employees in making hiring and promotion decisions. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court where a sharply divided court ruled that there was not enough evidence of a common employment policy to certify all female employees of Walmart as a class.  In her dissent, Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote: “The plaintiffs’ evidence, including class members’ tales of their own experiences, suggest that gender bias suffused Wal-Mart’s company culture.”  Sadly, the case helped underscore the need for an Equal Rights Amendment to address the gap in pay and opportunities women continue to face.    I welcomed Betty Dukes strong voice in the fight for the Equal Rights Amendment and I am so sorry that she is no longer with us as we continue the fight for an #ERAnow.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepCarolynMaloney/photos/a.411171042333443.1073741828.397176447066236/1341207125996492/?type=3",NA,12,0,1,2,0,0,0,0

It should be a last resort, and we are far from exhausting all available diplomatic options.   Secretary of Defense General James Mattis served more than four decades in the Marine Corps and is known as one of the most influential military leaders of his generation. He has told us that diplomatic efforts to contain the threat posed by North Korea are working, and should remain the favored means for solving the crisis.   I agree we should explore all diplomatic options before taking military action.","status",NA,NA,34,5,5,1,0,0,0,0

No condemnation of Nazis and the anti-Semitism they espouse should end with: ""but….""  No denunciation of White Supremacists and the racial bigotry they embrace should end with: ""on the other hand….""  These hate groups and individuals espouse the worst kind of hatred, bigotry, anti-Semitism. They descended on a quiet college town, hoping for a confrontation. Some of them came armed with assault rifles, brandishing clubs and shields, and waving Nazi flags. Many came wearing helmets, body armor, and military clothing. The violence they sought and the violence they caused is flat out evil. Full stop. No one should suggest that they have the same moral standing as those who opposed them. I have been to Auschwitz in the company of Holocaust survivors.  I have seen where this kind of blind unreasoning hatred can lead if people do not speak out loudly, clearly, and forcefully.  Make no mistake, this weekend’s actions by members of the alt-Right and the KKK-aligned groups that marched in Charlottesville is not the end of this. The hatred that motivated them is still alive in our nation. I am deeply disappointed that our President has refused to clearly and plainly admit this fact. His failure to forcefully condemn these groups is a failure of great significance. It’s also long past time for the President to fire Steve Bannon, who should never have been hired in the first place. We must do better than this as a nation. We must not be silent. In matters as important as this, silence equals consent.","status",NA,NA,34,3,10,3,0,1,0,2

DACA helped breathe life into the American dream for a generation of people who came to the United States as children seeking a better future, just as earlier generations of Americans did so. These individuals are our neighbors and friends who have grown up here in the United States, who have done nothing wrong, and have only ever known the United States as their home. Before DACA, these young people had lived in the shadows of our communities. Since DACA began, these good-hearted Americans have come forward in hopes of being granted fully legal status and the chance to continue making positive contributions to their communities and our country without fear of deportation.   DACA participants bring real economic benefits to our states and nation. A recent Center for American Progress assessment found that ending the DACA program would remove at least $460.3 billion from the U.S. GDP, cumulatively over a decade.   I will continue to do all I can to protect DREAMers and reverse this decision as we continue to work toward real, comprehensive immigration reform.

But ""Edie"" will be remembered by those of us  lucky enough to know her as a warm, energetic, and courageous activist for equal rights, who changed the world for the better for millions, by following her heart and using her head.  Edie was a math wiz, who studied applied math at Harvard and rose through the ranks at IBM to become a Senior Systems Programmer. In a time when it was not easy, she was a woman who had the courage to listen closely to the murmurs of her own heart. After a brief, failed conventional marriage, she moved to my great city of New York, where she knew she would have the freedom to, as she put it, ""let myself be gay.""  Years later, her court victory made it possible for millions of same-sex couples to be married, to visit their loved ones in hospitals, and to enjoy federal recognition for the first time and with it, the numerous federal benefits only available to spouses, like Social Security.  I so enjoyed seeing her at the Stonewall National Monument dedication last June 27, 2016. She was as always, joyful and vibrant, beautiful and caring. The battle for equal rights of our LGBT citizens, had in many ways, begun at Stonewall, led up to the Supreme Court with Edie’s case, and continues to this day.  I think Edie Windsor is best remembered as one of those fortunate souls who can leave this life, knowing with certainty, that her courage and her actions helped to bend the moral arc of this universe a few degrees closer towards justice.

With Cornell Tech’s focus on educating and training the next generation of high-tech leaders and Roosevelt Island’s proximity to Manhattan and to industrial space in Western Queens, this new institution has the potential to change the educational and economic landscape of New York City.  I worked hard to ensure that Cornell Technion was selected when the City was considering locations for the new applied science campus. The community in both Manhattan and Queens were eager to welcome the new campus, and it is clear that Cornell Tech has exceeded everyone’s expectations. The entire Roosevelt Island community is enjoying the beautiful 120,000 square feet of landscaped open space, and our students are already benefitting from Cornell’s partnership with P.S./I.S. 217 on STEM programs. They have truly become a part of our community on Roosevelt Island.  Cornell Tech will help diversify our city’s economic base and bring jobs through new start-ups. Already, there have been 30 new companies created with nearly $20 million in angel funding and venture capital, employing over 100 people. As students are welcomed to the new campus, we know this is just the beginning – and that the future for this institution will be bright.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepCarolynMaloney/photos/a.1328819063901965.1073741832.397176447066236/1390259927757878/?type=3",NA,16,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

Their baby would never be able to breathe on his own.  April was told that if the baby didn’t die in utero – he would surely die shortly after birth from slow suffocation.  April was heartbroken and she desperately hoped the news wasn’t true - so she asked for more tests.Those tests took an additional two weeks. Tragically, the tests confirmed the diagnosis.  So, at 21 weeks, April had an abortion.   With this bill, the federal government would compel every woman like April, against their will, to carry to term a fetus they knew would either be still-born or would suffer needlessly and die at birth.

Sixty-two million American women, including 3.5 million New Yorkers, are benefiting from these protections today.

Instead, we need to pass common sense, effective reforms like universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, and stricter gun trafficking laws. These will help save lives, while at the same time respect the Second Amendment. A strong majority of the American people support these reforms; it’s time that a majority in Congress did so as well.

It would raise taxes on the middle class, double tax New Yorkers, increase the national debt, and lay the ground work for devastating cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.   Right now, New York is the largest donor state in the nation. In 2015 alone, we sent $48 billion more in taxes to the federal government than we received back. Under this new GOP plan, that inequity will become even worse. That is because the GOP bill eliminates the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction while also capping property tax deductions.   The SALT deduction is the most widely used benefit in the tax code in New York. If Congress approves this partial elimination of the SALT deduction, it will create tremendous pressure on state and local governments to cut back funding for schools, infrastructure, health, local law enforcement, and first responders. This tax plan penalizes New Yorkers for taking care of our own. That is totally unacceptable.   I will be voting against this harmful GOP tax hike plan and urging my colleagues to do the same. Our country needs and deserves a far better deal that puts middle class families and protects New Yorkers from this outrageous double taxation plan.","status",NA,NA,11,5,9,0,0,0,1,2

It's also why I have introduced 5 separate gun safety bills to close the gun show background check loophole, allow publicly-funded research into gun violence and how we can prevent it, make gun trafficking a federal offense, require gun owners to own insurance similar to car insurance, and  promote the development of smart gun technology.  You can read more about these efforts on my website.","link","https://maloney.house.gov/issues/gun-safety","maloney.house.gov",24,8,6,0,0,0,0,1
