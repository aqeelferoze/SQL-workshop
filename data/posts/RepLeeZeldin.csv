The Governor's press release fails to state absolutely any acknowledgment whatsoever that the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, is flawed. Nothing at all is included about any of the lost doctors, cancelled policies, higher premiums or higher deductibles that New Yorkers are now facing.   There is no acknowledgment whatsoever that New York's Health Exchange had just one co-op, Health Republic of New York, that collapsed, because the state picked an entity to run it, the Freelancers Union, which had no idea how to create a health care plan so they rented a health plan’s network. They didn't know how to sell the policies so they marked them down and when they realized that their math didn't add up and went to New York State regulators asking for permission to raise their rates, New York told them to make it work, which resulted in (just in time for the 2015 holiday season) a collapse that left over 200,000 New Yorkers without health insurance and providers on the hook with six, seven and eight figures worth of money still owed to them. Many of those impacted New Yorkers who switched policies received the 2016 version of this disaster of a holiday gift repeat as they were notified that their providers were no longer going to honor their new policies.  There is no acknowledgment whatsoever of the cost of the Governor's debacle trying to convert New Yorkers to Managed Long Term Care. In 2011, when a Wall Street Journal article revealed that the New York State Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) was investigating Visiting Nurse Services (VNS) for overbilling New York taxpayers by $224 million in illegal Medicaid claims in 2004-2005, the Governor actually fired the Inspector General at OMIG of all people, while also choosing to promote the CEO of VNS, Carol Raphael, to become his new co-chair of his new Medicaid Redesign Team. Then, with the assumption that all for-profits are evil without exception and all not for profits are doing heroic work without exception, the Medicaid Redesign Team started pushing New Yorkers into Managed Long Term Care and only offered medallions for these services to not for profits. Then, when the New York Times exposed the abuse of this new cronyism as VNS was targeting and signing up healthy people in order to milk the system, the Governor didn't just suspend VNS to cover himself, he suspended the entire signup system so that when the suspension was lifted, VNS would still have enough healthy people left to sign up to game the system, albeit more discreetly.   New York State spends more money on Medicaid than Illinois, Texas and Florida combined. New York has the same population as Florida, but spends more money on Medicaid costs than Florida spends on its entire state budget.  If Governor Cuomo's New Year's Resolution is to start caring more about health care costs, efficiency, and oversight, then he should hunker down in Albany with his budget wizards, and he actually has some extremely talented people like Robert Mujica, to clean this mess, because health care costs in New York are way beyond out of control. He may have his private political contracts with 1199 SEIU to protect him politically, but he wasn't elected Governor of New York to preserve his own political career at any cost even if that means selling out the rest of New York State to cut special deals with his buddies at 1199.  Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced. If Governor Cuomo has a good idea that productively contributes to the future of health care then I'm totally open to listening. In the meantime, he is not part of the solution by conspiring with allies to cook up half baked numbers to scare people about a particular course of action that is divorced from reality. Health care in America must work better and become more affordable, relieving taxpayers of the financial burdens under this failed policy, and give patients more choices, while still continuing to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parent's policy. This is an ongoing process and I am willing to work with anyone on either side of the aisle to strike an appropriate balance not only for Long Island and New York, but for all Americans.   In the meantime, Governor Cuomo needs to dedicate way more of his time getting his own house in order, because it's a house of cards right now that is filling Albany's swamp rather than draining it.","status",NA,NA,146,78,40,7,2,2,1,12

Israel is one of America’s greatest allies and a beacon of freedom and liberty in a very dark region of the world. President Obama lit a menorah this year at the White House and he reflected on Hanukkah as a celebration of the Maccabees’ fight for freedom. The Maccabees lived, prayed and fought on the land that this Security Council resolution calls illegally occupied territory and yet this resolution was passed the day before the start of Hanukkah. The Obama administration, by allowing this resolution to pass, is attempting a dangerous shift in American foreign policy that cannot be allowed to stand. The Israelis have long been willing to compromise large swaths of land in this region in pursuit of a two state solution. It has been the Palestinians who have time and again declined real offers on the table for their own state. Just think about this reality…if the Israelis agreed right now to make all of the concessions this UN Security Council resolution calls for, there would still not be peace. A viable two state solution isn’t just about Israel recognizing the Palestinians right to exist, it’s also about the Palestinians recognizing Israel’s right to exist. It is the Palestinians who financially reward terrorists for murdering innocent Americans and innocent Israelis. The United States should suspend foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority, move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. It is the Palestinians who if they had an election today, Hamas would win. This is an entity that has committed not to rest unless Israel is wiped off the map. In 2015, I was in Ramallah and met with the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority who said to me without exception or hesitation that he would never recognize Israel as a Jewish state. These are just some of the realities Israel are up against. As for me, I stand for freedom and America should stand strong, shoulder to shoulder, with Israel.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ybp-mQgAlcw&feature=youtu.be","video","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ybp-mQgAlcw&feature=youtu.be",NA,152,14,31,11,0,0,0,0

What I am eager to be assured of though is that he is actually going to do everything that needs to be done about it. The President-elect has constantly committed over and over again towards reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs and has shown a solid understanding of what needs to be fixed at the VA, while consistently reaffirming his commitment towards actually making those much needed changes. I would hope and expect that the President, Congress, media and American public will hold Dr. Shulkin's feet to the fire to ensure he follows through and does not fail in any capacity whatsoever with this new mission. He certainly wasn't my number one pick to be the next Secretary of Veterans Affairs, but I'll be the first in line to shake his hand and say thank you if he seizes this opportunity and makes the absolute most of it in the best interests of Long Island's veterans, the Northport VA and the entire community nationally of all America's sons and daughters who answered the call to serve our great country in defense of our freedoms and liberties.","link","https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-zeldin-statement-president-elect-trump-s-secretary-va-nomination","zeldin.house.gov",68,8,11,5,0,0,0,0

Some in favor of repeal. Others opposed. I appreciate them bringing attention to this important issue. I have consistently remained in favor of repeal and have never been more sure of this urgent necessity.  Obamacare has been nothing short of a disaster for countless hardworking families and our economy. The system has failed and it’s only going to get worse. Obamacare has resulted in higher premiums, higher deductibles, lost doctors, and cancelled policies, among many other challenges. Businesses on Long Island and across the nation have been forced  to reduce their workforce, cut hours, and even go out of business. Even worse, roughly one third of the counties in the U.S. have only one choice within the exchange, meaning there is no competition in the marketplace whatsoever. With the collapse of Health Republic in New York, which left over 200,000 individuals and businesses in New York without insurance coverage unexpectedly, as well as the collapse of dozens of other co-ops across the country, it has become increasingly clear that this law is deeply flawed.   In order to fix healthcare in America, we must repeal this flawed law, stabilize skyrocketing premiums and provide relief to hardworking Americans. There should be a stable transition to a new reality that will work better and make healthcare costs affordable, relieving taxpayers of the financial burdens under this failed policy, and give patients more choices, while still continuing to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parent's policy. This is a multi-step process which is expected to begin this week. While moving to patient centered healthcare that gives Americans access to quality affordable care, I, along with my Republican colleagues, remain committed to providing relief to those struggling with the effects of Obamacare.","status",NA,NA,163,89,19,15,1,0,0,22

These were my prepared remarks:  “Thank you Rev. Liggon and Rev. Coverdale, and thank you to everyone here to celebrate Martin Luther King Day; honoring one of the greatest heroes in the history of our nation.    Dr. King dedicated his life to the pursuit of justice, freedom and opportunity for all Americans - peacefully fighting social injustice and spreading the message of love and respect across our country.   He said that 'Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.' Dr. King encouraged fierce but peaceful protest of injustice, and acted selflessly in the fight against hate and intolerance. He taught us that nonviolence can be our greatest weapon in the struggle against prejudice.    With racial tensions high in our country today, we must not only reflect on Dr. King’s message of unity and respect, but also recommit ourselves to doing our part.    Across our country, hostility and deadly clashes have taken place all too often between citizens and fellow citizens, as well as citizens and law enforcement. We cannot allow this to tear our nation apart.   Challenges exist, but so do solutions, community, unity, prayer and common purpose. Dr. King believed that violence begets violence, and that racial tensions could only be truly overcome through peaceful discussion. All Americans, regardless of race, gender, socioeconomic status, or religion, must bind together in these trying times for our nation to move forward stronger.    Our nation is fractured, but it does not always have to be this way. I know that we can enter a new day where no one is targeted because of the color of their skin, or for their uniform. We owe it to Dr. King to see his dream of a society unburdened by racism and prejudice become a reality.   Thank you again, Reverends, for allowing me to join you on this day.    Today, we honor you Dr. King, we thank you, one of the greatest Americans of all time, whose powerful message of love and unity inspires me, inspires everyone else in attendance here this morning and all others paying tribute to you today and everyday all across the land of this country that may not have been the greatest nation in the world if not for you.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepLeeZeldin/photos/a.387918101376980.1073741828.386192271549563/697217633780357/?type=3",NA,71,9,9,1,0,0,0,0

I have read the TPP, and this flawed international agreement has been appropriately coined 'NAFTA on Steroids'.   Trade is vital to the U.S. economy, but the entire process of negotiating trade agreements needs to improve. In reality, Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation should be passed before a negotiation is started, not five years into negotiations. Negotiating objectives should be set before negotiating, not towards the end. Furthermore, the process of turning off 'fast track' should be made remarkably simple if negotiating objectives aren’t met. There also needs to be a process along the way that assures the American public that the negotiating objectives are being strictly and completely adhered to.   With over 38 million American jobs tied to trade, trade is a driving force in our economy. We need to advance trade deals that level the playing field so that American workers, families and businesses can compete and win in the global marketplace. American exceptionalism is the United States taking the lead in the global economy. We must advance policies that increase GDP, boost a trade surplus, and export American goods, not American jobs, in order to strengthen our economy and security. Growth opportunities are currently abroad with 96 percent of the world’s customers living outside our nation’s borders. Now is not too early or too late to recalibrate and re-engage in a way that the American public feels like their voices and input are being heard and that their representatives in Congress are setting the conditions and not just going along to get along. I look forward to working with everyone - our President, Congress, employers and employees, the CEO and the regular Joe - and get on the same page where the people’s voice is leading the way with a trade agenda that we are all more invested in and proud of.   Working together, we must continue to insist on advancing trade agreements that strengthen the middle class, place America first, and deliver more opportunities to hardworking American families. We must ensure that any trade deals entered into by the United States are in the absolute best interest of the American economy, American companies, and the American worker.

With a new year, new president and new Congress, there are many opportunities to advance legislation and other initiatives to improve the direction of our country.  Keeping Americans safe, secure and free must always be our first priority. This includes training and equipping the greatest military in the world and ensuring our law enforcement has all of the tools it needs to protect our communities and country. In 2017, we need to pursue a stronger, more consistent foreign policy, which strengthens our relationships with our relationships with our allies and treats our adversaries as our adversaries. Especially important is the need to defeat ISIS and other terrorist threats, which includes the need to stop foreign fighter travel; a goal that Congress can help accomplish by passing my Counterterrorism Screening and Assistance Act. There is much more that can be done to secure our homeland, which includes improving our nation’s immigration system. While there are many challenges that exist regarding immigration, we must start by advancing proposals to secure our border and strengthen interior enforcement. America is a nation of immigrants and everyone should have the opportunity to pursue the American dream, but you must come to the United States legally and follow the rules.   In Congress, one of my top priorities has always been to help grow our economy and create more good paying private sector jobs. We must reform and consolidate our broken tax code, which has become far too complicated and uncompetitive in the global economy. By consolidating the system with less tax brackets, there will be a direct benefit to the American economy, American companies, and the American worker. We should also simplify the tax code so that more Americans can do their taxes on a form as simple as a postcard. Another way to keep the U.S. competitive in the global marketplace is by ensuring that any trade deals entered into by the United States place America first and level the playing field so that American workers, families and businesses can compete and win in the global marketplace. We must also boost “Made in America” products to keep good paying jobs here. To further improve the business climate in the U.S., we must shut-down job killing red tape and harmful regulations hurting employers and employees, which includes getting the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act (H.R. 26) signed into law.   Supporting our veterans and first responders must also remain a high priority. These brave men and women, who willingly and selflessly put their lives on the line while defending us, deserve nothing but the highest quality of life and care. Working across the aisle, I will re-introduce and push forward my bills to increase care for our veterans, including my bill to expand nationally the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Veteran Peer Support Program, or “Dwyer Program,” so that every struggling veteran across the country eventually has access to a peer support group. I will also work closely with my colleagues to ensure a timely and proper delivery of healthcare for our 9/11 first responders who are now sick or will become sick as a result of their selfless efforts at Ground Zero in the weeks and months that followed the attacks. Furthermore, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) needs to be reformed to better serve our nation’s heroes. We have to ensure that each and every veteran who goes to the VA is receiving the quality of care that they deserve and that VA officials are given the resources and flexibility needed to hold poor performing employees accountable.  There are so many ways that we can improve the quality of education in our schools. Rolling back the excessive amount of federally-mandated testing in grade schools to shift the focus in our classrooms from testing to teaching is key to ensuring our students are set up to succeed. By passing the Student Testing Improvement and Accountability Act, testing will be reduced to pre-No Child Left Behind levels and our children’s education and well-being will be put first. Advancing the investment in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in our schools is also critical. STEM is vital to the education of our youth and the future of our country in the 21st century; preparing students in our communities to pursue good paying jobs will contribute to economic growth, increase innovation and allow us to remain competitive in the global marketplace. Furthermore, modernizing student loan debt financing is an important step to improve higher education. I will be re-introducing my bill, the Earnings Contingent Education Loans (ExCEL) Act, to replace the broken student loan system with an individualized loan repayment program tailored to each student's needs.  In the U.S., too much of our infrastructure is in need of additional support. Working with the new administration and Congress, we can repair our nation’s infrastructure and further address vulnerabilities and opportunities for improvement through sensible policies, including the use of more public-private partnerships, to strengthen our roads, bridges and other forms of infrastructure. We also must physically secure all of our nation’s infrastructure from threats of terrorism and Mother Nature. Through collaboration with the Army Corps of Engineers, we can advance projects to boost coastal resiliency and our waterways using the natural environment to reduce flooding, erosion, and storm damage, while preserving the natural environment and wildlife.  Improving healthcare in America is also a top priority. Obamacare has been nothing short of a disaster for countless hardworking families and our economy. The system has failed and it’s only going to get worse. We must repeal and replace Obamacare with a new reality that will work better and make healthcare more affordable, while continuing to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parent's policy. It’s also essential that we preserve and protect Seniors’ access to Medicare to ensure that benefits are not cut, and seniors receive the benefits and care they need and have earned. Congress should also continue to help those coping with mental health issues and/or drug addiction by further increasing treatment and recovery services, and education measures, and address the drug crisis by stopping the flow of illegal narcotics into our country, and helping law enforcement identify and target drug traffickers.  Safeguarding our environment is important to our life, culture and economy. Every American should have access to clean air and clean water, and we must protect and preserve our abundance of natural resources. In Congress, one of my highest priorities is to ensure we pursue a better direction for Plum Island, a cultural, historical, ecological, and natural resource. I will continue working to advance my bill to ensure we pursue a better direction that allows for continued research, public access and permanent preservation of the island. Fishing is another essential part of our culture and heritage, which is why I am focused on improving the management of our fisheries and reforming our current fisheries laws, while sacrificing none of the environmental and economic benefits of continuing to rebuild coastal fish stocks.  This year, I will continue working to secure more victories through my New Era of American Strength agenda. It has been an honor to represent the First Congressional District of New York, and I am looking forward to pursuing all of these great opportunities and more for our community, state and nation.","status",NA,NA,70,32,20,3,0,0,3,1

While there will always be differences which separate us, we must not allow these divisions to devolve into violence against others. The injustices we face must be protested, but in a way that encourages discussion and debate, not further bloodshed. The Holocaust ended because of those who witnessed injustice chose to stand up and not remain silent.   This must never happen again. We must continue to share the stories of those who have lived through this tragedy to teach future generations what happens when hatred prevails.

While a new president and new Congress debate legislation and other policy with a national and international focus, there are also some local priorities that are very important to us all as well here on the east end of Long Island. In this first of a two part op-ed, I will highlight some security, economic, veterans and law enforcement priorities impacting NY-1.  A top priority must always be to secure our communities from threats posed by dangerous individuals and illegal and abused narcotics. We have very real, ongoing homeland security threats within our own borders and we, as a community, must remain ever vigilant. Additionally, from a security perspective, curbing the drug epidemic in Suffolk County includes targeted enforcement to stop the flow of illegal narcotics into our country to keep drugs out of our communities and off of our streets. Much more can be done to keep our district safe, and we must ensure law enforcement personnel have every tool necessary to protect us. We must also address the serious risks posed to Long Island by the rising threat of cyber attacks. Many aspects of life have become computerized and without a substantial boost to cybersecurity capabilities, our local businesses, individuals, and government infrastructure are left vulnerable.   We must also continue to pursue solutions that help grow our middle class and improve the business climate within our district. The high cost of living on Long Island is one of the most commonly shared challenges we face. We must especially do everything possible to make Long Island more affordable for our seniors and young families. This can be assisted through tax relief and efforts to shut-down job killing red tape, such as the Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, which has recently passed the House. When businesses grow and stay local, they will create more good paying, private sector jobs, expand the middle class, and improve liquidity throughout our local economy. This includes supporting our local farmers. The agriculture industry is such an important part of our life and culture here on Long Island that has been negatively impacted by red tape, which is why I’ve supported legislation, such as the Young Farmers Success Act. This bipartisan bill would add farmers to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which would help our local family farms and the young farmers in our district where the next generation has to choose between taking over the family business or paying their student loans. I’ve also been outspoken about the need to repeal the death tax, which causes one-third of all family-owned small businesses to liquidate after the death of the owner. It is also critical that we improve the management of our fisheries by making necessary reforms to our current fishing laws. We must reinvigorate Long Island’s tradition of saltwater fishing by clarifying federal regulations and reducing unneeded restrictions. Additionally, the local science community, including Brookhaven National Laboratory, Stony Brook University, and other facilities, is an important economic factor and serves as some of the largest employers within our district. Efforts to secure funding to continue their great research also serves as a boost to our local economy.  Fighting for our veterans and first responders is also a priority for our district. Suffolk County has the highest population of veterans by county in New York State, as well as one of the highest in the entire country. These brave men and women deserve nothing but the highest quality of life and care. Veterans across New York are now able to receive assistance coping with PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) through the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Veterans Peer Support Program, a peer-to-peer support program for veterans I established while serving in the State Senate. We must also do more to ensure every veteran has a roof over their head. No veteran should ever be left homeless. There are also various issues at the VA facility in Northport that need to be addressed. Reforms at the VA from the national level to local level will help ensure no veteran is ever underserved. The VA must be held accountable to Congress, the media and American public, but most importantly, to our veterans. I will also be working closely with my colleagues to ensure 9/11 first responders, many of whom live in our district, receive timely and proper delivery of health care for illnesses caused as a result of their selfless efforts at Ground Zero in the weeks and months that followed the attacks.   Our security, economy, veterans and law enforcement are some of the highest priorities to focus our local efforts on in 2017 and beyond. While there has been great past progress to write about, what is most important is to identify and tackle the many ways to do even more with each day and opportunity ahead.","status",NA,NA,58,51,8,3,0,0,0,0

Passing this bill is an important way that we can help expand care for disabled veterans on Long Island and across our country. By providing disabled veterans with access to Adult Day Health Care, we can ensure that all veterans receive the best and most efficient outpatient services to provide them with the assistance and special attention that they need in their day to day lives, while still allowing them to maintain their independence. Adult Day Health Care programs allow veterans to lead a much more fulfilling life, and also helps keep families together and strong, while simultaneously reducing overall healthcare costs for the veteran. I will continue the fight in Congress to expand Adult Day Health Care for our disabled veterans to ensure that all veterans receive the proper treatment and care they deserve after fighting for our country.   https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-zeldin-re-introduces-bill-help-severely-disabled-veterans","link","https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-zeldin-re-introduces-bill-help-severely-disabled-veterans","zeldin.house.gov",134,39,19,9,0,0,0,1

Last Congress, this bill passed the House with unanimous bipartisan support as H.R. 3070, the EEZ Clarification Act. One of the top legislative priorities of Long Island fishermen is the need to clarify the federal regulations regarding striped bass fishing in the small area of federally controlled waters between Montauk Point and Block Island. The Local Fishing Access Act would eliminate the regulatory confusion hurting the hardworking, responsible men and women of the region’s struggling fishing communities, while freeing up Coast Guard and other law enforcement resources that are diverted from more critical missions, such as national security and vessel safety. Fishing is an important industry and way of life on Long Island, and Congress should do everything possible to ensure business owners can survive. I will continue working to get this bill passed and signed into law to provide common sense relief for our local fishermen.

Today, decades after the Holocaust, there remains a rising tide of anti-Semitism across our country and world. There has been an alarming rise in the number of reprehensible acts against the American Jewish community, specifically the anonymous bomb threats made by telephone and email against Jewish Community Centers across our nation. Additionally, there have been many reported incidents of property crimes carried out with the intent to desecrate or destroy sacred religious symbols, which ultimately attempt to intimidate Jewish Americans. As key leaders responsible for our national security, the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice must work to stop these acts of violence and hatred based on religion or race.

While these are some of my highest priorities in 2017, there are still a number of other important areas where we can advance the direction of our district in the coming years. In this second part of my two part op-ed, I will focus on the education, infrastructure, healthcare, and environmental priorities facing our district.  There are so many ways we can improve the quality of education for Long Island’s students. This Congress, I am reintroducing the Student Testing Improvement and Accountability Act to reduce testing to pre-No Child Left Behind levels and shift the focus from testing to teaching in our Long Island classrooms. I also remain committed to advancing legislation to boost Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programs to prepare students in our communities for jobs in the 21st Century. We are so fortunate to have a vibrant science community on Long Island with centers such as Brookhaven National Laboratory and Stony Brook University. In response to the student debt crisis, I will reintroduce the Earnings Contingent Education Loans (ExCEL) Act to replace the current broken student loan system with an individualized loan repayment program tailored to our students’ needs. I will also be working hard to expand Pell Grants for higher education. A recent study has shown that the average graduate in New York has over $32,000 in student debt; this crisis must be swiftly addressed.  Long Island’s infrastructure is in critical need of continued support. Last Congress, I got my Safe Bridges Act signed into law as part of a five year, fully funded highway bill. Under the Safe Bridges Act, over 80 bridges and overpasses across the First Congressional District are eligible once again for federal funding. I will continue to drive funding from this bill to local infrastructure projects, such as Hospital Road Bridge. We must also modernize and stabilize the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to better help Long Islanders threatened by storms and floods, as well as to encourage mitigation and improve transparency within the NFIP. Air travel is very important to many Long Islanders, and my office and I will be working with local airports like MacArthur and Gabreski to improve travel options within the district, but we also must mitigate aircraft noise over the East End, especially for residents of the North Fork.  We must also improve health care on Long Island as a top priority. Obamacare has been nothing short of a disaster for countless hardworking families and our economy. This flawed law has resulted in higher deductibles, higher premiums, cancelled policies, less choices and lost doctors, among many other challenges. We must repeal and replace Obamacare with a new reality that will work better and make healthcare more affordable for Long Islanders, while continuing to cover those with pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parent's policy. I will also be working to ensure facilities such as Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Laboratory have the funding necessary to continue to advance life saving research and technologies. Additionally, here in Suffolk County, our communities and families have been severely impacted by the rise of prescription drug abuse and the growing heroin crisis. Last year, Congress passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, which was signed into law, to help combat the heroin and opioid epidemic through community-based education, prevention, treatment and recovery programs. I will continue working with local elected officials, law enforcement, health professionals, community groups, parents, concerned residents and those in recovery, to discuss and develop a more localized solution to address this crisis by increasing treatment and recovery services, education, and stopping the influx of illegal substances.  Our environment and natural resources are so important to our life, culture, and economy here on Long Island. All Americans should have access to clean air and water, which is why I have been working tirelessly over the past two years to protect our natural treasures. I am a member of several environmental congressional caucuses, including the Climate Solutions Caucus that explores policy options to address our changing climate. It is critical that we continue to protect Long Island’s waterways through efforts to reduce nitrogen pollution, improve local wastewater treatment infrastructure, and utilize new septic technology, with the goal of clean water for all. One of my highest priorities in Congress is to pursue a better direction for Plum Island. This island is cherished by the local community for its abundance in cultural, historical, ecological, and natural resources. I will continue working to advance my bill, that passed the House last Congress, to ensure continued research, public access and permanent preservation for Plum Island. Working with the Army Corps of Engineers, we will also advance essential dredging and shoreline projects, including the Fire Island to Montauk Point (FIMP) Project.  We have made some great progress in the past few years advancing local priorities, but there remains important work still ahead. I look forward to taking on these challenges in the coming months and years.","status",NA,NA,52,76,8,4,1,0,0,0

I also requested that the VA recruit a new facility director from outside the Northport VAMC system. Over the years, I have always heard high praise from veterans across Long Island who have had nothing but a very positive experience at the Northport VA; however, there have been specific and very serious allegations that have been made to my office, which cannot be ignored. In light of any pending investigatory matters, I respectfully submit that the most prudent course of action to replace Mr. Moschitta would be to recruit a new facility director from outside the Northport VAMC system. Northport VAMC serves the largest concentration of veterans in New York andis critical to meeting the current healthcare needs of many in our veteran community. New, strong leadership is needed to right this ship and restore the trust that has been damaged by past events. In addition to the troubling, but not insurmountable personnel allegations that exist at Northport VAMC, they are further in need of critical infrastructure and maintenance projects, which have not been addressed by the Department. We must create a leadership system, both at Northport and throughout the entire VA system, which allows VA employees to serve veterans to the best of their abilities while holding accountable those who are not acting in the best interest of our nation’s veterans. We cannot continue to perpetuate the same mistakes that have plagued the VA for years on end. Ensuring our veterans have only the highest quality of care is one of my highest priorities in Congress.   https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-zeldin-calls-replacement-retiring-northport-va-director-new","link","https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-zeldin-calls-replacement-retiring-northport-va-director-new","zeldin.house.gov",49,11,8,4,0,0,0,0

My legislation will provide a commonsense clarification to existing law to ensure that those in the Medicare program do not have to go through the difficulty of adjusting to new rules and pricing arbitrarily reached by CMS to receive equipment that they need.

The Dodd-Frank Act, however, has done the opposite. Over the past 6 years, this law has had a negative impact on the American economy and American worker. Young families are stuck raising a family in their parent’s basement because even though they are credit worthy, new onerous regulations like the qualified mortgage rule mean they can’t afford a down payment or get a mortgage from a local bank. Community bankers who have been serving local businesses and families now can’t afford to stay in business because of the significant compliance costs imposed on them by Dodd-Frank. They have to lay-off employees or sell to a larger firm because this “compliance tax” has squeezed them so severely. Some reports show the U.S. economy losing one community bank or credit union per day. Since Dodd-Frank was enacted, the loss of market share for community banks has doubled. While the purpose of Dodd-Frank was not to make big banks bigger and small banks fewer, that is exactly what happened. ""Too big to fail"" is being perpetuated as bad actors know that U.S. taxpayers will be forced by law to bail them out whenever needed. A hardworking person who might not have perfect credit can’t get an auto loan, and the auto finance firm, which is also a small business, can’t help him or her because of regulations imposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Regulation is necessary, but not bad regulation that leads to the opposite effect of what was intended. Have you found credit harder to obtain for everyday expenses, an auto loan, or even a home mortgage? Have you lost your free checking? Has Dodd-Frank prevented growth in your small business?

This legislation is supported and being strongly advocated for by the President and his new administration. I am supportive of many aspects of this bill as written. I will continue to monitor this bill very closely over the next few days.  I strongly believe that it is so important that whatever happens, there must be a smooth transition to a better reality that will improve affordability, access, quality of care and options, while continuing to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parent's policy.  Obamacare has resulted in higher premiums, higher deductibles, lost doctors, and cancelled policies, among many other challenges. Deductibles are so high, many people now feel like they don’t even have insurance anymore. One-third of the counties in our country only have one option left under the exchange. That’s not choice. That’s a monopoly.    There were so many broken promises. We were told that if you like your plan, you can keep it and that if you like your doctor that you could keep your doctor. We were assured that Obamacare would reduce the deficit, and that insurance premiums would go down $2,500 per family. All of this was untrue.  The American Health Care Act provides relief from the significant amount of taxes and mandates enacted under the ACA, eliminating all ACA taxes. Additionally, the bill repeals the individual and employer mandates, taxes on prescription and over the counter medications, health insurance premiums and medical devices.  This budget reconciliation legislation is the first step of a three step process. Step two is administrative action to ensure a smooth transition. Step three will be additional legislative action, which could also come as early as this week.    One of my biggest concerns right now is the amount of people making untruthful and misleading claims about the bill in the attempt to undermine efforts to repeal and replace the ACA. Here are some examples of those claims:    1.The bill would drop low income Americans from the Medicaid rolls. - The current expansion plan will not kick any beneficiary off Medicaid. The current plan is to keep the enhanced match (90% from the feds for NYS) until 2020. At that point, states will get their normal Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, otherwise known as FMAP, (50% for NYS) for the expansion population. A state will continue to receive the enhanced match (90%) after 2020 for any expansion beneficiary until they are no longer on Medicaid.  2. Premiums are going to rise as a result of the AHCA being passed - While the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report states that premiums may slightly increase in 2018 and 2019, the report also states that by 2026 premiums will actually be 10% less than premiums would be under current law.  3. Republicans are not focused on making improvements to the current law. They only want to irresponsibly gut it all - For example, the American Health Care Act continues to cover individuals with pre-existing conditions, allows children to stay on their parents plan until age 26, maintains a ban on lifetime or annual limits, keeps the Medicare Part D donut hole closed, and prevents insurance companies from charging women more than men.  4. New York’s seniors will be unfairly targeted - Actually, the American Health Care Act in its present form, when coupled with current New York state law, results in a very beneficial targeting for seniors. New York State already has laws on the books which maintain balanced coverage for all New York residents.    5. 24 Million Americans would lose their health insurance - This CBO conclusion is primarily because individuals will be free to choose whether or not to obtain health insurance without penalty; as it should be. The scope of the CBO score is also limited to just this legislation, which only represents one third of the total approach to reform healthcare.  As we discussed earlier, this is a three-pronged process that includes action from the Administration as well as several other pieces of legislation which will all impact the volume of individuals covered.  There are other necessary reforms to healthcare that can’t be accomplished through the budget reconciliation process. This includes allowing policies to be sold across state lines, lowering drug costs for patients, allowing for the pooling of policies, providing additional flexibility in Medicaid for states to manage their own programs as effectively as possible, and medical legal reforms.

The Collins-Faso amendment doesn't even include any cuts to hospitals whatsoever. The amendment is a proposal to shift to the state the local share of Medicaid from the counties outside of New York City, including Suffolk County. It does not propose a $2.3 billion cut. Governor Cuomo is choosing on his own to react to the amendment, by threatening a cut to scare people. Let’s call this for exactly what it is.  Furthermore, Governor Cuomo is completely lying about the Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payment cut after I specifically explained this to him in detail on a 30 minute one on one phone call yesterday. The DSH cuts are part of federal law under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). If Congress does absolutely nothing, hospitals would still receive those DSH cuts, not because of the American Health Care Act, but because those cuts are already part of federal law under the ACA. It’s also crazy that he would be using the tactics in this press release when he has short changed these hospitals out of so much more money owed to them throughout the years.  Governor Cuomo's own father knew that the Collins-Faso amendment should be implemented in New York State when he proposed it 23 years ago while Mario Cuomo was Governor (http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/18/opinion/mr-cuomo-s-medicaid-cure.html). Does the Governor believe that Mario Cuomo was a ""radical conservative"" as Governor as well? Of course not.  Between the Governor's scams associated with his conversion to managed long term care in New York, his private contracts with 1199 SEIU, his failed Health Republic experiment, and his mishandling of Medicaid issues related to Visiting Nurse Services, he really should be looking in the mirror and deciding whether his $60 billion a year Medicaid budget has $2.3 billion in efficiencies to be pursued that he knows wouldn’t hurt any low income New Yorkers. If he needs any advice on how to get there, I'd be happy to help point him in the right direction. These scare tactics and lies about the Collins-Faso amendment are shameful and disgusting. It is like he has checked out on doing the tough work as Governor to make New York State operate like a well-oiled machine again.    Our county governments around the state desperately need this mandate relief. This amendment to the American Health Care Act is the single greatest act of fiscal relief ever provided to the County of Suffolk and its taxpayers. This legislation single handily flips Suffolk County's recurring massive nine figure budget deficits into budget surpluses. Taxpayers in Suffolk County are hitting the jackpot of mandate relief as a result of this proposal. For the County, and most importantly, Suffolk County residents, this is a dream scenario that lifts our county out of a very dire annual budget crisis. According to the Suffolk County Comptroller’s Office, this would save Suffolk County $4.6 million per week. New York State absolutely can and should identify and achieve the $2.3 billion amount of efficiency necessary and available in the state Medicaid system and make it clear that this can be achieved without harming any low income New Yorkers in need of coverage. If the state needs any ideas, I stand more than happy to assist.  The Governor's statements and press releases always fail to state absolutely any acknowledgment whatsoever that the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, is flawed. Nothing at all is ever included about any of the lost doctors, cancelled policies, higher premiums or higher deductibles that New Yorkers are now facing.    There is never any acknowledgment whatsoever that New York's Health Exchange had just one co-op, Health Republic of New York, that collapsed, because the state picked an entity to run it, the Freelancers Union, which had no idea how to create a health care plan so they rented a health plan’s network. They didn't know how to sell the policies so they marked them down and when they realized that their math didn't add up and went to New York State regulators asking for permission to raise their rates, New York told them to make it work, which resulted in (just in time for the 2015 holiday season) a collapse that left over 200,000 New Yorkers without health insurance and providers on the hook with six, seven and eight figures worth of money still owed to them. Many of those impacted New Yorkers who switched policies received the 2016 version of this disaster of a holiday gift repeat as they were notified that their providers were no longer going to honor their new policies.  There is never any acknowledgment whatsoever of the cost of the Governor's debacle trying to convert New Yorkers to Managed Long Term Care. In 2011, when a Wall Street Journal article revealed that the New York State Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) was investigating Visiting Nurse Services (VNS) for overbilling New York taxpayers by $224 million in illegal Medicaid claims in 2004-2005, the Governor actually fired the Inspector General at OMIG of all people, while also choosing to promote the CEO of VNS, Carol Raphael, to become his new co-chair of his new Medicaid Redesign Team. Then, with the assumption that all for-profits are evil without exception and all not for profits are doing heroic work without exception, the Medicaid Redesign Team started pushing New Yorkers into Managed Long Term Care and only offered medallions for these services to not for profits. Then, when the New York Times exposed the abuse of this new cronyism as VNS was targeting and signing up healthy people in order to milk the system, the Governor didn't just suspend VNS to cover himself, he suspended the entire signup system so that when the suspension was lifted, VNS would still have enough healthy people left to sign up to game the system, albeit more discreetly.    New York State spends more money on Medicaid than Illinois, Texas and Florida combined. New York has the same population as Florida, but spends more money on Medicaid costs than Florida spends on its entire state budget.  As I have stated previously, the Governor really needs to dedicate way more of his time getting his own house in order, because it's a house of cards right now that is filling Albany's swamp rather than draining it.”","status",NA,NA,83,171,45,5,0,1,3,22

""It is an absolutely undeniable fact that the Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payment cut is actually part of the current federal law that was included in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), otherwise known as Obamacare,"" Congressman Zeldin said. ""In other words, if Congress did absolutely nothing to change federal law, the DSH cuts that are being referenced by Governor Cuomo and hospital CEOs would still kick in. To put it another way, there is nothing in the American Health Care Act, including the Collins-Faso Amendment, that is creating these DSH cuts. Ironically, it is already in the very law, the ACA, that Governor Cuomo is saying and doing absolutely anything at all in order to defend. His claims are not just ironic and hypocritical. They are an outright lie. It is even more disturbing and unfortunate that hospital CEOs have chosen to also advance this same blatant falsehood. As a result of President Obama’s signature healthcare law, and not the American Health Care Act, hospitals stand to lose incredibly high sums of reimbursable expenses by October 1, 2017. This is a black and white fact currently written into federal statute as part of the ACA. The best path forward for Governor Cuomo would be to approach Congressional Republicans to genuinely work with them as opposed to continuing to pound his chest with tall tales about reality. His entire approach insists on avoiding bipartisan at any cost.""","status",NA,NA,115,218,49,6,0,2,0,26

Our tax code is complicated, with seven brackets and countless rules, resulting in an overcomplicated and confusing maze. Our tax code is uncompetitive globally with companies, jobs and liquidity moving abroad. There is absolutely no better time than the present for bold, pro growth reform that improves our business climate, and creates more good paying, private sector jobs.   America is the greatest nation in the world because we give our citizens the opportunity to work hard and succeed on one’s own merit. However, a burdensome and confusing tax code strips away this opportunity, and it will only get worse unless we take action to fix it. The solution is simple: a tax code that is flatter, fairer, and spurs investment and job creation in the United States instead of overseas. With a new President and Congress, we have the opportunity to reform and simplify our broken tax code so that more Americans can do their taxes on a form as simple as a postcard. We have a once in a generation opportunity to build a tax code that focuses on simplicity and fairness for individuals and families, and growth and job creation for the businesses that keep our nation’s economy moving.    President Ronald Reagan’s words decades ago about our nation’s tax code still ring true today. He described the code as full of “loopholes designed for those with the power and influence to hire high-priced legal and tax advisers” and he was right. Anyone who has ever filled out a tax form knows that the entire system is a convoluted mess that needs to be simplified. On top of this, the structure allows for special interest breaks while the average American family struggles to make ends meet. The obvious solution is to reduce the reliance on an endless list of complicated deductions and credits that benefit one special interest over another and confuse the average taxpayer. The goal should be for more hardworking families to actually see the fruits of their labor.  A higher standard deduction is being proposed as part of the solution. This would mean less paperwork and time wasted for taxpayers. A higher standard deduction results in a smarter, simpler way to deliver tax savings that doesn’t pick winners and losers. Important deductions that hard working families rely on like the mortgage interest deduction, charitable contribution deduction, and credits for childcare and education will be strengthened by a fairer and clearer tax code. For example, there are currently 15 various provisions in the tax code covering higher education, instead of one clear and simple credit that will help families afford their most important investment. Reforming confusing deductions and closing loopholes will translate into lower tax rates for all Americans.   Navigating the confusing tax code is a drain on the growth, investment, and job creation opportunities that business owners want to inject into our local economy. In theory, the current code rewards a business owner when he or she invests in new equipment, facilities, or research and development, allowing them to write-off those expenses over time through depreciation. The system of depreciation schedules, however, is a confusing mess. Our economy can advance further by doing away with depreciation schedules altogether and replacing it with a zero tax rate on all new business investment. This presents a historic opportunity for job creation and growth for American businesses and the American economy.  We also need to make our tax code more competitive globally. The United States is the world’s leading economy, and yet we have the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world at 35%. Furthermore, our tax code currently pushes jobs overseas, hurting our businesses and driving out good paying private sector jobs. We must reform the code to allow our manufacturers to compete abroad and create more “Made in America” products. Our broken tax code incentivizes the import of cheap foreign products but doesn’t do enough to help our manufacturers or farmers export their products. The solution is simple: we have to lower the corporate rate to make America competitive on the global market again. Also, when our code is reformed to be globally competitive, we’ll see billions in assets that are currently “stranded” overseas come home to create jobs and help grow the economy. We may also be able to use some of those repatriated funds to repair our nation’s infrastructure as well. The tax code should be globally competitive and pro-growth, first and foremost. We must have a tax code that rewards hard work, investment, and innovation.  Reforming the tax code so it works in favor of, not in opposition to, the American worker is one of my top priorities for the new term in Congress. While there is much work ahead to make necessary improvements, I am optimistic of what we can accomplish in the coming months and years. We must always put the needs of our nation first, and I will continue to pursue solutions which simplify our tax code and strengthen our economy.","status",NA,NA,89,70,14,3,0,1,1,7

However, I cannot ignore the rise in specific and very serious allegations that have been made to my office in recent years. As Chairman Roe mentioned in his letter to the Northport VA, the deteriorating facilities are very concerning and alarming.

My office has made repeated attempts to engage Northport in moving their priorities up on the Department’s list, but the projects Northport VA have identified barely address the overall construction and maintenance issues that currently exist, and the fact remains that several of the ongoing requests have seen little to no progress from the Department. Northport VA has been critically important to meet the healthcare needs of many in our veteran community. Significant action must be taken to ensure Northport VA is only providing the highest quality of care for Long Island veterans. I thank the Chairman and the committee for their continued work to improve veterans’ care at Northport VA and VA facilities across the country.”  Last year, after the media first reported that the Northport VA closed operating rooms due to a faulty HVAC system, Congressman Zeldin was contacted by several Long Islanders, including veterans, whistleblowers and other stakeholders, regarding very specific and serious allegations that have been made with regard to the Northport VA.

On the night of April 6, 2017, the Syrian government used chemical weapons in a barbaric attack against its own people, resulting in the murder of dozens of Syrian men, women, and children. A violation of international law and a grievous crime against humanity, we as a nation cannot stand idly by witnessing such horrific acts of cruelty against civilians who want nothing but a peaceful life. These chemical weapons should have already been destroyed, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must be held responsible and accountable.   I strongly applaud the decision of the Trump Administration to launch a missile strike in response to these horrible crimes. This strike, which targeted infrastructure and not people, sends a forceful message that the United States has no tolerance for such actions. In the past, complacency and inaction have proven to be very costly, and we must be smarter and more effective with our efforts. An essential aspect of this is broadening our coalition of support; only then can we turn the tide in a country that is sadly in complete chaos, culminating in inhumane chemical warfare against innocent lives. The Syrian people deserve a new chapter which promises to change direction in favor of stability and peace.   Assad’s use of chemical weapons against his own people was a cowardly and shameful tactic which only reinforces the reality that the Syrian people will never know peace unless something is done to eliminate this threat. President Trump’s decision to launch this missile strike was a demonstration to foreign governments that sponsoring horrific acts of terror, such as the April 6th chemical attack in Syria, comes with consequences.   However, we must be smart about the kind of military strategy we employ. We are blessed to have the finest men and women in uniform serving the most amazing and talented military this world has ever seen. As such, when they are sent into harm’s way, they must be sent with a clear strategy to win or not be sent at all. I am not currently aware of any request for additional troops in Syria; however, if this is the direction the administration chooses to take, it is so important that any request receive careful examination which takes all factors into consideration to ensure it is the wisest possible option. There is a big difference between a request for a small amount of our best of the best of the best, such as our Navy Seals, Delta Force, Green Berets, Army Rangers, or Marines, to carry out an important mission that requires a very limited amount of personnel for a high value target, whether it’s individuals, equipment, or intelligence. On the other hand, sending tens of thousands of American troops in to occupy Syrian territory would definitely not be the right answer.  I have long believed that protecting America’s security at home and abroad and keeping our nation safe from any threat must always be our first priority. A destabilized Syria has directly contributed to the rise of ISIS and other regional and global threats; helping secure stability for their nation is an integral part of establishing peace for ours. We must pursue a stronger, more consistent foreign policy which strengthens our relationships with our allies and treats our adversaries as our adversaries. Eradicating the threat of terror wherever it may arise around the world is essential in securing the United States and rest of the free world. We must always do all in our power to keep our people safe, secure, and free.","status",NA,NA,93,64,9,5,0,0,1,9

The issue of illicit financing and money laundering is hitting home in the most personal and tragic way in Suffolk County where we’ve seen ongoing violence perpetrated by these gangs taking innocent lives and threatening the safety of our schools. Money laundering is a key tool for these violent criminal organizations that are tearing apart peaceful communities on Long Island and nationwide. It allows them to hide their drug trafficking revenue and transfer it illicitly across the border. It is how they buy weapons and fuels the growth of their dangerous criminal enterprises. Earlier this month, we saw the senseless and tragic murders of four young men, which only further cemented our need to solve the gang violence crisis on Long Island and nationwide. Two of the victims of these murders perpetrated by MS-13, Justin Llivicura and Jorge Tigre, were residents of New York’s First Congressional District. Now more than ever, we need coordination on all fronts so that our local law enforcement on the front lines can best respond to this grave threat, working with other state and federal agencies.

After this vote, the Congressman released the following statement:  “Over the past several years, I have heard from many constituents who have shared their thoughts and ideas on how to improve healthcare in America. Their perspectives span across the ideological spectrum and vary greatly. I sincerely appreciate each and every person who has taken the time to express their opinions on this very important topic.    Almost everyone agrees that our current system is deeply flawed. For example, just yesterday, Iowa’s last major insurer through the ACA, Medica, threatened to remove itself unless something is done to stabilize the markets. Imagine no option at all for an entire state? None! There are too many other examples of how this law is deeply flawed. We all agree healthcare must be improved and that doing nothing is not an option. We are the greatest country in the world and we can and must do better for all citizens.  One of my top priorities in Congress has been to improve healthcare in America. I have always supported the repeal and replace of Obamacare and a smooth transition to a better reality that will improve affordability, access, quality of care and options, while continuing to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parent's policy.   The American Health Care Act provides relief from billions of dollars of crushing taxes and mandates enacted under the ACA. Additionally, the bill repeals the individual and employer mandates, taxes on prescription and over the counter medications, health insurance premiums and medical devices.  This bill would help Americans access healthcare in ways they previously could not, by increasing competition in the marketplace and offering plans that will be tailored to individual needs. The bill provides flexible options for coverage, such as increased access to health savings accounts, which would allow individuals to set aside pre-tax dollars to help cover health care costs. The bill also creates a Patient and State Stability Fund, endowed with billions of dollars, to increase access to necessary services and to help keep costs down. I am also strongly supportive of the Collins-Faso Amendment, also known as the Property Tax Reduction Act, the single greatest act of fiscal relief ever provided to the County of Suffolk and its taxpayers. Shifting the local share of Medicaid costs to the state, this amendment was included in the legislation that passed the House today. There are also many other very positive aspects of this bill.   There are so many outright lies attacking this legislation, like the social media campaign absurdly claiming that 310,000 NY-1 residents with pre-existing conditions would lose their health care under the AHCA. That's not within a million degrees of accurate.  The amount of outright lies about the AHCA that have been manufactured and echoed by individuals and entities have been insane. The bill protects people with pre-existing conditions, and gives states greater flexibility to lower premiums and stabilize the insurance market. The lies about this bill are being perpetuated by the same people who told us if you liked your plan, you could keep your plan, if you liked your doctor, you could keep your doctor, and that premiums under the ACA would decrease by $2,500 per family.   Passage of this bill is an important step in a multi pronged effort to improve health care in our country.   There is still much more work ahead to improve healthcare for all Americans in addition to the passage of this bill. The next steps of this process include administrative action to further ensure a smooth transition, as well as additional legislative action, which started with the passage of the Small Business Health Fairness Act (H.R. 1101) and the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act (H.R. 372), to allow the pooling of policies across state lines and reform current law to increase competition in the health insurance market. There are also other necessary reforms to healthcare that can’t be accomplished through the budget reconciliation process that still should get done: lowering drug costs for patients, providing additional flexibility in Medicaid for states to manage their own programs as effectively as possible, and medical legal reforms.   A smooth transition during this period is critical. I will continue to follow all developments on this process closely over the coming months.”","status",NA,NA,321,1067,98,27,2,0,12,541

Obamacare has resulted in higher premiums, higher deductibles, lost doctors, and cancelled policies, among many other challenges. Deductibles are so high, many people now feel like they don’t even have insurance anymore. One-third of the counties in our country only have one option left under the exchange. That’s not choice. That’s a monopoly. Almost everyone agrees that our current system is deeply flawed and that healthcare must be improved. Doing nothing is not an option.   Under the American Health Care Act, the individual and employer mandates are being removed, Obamacare’s taxes are almost entirely eliminated (over $800 billion in tax relief), and there will be more choices, competition and affordability than under current law, while continuing to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parent’s policy as they can under current law. This is one important step of a three step process to ensure a smooth transition to a better reality for health care in our country.  There is so much misinformation being circulated on this bill, especially on social media. Here are some specific facts to set the record straight regarding untruthful claims being made over social media and elsewhere:  Is it true that under the current plan Members of Congress will be exempt? No. At the same exact time the American Health Care Act was passed in the House of Representatives, the House also passed legislation (H.R. 2192) to make it crystal clear that Members of Congress would not receive any special treatment whatsoever.   Is it true that Members of Congress receive special health care insurance coverage not currently available to the general public? No.   Is it true that the American Health Care Act changes the definition of pre-existing conditions? No.   Is it true that under the American Health Care Act, 310,000 NY-1 residents with pre-existing conditions will lose their health insurance? Not within a million degrees of accurate in any way, shape or form.   Is it true that in New York insurers will be able to charge people more if they have a pre-existing condition? No. New Yorkers with pre-existing conditions cannot be denied health insurance coverage for their pre-existing condition and cannot be charged more for their pre-existing condition.   But what if New York asks for a waiver? New York is not asking for a waiver, but even if it did, New Yorkers still cannot be denied health insurance coverage for their pre-existing condition and as long as they maintain continuous coverage without a lapse for more than 63 days then they cannot be charged more either. Even if there is a lapse for more than 63 days, states remain required to protect people with pre-existing conditions to ensure they have access to affordable policies, which comes with financial help from the federal government. It is hysteria to claim that people with pre-existing conditions are not protected even if the protection is a little different than in non-waiver states.  Is it true that there was no Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score for the American Health Care Act? No. The CBO has already weighed in on almost this entire bill.  Is it true that no one actually read the bill? No. Speaking for myself, I sure did. It's only 138 pages long. Three amendments were added last week, and I read those myself before the vote.","status",NA,NA,189,317,123,15,4,0,3,68

Sarsour is a highly controversial individual to invite for this commencement address due to her extensive history of anti-American, anti-Israel, pro-Sharia Law, and pro-terrorist rhetoric and relationships. She has stated that the United States was built upon the values of “genocide”, and has advocated for Sharia Law and calls for violence against those with whom she disagrees. From her association with known terrorists to her hateful rhetoric like calling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ‘a waste of a human being’ and promoting Sharia Law, this invite was in extremely poor taste and must be rescinded.

However, as a natural reality of our enjoyment of these treasures, we also have to contend with tick-borne illness, incidents of which skyrocket during the summer months. The most common tickborne infection in the United States is Lyme Disease, which affects tens of thousands of Americans every year. Here in New York, in 2015, we had the third highest rate of Lyme Disease contraction. As someone who has personally contracted this disease, I can tell you that it is a very serious matter which requires our attention. We must do more to advance prevention and recovery efforts for Lyme Disease, which can be fatal if left untreated.  May is Lyme Disease Awareness Month, and as members of a community which has an above average rate of contraction, we must each do our part to educate and minimize incidents of occurrence. Early indicators of Lyme Disease include flu-like symptoms, such as fever, muscle aches, and fatigue, as well as rashes, which often times may look like a bullseye. The key to prevention is tick check and removal, especially if you are out enjoying the summer in fields or tall grass. Should you or a member of your family suspect that you may have contracted the disease, it is so important that medical assistance is sought out as soon as possible.   I have been honored to be part of the effort to combat Lyme Disease as your Representative. In the last Congress, I cosponsored and helped pass the 21st Century Cures Act (H.R. 34). This new law accelerates the process for scientific advancement, gives researchers access to necessary resources, and helps deliver lifesaving or life improving cures and treatments to Americans suffering from a disease. This critical piece of legislation provides $4.8 billion in new funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which conducts essential medical and public health research on illnesses such as Lyme. I was also a cosponsor of the Tick-Borne Disease Research and Accountability and Transparency Act (H.R. 789), which passed as part of H.R. 34, to further advance research on Lyme and other tick-borne illnesses.  In addition, the recently enacted budget provides a $2 billion dollar increase for NIH, including the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which focuses its efforts on diseases like Lyme. This funding will allow researchers to continue their work in finding new cures and treatments for the most prevalent diseases affecting Americans. The budget also increases funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by $22 million. CDC conducts annual research on the effects of this disease, as well as preventative measures.  Long Island is home to one of the most beautiful and unique environments throughout the entire nation, and with this distinction comes the responsibility of ensuring our residents remain protected. This month, we must stay vigilant and prepare ourselves to deal with the spread of Lyme Disease. While I will continue my work in Congress to ensure research for this disease remains funded at the appropriate levels, we must all join together as a community to overcome this challenge.","status",NA,NA,90,70,12,3,2,0,0,0

I have always supported the immediate opening of this county operated beach.     The long term solution that has been available and remains available to ensure this never happens again now or in the future is for Suffolk County to work with the federal Fish and Wildlife Service to formulate a new conservation plan for these birds that is both flexible and sensible. Over and over again, I have communicated this in person and in writing to the county. There is a light, but the county either refuses to see it or refuses to head towards it and what's worse is that they have absolutely no problem collecting fees from people for beach access that isn't granted. The answer is simple, known and clear as day...Suffolk County and Fish and Wildlife work together to formulate a new conservation plan that would keep the beach open for off road vehicles. The next step has been and remains for the county to make this request. I can't possibly tee this up any better for the county, including directly speaking with the Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, and the county really needs to stop playing games here. If I sound frustrated with the nonsensical and unhelpful finger pointing others are engaging in it is because it is frustrating.

The 2008 housing crash wreaked havoc on our nation and hurt millions of people from all corners of our nation. Government encouraged lenders to offer mortgages beyond the buyer's means. These mortgages were inappropriately given AAA ratings. Financial institutions purchased and held too many of these loans that were not rated correctly. When homeowners started defaulting, the whole system blew up. Enter Dodd-Frank, which has resulted in big banks getting bigger, and small banks becoming fewer, all while perpetuating ""Too Big to Fail"". As a result of Dodd-Frank, community banks and credit unions have had to lay off employees, sell to a large firm, or just disappear altogether because they cannot afford the compliance costs. This is why JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon calls Dodd-Frank a ""moat"" between his large bank and the competition. At a time when some reports show that the U.S. economy is losing one community financial institution per day, reform is needed now more than ever before.   I am proud to have supported and helped pass the CHOICE Act, critical legislation which is so important to grow our economy, roll back many of the harmful regulations seen in Dodd-Frank, and strengthen our community banks and credit unions. This legislation will also impose the toughest penalties for financial fraud and deception ever seen before, holding the big banks accountable and putting an end to ""Too Big to Fail"". In addition, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently reported that CHOICE will reduce the deficit by $24 billion over 10 years. CHOICE will also revamp the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to serve as an enforcement agency, working to enforce the laws already on the books and help the average American. Consumer protection is immensely important; however, CFPB’s undue influence has actively harmed the very people it purports to help.   Dodd-Frank showed us that big government regulation and a one size fits all approach to the financial sector do not work for our community banks and credit unions, and it has done nothing but increase costs for both businesses and consumers. Passing CHOICE is a crucial next step to grow the American economy and unleash its full potential, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to see this bill become law.","link","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCldfphVjY","youtube.com",92,154,19,10,1,1,1,39

The bill is expected to be marked up in committee as early as this week. NY-1 is almost completely surrounded by water, which is why, as we saw during Super Storm Sandy, so many homeowners rely upon the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to protect their property. However, NFIP is in dire need of reform to address the program’s debt of $24.6 billion, protect homeowners’ access to affordable insurance, and improve the way claims are processed so that policyholders aren’t stuck dealing with bureaucracy and red tape after their property is damaged by a flood. That is why, as part of the overall effort to reauthorize and reform NFIP, I have introduced the NFIP Policyholder Protection Act. Making insurance more affordable and providing more access to NFIP policies are key. We also must shift the focus toward mitigation so that there is an incentive for homeowners and communities to take proactive steps to protect against flood damage. A recurring concern that I hear across the district is that homeowners who have done the right thing and elevated or renovated their homes have not seen a corresponding drop in flood insurance premiums. Taxpayers save $3 for every $1 that is spent on mitigation, which is a key reason why preparedness must be a critical focus to protect life and property. Also worth noting, NFIP also has a government monopoly that crowds out private insurers and makes it difficult for them to write and sell these supplemental plans so essential on Long Island. Passage of this bill is critical to protect homeowners on Long Island and across the country. I look forward to getting this bill across the finish line.

So many VA employees genuinely care about the work they do and want to help veterans, but we must always ensure that any poor performing VA employee who is not acting in the best interest of veterans is held accountable. The legislation also further protects whistleblowers, ensuring those who come forward about wrongdoings will be protected.

The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which so many homeowners rely on, currently has a debt of $24.6 billion and must be reformed so that the program will continue to provide homeowners with access to affordable insurance. In NY-1, which is almost completely surrounded by water, we saw firsthand during Super Storm Sandy just how many homeowners rely upon NFIP to protect their property. I’ve heard time and again from homeowners in my district who are frustrated with the process. More can and must be done to protect homeowners’ access to affordable insurance, and improve the way claims are processed so that policyholders aren’t stuck dealing with bureaucracy and red tape after their property is damaged by a flood. We also must shift the focus toward mitigation so that there is an incentive for homeowners and communities to take proactive steps to protect against flood damage.

Too many lives have been cut short; too many families ripped apart. No parent should ever have to bury their child for any reason, especially because they were suffering from a drug addiction and could not get the help they desperately needed. This problem is not going away unless something bold and massive is done that squashes this plague at the root of its source.  Our communities and families on Long Island have been especially impacted by the rise of prescription drug abuse and the growing heroin epidemic. As such, it is so important that we ensure every available resource is utilized to eradicate drug abuse from our neighborhoods. A key aspect of achieving this objective involves collaborative efforts with local elected officials, law enforcement, health professionals, community groups, parents, concerned residents and those in recovery, to discuss and develop localized community based solutions to tackle this crisis, by increasing treatment, recovery services, and education.  To further support our communities as they take on this challenge, I was proud to have cosponsored and helped pass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (S. 524), or CARA, in the last Congress. This critical legislation provides a total of $8.3 billion in funding over five years to help combat the heroin and opioid abuse epidemic, and funds many initiatives on the local level. This includes $103 million over the five year authorization of the bill to establish a community-based competitive grant program to address and treat the challenges associated with heroin and opioid addiction and abuse, $160 million in funding over the authorization period for newly created treatment programs, the expansion of existing medically assisted treatments, and specialized treatment programs for pregnant women, veterans, and children through community based initiatives, and so much more.  Improving access and affordability of healthcare in America is another critical aspect of this fight. Addiction is a disease, and it should be treated as such. Unless we systematically and proactively restructure our existing options in healthcare positively, many Americans suffering from drug addiction will never recover. This includes ensuring access to insurance policies which cover long term treatment for those who desperately need it. Too often, those suffering from drug addiction are unable to receive the continuous coverage required for true recovery, and tragically lose their lives as a result.  I have also made it a priority to ensure that our communities are provided with higher supplies of Naloxone, or Narcan, a life saving medication that is safe and easy to administer, and has been proven to reverse an overdose within minutes. In addition to a provision of CARA which gives additional funding for a greater community supply of Narcan, I was a strong cosponsor of the Stop Overdose Stat (SOS) Act (H.R. 2850) in the 114th Congress which would provide an additional $25 million over a 5 year period for production and distribution to make sure that medical professionals and families have it in their possession, and are trained and ready to administer it. However, we must be sure that those who are saved by Narcan do not just return right away to using again and are immediately provided with the help needed to fully recover.  Through the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 244), bipartisan legislation which recently passed the House, $3.6 billion will be provided to aid in the implementation of CARA. The bill funds the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA) at $130.5 million above the previous Administration’s budget request to aid in these efforts, while maintaining robust funding for the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant at $1.8 billion. In addition, $500 million in funding will be authorized through the 21st Century Cures Act (H.R. 34); bipartisan legislation which was passed and signed into law at the end of the last Congress. This provides a total increase of $650 million for initiatives to address the opioid crisis. I also announced last week that, through H.R. 244, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has made available over $70 million in community based grants to combat this threat, which includes $28 million in funding for medication-assisted treatment (MAT) to help treat those suffering.  In addition to providing vital funding for treatment and education efforts, it is imperative that we take the necessary steps to secure our borders against those who bring in illicit substances which have wrecked havoc within our communities. It is good news that H.R. 244 also includes $1.5 billion in increased funding for border security to strengthen infrastructure and technology, and improve Border Patrol hiring initiatives. As part of a legislative package to combat drug abuse, several bills to cut the flow of drugs coming into our nation have passed the House. This includes H.R. 3380, a bill to help law enforcement officials identify and target drug traffickers, as well as the Kingpin Designation Improvement Act of 2016 (H.R. 4985) to further combat narcotics trafficking, by allowing for easier prosecution of these criminals.  Addiction is a devastating disease that takes lives, tears families apart, and destroys our communities. The heroin and opioid abuse crisis has severely impacted our local community and has become a major issue across the country. It must be stopped. This is an effort that must be addressed at all levels of government. In Congress, I’ll continue working to advance legislation that helps those coping with drug addiction, by increasing treatment and recovery services to stop the tragic loss of life, family, and community as a result of addiction. This problem is far too serious to ignore, fail and not confront head on boldly and massively. I’ve personally been to too many wakes and funerals for young men and women who have lost their lives way too early and sadly. There remains so many lives that can still be saved.","status",NA,NA,77,57,9,6,0,0,4,0

Millions of Americans were negatively impacted, many right within our home state, with so many people losing their jobs, having their homes foreclosed upon, and ultimately left in a state of dire financial uncertainty. The “Great Recession” was caused by weak underwriting standards, flawed big government policies, and the trading and long term holding of poorly rated home loans, which would never be paid back. In 2008 alone, 861,664 families lost their homes.    The crisis only worsened in the following years, and left our nation with an economic gap which we are still recovering from. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, commonly referred to as “Dodd-Frank,” was signed into law in 2010. It was clear that a better direction was needed for our economy to recover; however, Dodd-Frank has had so many disastrous and negative consequences that contradict the originally stated purpose of the legislation.   As a result of Dodd-Frank, new onerous rules like the qualified mortgage rule have contributed to young families raising their children in their parent’s basement, because they can’t afford the down payment on a home, or get a mortgage from a local bank. Our community banks and credit unions, which have been serving local businesses and families for generations, cannot afford the compliance costs imposed on them by Dodd-Frank. They have to lay-off employees or worse sell to larger firm because the “compliance tax” has squeezed them so severely. Meanwhile the big banks are able to front the costs of these regulations and all the necessary attorneys and lobbyists with ease. The problem is becoming so bad that some reports even show that the U.S. economy is losing one community bank or credit union per day and the loss of market share for community banks has doubled. Big banks are getting bigger, and small banks are becoming fewer.   Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a highly unconstitutional and unaccountable fourth branch of government exercising immense power over the financial sector that has harmed too many of the middle income Americans it was supposedly created to help. As a result of this agency’s undue influence, auto loans have become far more expensive and bank fees have increased for so many Americans. To make matters worse, small businesses have found that their sources of credit have been dramatically reduced, cutting their access to capital and limiting their potential for growth and job creation.   The House just passed the Creating Hope and Opportunity for Investors, Consumers, and Entrepreneurs Act, otherwise known as the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 (H.R. 10). This critical legislation addresses an extensive amount of the harmful aspects of Dodd-Frank by imposing stricter accountability, increasing access to credit and capital for small businesses and individuals, and so much more.   Bad financial industry actors know that taxpayers will eventually bail them out, because Dodd-Frank perpetuates “Too Big To Fail”. The average American should never have to shoulder the burden when these financial institutions go belly up, and CHOICE will ensure these institutions remain accountable for their actions. There is something to be said about the fact that the CHOICE Act is garnering enormous support from community banks and credit unions, while drawing high profile detractors from Wall Street. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein has publically stated that he will profit under Dodd-Frank, and now, many of the big banks and financial institutions have come out in strong opposition to CHOICE. JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has even referred to the badly designed regulations following the 2008 crisis as a “bigger moat” which protects his bank from the competition. Dodd-Frank allows these big banks to claim a larger market over the financial industry at the expense of the American consumer and our community institutions, whereas CHOICE will put the power back into the hands of the little guy.  Economic liberty, transparency and choice are the cornerstones of a thriving economy. Many of the alleged “protections” implemented under Dodd-Frank have done nothing but increase costs for both businesses and consumers, while limiting choice by imposing a layer of costly regulations negatively impacting available financial products. Now that the CHOICE Act has passed through the House, it is imperative that it passes the Senate so that we get it on the President’s desk to be signed into law. We must learn and never forget the lessons of the 2008 housing crash as well as the reality of Dodd-Frank’s negative impacts on small business and consumers. The sooner CHOICE becomes law, the sooner we can unleash the full potential of the American economy.","status",NA,NA,50,63,11,2,5,0,1,13

A key part of this reform legislation is to hold poor performing employees accountable by providing VA administration with necessary resources and flexibility. I believe that nearly all VA employees genuinely care about the work they do and want to help veterans, but we must always ensure that the 1% who are not acting in the best interest of veterans are held accountable. Also included in this law is much needed protection for whistleblowers, which will ensure that those who come forward about wrongdoings will be protected. Reforming the VA to improve the quality of care for our nation’s heroes is necessary. This new law is an important step forward to best care for our veterans.   https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-zeldin-va-reform-legislation-signed-law","link","https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-zeldin-va-reform-legislation-signed-law","zeldin.house.gov",121,44,16,8,0,0,0,0

Further action is still required to align complex manual wheelchair pricing with complex power equipment pricing.

Zeldin Announces $104,762 FEMA Grant to Jamesport Fire Department   Congressman Lee Zeldin (R, NY-1) announced today that the Jamesport Fire Department has been awarded $104,762 through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program. Funding from this grant will be used to purchase critical communications equipment, including vehicle radios and mobile data terminals.   Congressman Zeldin said, “I am proud to announce that this essential funding has been awarded to the Jamesport Fire Department. This grant will be used to purchase much needed communications supplies. It is absolutely essential that our firefighters are able to utilize the best possible equipment; these brave men and women put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities, and they should have access to every resource available. I would like to thank FEMA for their assistance in carrying out this important mission.”   “The Jamesport Fire District is pleased to be awarded a Firefighter Grant from FEMA. This very much needed funding will assist the district in updating our antiquated communication system that is now in service.

Opening fire on a nearly defenseless group participating in our nation’s pastime on a baseball diamond, unwavering heroism from Capitol Police saved everyone’s life except for the shooter. Five people, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, were badly and unnecessarily injured in this shameful act of violence. It is ok to disagree in our country. That freedom is one of the reasons we are able to live in the greatest nation in the world, but there is a way to disagree, and this cowardly act certainly should never be tolerated or acceptable. I believe strongly that everyone in our nation, spanning the ideological spectrum, can recommit ourselves today to being more unified as Americans first above all else.  Congress, like our nation at large, is composed of individuals of many very diverse backgrounds and perspectives on the many challenges facing our country. From the bluest, most liberal leaning districts in America, to the reddest, most conservative leaning districts, our diversity of thought and passion is absolutely something to be embraced. As citizens of the United States, we are also all blessed with the ability to openly discuss and debate conflicting viewpoints with the intention of better understanding each other and the many ideas on potential solutions. Differences are acceptable and debate is healthy, but the norm must include a vigorous pursuit of common ground wherever possible. The founding bedrock of our democracy is the guarantee that not only are diverse voices heard, but are productively, substantively debated amongst our nation’s citizens and leaders alike with the goal of bettering our shared nation. The events that culminated on the morning of June 14 stand in stark contrast to these principles.   In the wake of this senseless act of violence, we must stand together as Americans united in our intolerance of intolerance itself. We will never allow ourselves to be intimidated by those who use violence to spread their hateful message. June 14, 2017 should serve as a reminder of what happens when we allow hatred to divide us to the extreme. Throughout our nation’s long and storied history, Americans from all walks of life have consistently joined together to reject injustice wherever it may exist. It is this strength which unifies us as citizens of the greatest country on Earth. We must always hold bipartisanship, unity, and our bond as Americans in the highest regard.  I would like to pass along our prayers and best wishes to all of the victims of the Alexandria shooting: House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, Zack Barth, Matt Mika, and a very special thank you to Capitol Police Officers Crystal Griner and David Bailey. I’ve spent time with Steve’s security detail through the years and I can personally vouch for their extraordinary talent and professionalism. All Americans have a perennial obligation to provide our police officers with every ounce of support we have to offer. We are all universally reliant on the ceaseless protection offered by law enforcement, and our support for these brave men and women should never be a partisan issue.  Being present at the Congressional Baseball Game and Softball Game for charity was a truly breathtaking experience. The sheer amount of American pride reverberating throughout the crowds could be felt by everyone there, Republican, Democrat, or Independent. This outpouring of support from all corners proves that bipartisanship is not and can not be dead. However, it should never take a horrible tragedy to remind us just how important these virtues are. There are so many challenges that exist, but we must start by reaching across the aisle to find common ground and move our country forward. Like many of my colleagues in Congress, I am willing to work with absolutely anyone to better our community, state and nation.  At the end of the day, we are all Americans, and during this time of polarization and political strife, coming together as one nation, one people, is more important than ever before. Not one of the obstacles we face as Americans is insurmountable; however, one party alone cannot overcome every last challenge that exists. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues from across the political spectrum as we strive for a better America.","status",NA,NA,111,98,14,12,1,0,7,1

One of New York’s four signers became the first representative of New York’s First Congressional District, William Floyd. Not content to allow the burden of oppression to prevail, our Founding Fathers ignited a revolution the likes of which the world had never seen and has yet to be matched to this day. In doing so, they formulated a system of governance which provided its citizens with a revolutionary concept: freedom.    On Independence Day, we celebrate the essential virtues of personal liberty, self-reliance, and equality of opportunity. We cherish our freedoms and believe that it is this sustained liberty and leadership in America which makes us so exceptional. Personal autonomy is the lifeblood of our people; a value that without, we lose our identity.    Our Founding Fathers pioneered the concept of autonomous government of the people, by the people, and for the people. On this day so many years ago, the Declaration of Independence was signed by men who saw a better future for the great people of this nation, one where they could design their own destiny without intrusion from a central power.    As these legendary visionaries wrote, “... all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” The words written on that sacred document ring true to this very day.    Preservation of this liberty is paramount, and generations of Americans have fought to uphold the ideals our nation was created upon. The sacrifices of our military veterans, many of whom paid the ultimate price in defense of our great country and the liberties we hold dear, must never be forgotten. We are forever grateful for the heroic actions of all who have served and continue to serve today to protect us and our families. Our nation’s path to greatness is forever paved with the deeds of these heroes, and to that, we owe a debt which can never fully be repaid.   Between the barbeques and fireworks, on Independence Day, we come together to celebrate our great, most exceptional nation.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepLeeZeldin/photos/a.387918101376980.1073741828.386192271549563/794121850756601/?type=3",NA,269,71,40,35,1,0,0,4

The Bytyqi brothers were senselessly and brutally murdered in 1999, 18 years ago, and my resolution calls for justice.    The Bytyqi brothers left the comfort and safety of their homes in the United States to help stop horrific crimes against humanity abroad. After their service in uniform was over, these three brothers chose to embark on a civilian humanitarian mission, where they were arrested after accidentally crossing into Serbian-controlled territory. Two weeks later, they were given a judicial order of release. Instead, the brutal execution of these men followed shortly after, and it was not until 2001, two years later, that their remains were found in a mass grave. While Serbian authorities have investigated the deaths of the brothers, there have been no charges brought against those responsible for these murders. Moreover, the main suspect remains a prominent member of the governing political party.   Since taking office, I have been committed to helping the Bytyqi family receive the justice they have long deserved, and have been in contact with them as we work to resolve this situation. It is absolutely reprehensible that, despite many promises by Serbian officials to resolve the case, no individual has ever been found guilty of this horrible crime, nor of any other crimes associated with the deaths of these innocent Americans. It is the responsibility of the Serbian government to resolve this case, and my resolution notes that progress into this investigation should remain a significant factor which determines the further development of U.S.-Serbian relations. Their inaction on finding and prosecuting those responsible is an insult not only to the memory of the Bytyqi brothers and their family, but to every American. The Bytyqi brothers gave their lives to fight injustice; it is now upon us to return this favor and deliver justice for their family.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBCwtTzFS00&feature=youtu.be","video","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBCwtTzFS00&feature=youtu.be",NA,69,67,9,4,0,2,8,0

As part of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (Public Law 114–17), which was passed and signed into law by the President, in order for the deal to be continued, every 90 days, the current administration must recertify that Iran is fully implementing the agreement, and that the suspension of sanctions is both proportionate to the measures taken by Iran to end its illicit nuclear weapons program and vital to protect U.S. national security. The certification is due to Congress today.   Not only is the Iran nuclear agreement not vital to protecting U.S. national security, it actually harms U.S. national security, which has only been further proven by Iranian aggression in the Middle East region since this terribly flawed deal was entered into two years ago. This ‘deal’ negotiated away our leverage without any resolution on Iran’s other bad activities, such as overthrowing foreign governments, sponsoring terrorism, developing InterContinental Ballistic Missiles, blowing up mock U.S. warships, pledging to wipe Israel off the map, and chanting Death to America in their streets on their holidays, all while unjustly imprisoning American citizens. I pressed President Obama to walk away from this unsigned, bad deal giving the Iranians up to $150 billion in sanctions relief, and now, in 2017, I am urging President Trump to stand for our nation’s best interests and not recertify the agreement. Even if Iran doesn’t cheat on the agreement, the JCPOA serves as a pathway and blueprint for the Iranians to obtain a nuclear weapon in just over a decade. It truly is absurd that we would have ever agreed to this arrangement in the first place. A better deal or no deal would have been much alternatives. There is too much at stake to allow the JCPOA to continue.   https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-zeldin-statement-calling-administration-not-recertify-iran-deal","link","https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-zeldin-statement-calling-administration-not-recertify-iran-deal","zeldin.house.gov",151,81,13,8,0,2,3,22

This legislation, which passed the House in the last Congress, would establish international border security standards to close security gaps that currently exist that allow terrorists and foreign fighters to travel internationally. The plan would establish international border security standards that would be developed in coordination with all the relevant U.S. Governmental departments and agencies in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, Director of National Intelligence, and Director of the FBI. Under the plan, U.S. resources would be utilized in the most efficient way possible with a special focus on high-risk and medium-risk countries to boost security. Under this legislation, a reporting system would also be established to monitor efforts of foreign governments to combat terrorism and foreign fighter travel and to suspend foreign assistance to countries not making significant efforts to comply. Furthermore, the bill would put in place a monitoring system that would screen for infectious diseases to contain and prevent any potential outbreaks, which will help quarantine viruses, by authorizing the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide the necessary equipment and supplies to mitigate the risk or threat of infectious diseases, such as Zika.

Fishing is a treasured part of our identities as Long Islanders. Yet today, the current flaws in the management of our fisheries aren't just raising costs for commercial fishermen and charter boat captains- it also hurts all the small businesses in the coastal economy, including restaurants, bait & tackle shops, hotels, and gas stations. Quite candidly, it is also making this pastime just nowhere near as much fun as it used to be either. As the Representative for New York’s First Congressional District, which is almost entirely surrounded by water, I am committed to supporting our fishermen and ensuring this tradition is preserved for generations to come.  The current management of our fisheries has created a web of unnecessary restrictions on our local anglers. For example, just last week, regulators gave final approval to a confusing set of requirements that call for a one inch difference in the size limit for fluke, 18 inches for New Jersey anglers, but 19 inches for New York. There is also a proposed regulation that would create two separate sets of rules for blackfish, one for the North Shore, and one for the South Shore. Current rules in our state also limit anglers to only one striped bass and weakfish per day. A rule like this is very damaging to the fishing industry. Many people just aren’t going to spend all the money it costs to go out on a charter boat if they can only catch and keep one fish. Using flawed, outdated data to justify that bad rule makes even less sense. New York representatives on regional councils have to do much more to fight for our fishermen because we continue to get rolled at the table by other coastal states that take a much more proactive role within these councils, getting better quotas for their states while New York anglers do not get their fair share. Additionally, these decisions on fishing regulations are being made using old, obsolete data, which has not been updated in years. There is no reason that our fishermen should be held back by numbers and figures that may have had relevance in years prior, but simply do not apply in 2017.  I have long worked hard to get various victories across the finish line for our fishermen. In 2011, for example, as a member of the New York State Senate, I led the successful effort to repeal the Saltwater Fishing License Fee. My efforts have continued in Congress. In February, I reintroduced my legislation from the 114th Congress, the Local Fishing Access Act (H.R. 1195). This bill will provide Long Island anglers with relief from confusing and burdensome regulations, by reforming the federal law that bans striped bass fishing in the Block Island transit zone, which are federal waters between Montauk, New York, and Block Island, Rhode Island. Striped bass fishing has been banned in these waters since 1990, and yet commercial and recreational fishing is allowed for dozens of other species. Passage of this legislation will allow Long Island’s fishermen to once again enjoy striped bass fishing off the coast of Montauk, both commercially and recreationally, and to make sure that a nice day on the water doesn’t suddenly turn into a federal crime when a vessel drifts from state to federal waters.  In addition, H.R. 244, legislation which was recently passed by Congress and signed by the President, includes $72.5 million for the National Sea Grant College Program. This important program works with local oyster growers, fishermen, watermen, and other businesses in the coastal economy to grow and sustain their business models, connecting them to local resources to share best practices, and helping them navigate a complex patchwork of state and federal coastal zone management regulations through technical assistance. Alongside Congressman Joe Courtney (CT-02), I also led a bipartisan group of 95 members of the House in sending a letter which called on the House Appropriations Committee’s Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies to continue their support for Sea Grant. With imported seafood making up 90% of American seafood consumption, this program works to help strengthen the ranks of Long Island’s local fishermen and shellfish farmers.  We must also support our shellfish industry, a historic and rapidly growing industry on Long Island. Blue Point oysters, which originated in the Great South Bay, are now a highly sought after, world famous commodity, and the oyster trade has long been a prominent feature of our district’s economy and heritage. That is why, as part of the Congressional Shellfish Caucus, I've joined my bipartisan colleagues in pushing the Food and Drug Administration to end the impasse over European Union and United States trade negotiations over the import and export of oysters. Long Island’s oyster farmers need access to markets and restaurants in Europe to grow their businesses. Improving water quality is also absolutely paramount in this effort as well. Overdevelopment of waterfront properties, pollution, stormwater runoff, nitrogen loading, harmful algae blooms, and lack of adequate flushing of waterways are all contributing factors to reduced water quality that have caused severely negative consequences for the shellfish population over the past few decades. That is why so many environmental efforts like fully funding the National Estuary Program, which I have long supported, are so vital.   While all of this will help to advance the interests of our fishermen, there is still so much more than can be done in Congress to aid this effort, such as thoroughly reforming the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. This is the main law that governs recreational and commercial fishing in our nation; however, while it was first enacted in 1976, it has not been updated in a decade. Our home, and our fishermen, are unique and they should be treated as such. Reforming the Magnuson-Stevens Act also presents the opportunity to fix New York’s issue regarding Fishery Management Councils (FMCs) and allow our anglers to receive the fair share they have long deserved. Also as part of Magnuson reform, there needs to be improvement in the data and science used to create federal fishery management plans, as well as an improved framework that makes quotas and regulations flexible to each region and species. Maintaining healthy fish stocks is incredibly important, and our fishermen understand this; however this horribly flawed data only results in needlessly limited size and catch limits which serve no one. Without addressing this need, America’s fishermen will continue to suffer under a one-size-fits-all approach that hurts our industry and allows other nations to overtake our markets with their cheap, imported seafood. Last year, the commercial bluefish fishery in New York almost shut down mid-season due to a misguided ruling by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that New York went over its quota for 2015, a decision based off of old data and poor science. While NOAA took a second look at the data that was outdated and wrong and revised their plan, allowing commercial blue fishing to continue, this decision should have never been made in the first place.   In addition to these initiatives, there are other efforts required outside of Congress to give Long Island’s fishing industry a much needed boost. As such, it is imperative that all necessary levels of government come together to cut through the red tape and help grow this industry, including implementing improved permit practices for our commercial fishermen. While a thriving and successful fishing industry is just within our grasp, restricted access to needed permits continues to limit this potential. Industry experts have long derided this cumbersome process which is in dire need of reform. The time is right to change the burdensome licensing and permit procedures that put a cap on this industry’s ability to succeed.   There remains much more that can be done to reinvigorate fishing and shellfish farming. Saltwater fishing is a cherished part of our heritage, and as members of an island community, it is so important that we never let this important aspect of our culture and economy fade away. A single act of Congress cannot resolve all of these challenges, but progress must be pursued in any available direction. We were raised to enjoy the bounties of these waters, and now, we have the pleasure of raising our families here as well. Tens of thousands of residents on Long Island and in surrounding areas utilize this unique resource and need our help.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepLeeZeldin/photos/a.387918101376980.1073741828.386192271549563/804196259749160/?type=3",NA,156,49,21,6,0,0,0,3

H.R. 2182 has received unanimous support from the Long Island and Connecticut House delegations, as well as a coalition of over 65 local and national environmental groups. In order to become law, the bill must also be passed in the United States Senate.  My bill will commission the Government Accountability Office, in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security, which currently ""owns"" the island, to formulate a comprehensive plan for the future of the island. This legislation requires the plan focus on conservation, education, and research and include alternative uses for the island including a transfer of ownership to another federal agency, the state or local government, a nonprofit, or a combination thereof. Allowing for continued research, public access and permanent preservation of the island, H.R. 2182 will suspend laws passed in 2008 and 2011 that mandated the public sale of Plum Island by the federal government to the highest bidder.  Since taking office in 2015, one of my highest local priorities has been to protect Plum Island. The current law, which mandates the sale of the island to the highest bidder, is the wrong path forward. Preserving this island's natural beauty, while maintaining a research mission, will continue to provide important economic and environmental benefits to Long Island. It will also ensure that the state of the art research facility at Plum Island does not go to waste. This bill will now be sent to the U.S. Senate. I, along with the bipartisan supporters of this bill in the House from New York and Connecticut, in addition to the 65+ environmental and community organizations in the Preserve Plum Island Coalition, will continue to urge Connecticut and New York's U.S. Senators to get this important bipartisan legislation over the top in their Chamber.

H.R. 3218 would improve and extend benefits given to veterans, their surviving spouses, and dependents through the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, or the GI Bill. The GI Bill has helped millions of veterans and their families pursue college, vocational opportunities, and other forms of higher education.    H.R. 3218 removes time restrictions and allows future eligible recipients to use the benefits for their entire lives. Currently, there is a 15-year timeline for these benefits. This bill will also provide 100% GI Bill eligibility to Post 9/11 Purple Heart recipients, restore eligibility for veterans whose school closes in the middle of the semester, and create a pilot program to allow servicemembers to take specific high technology courses. In addition, H.R. 3218 would reduce the Department of Veterans’ Affairs’ (VA) administrative costs by consolidating the GI Bill into one program over time.   Supporting our veterans and their families who have sacrificed so much to protect us must always remain one of our top priorities as a nation. The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Education Assistance Act will allow our veterans, as well as their surviving spouses and dependents, to better access the GI Bill benefits which they have earned. After leaving the service, many of our veterans choose to pursue education. It is imperative that these heroes have every opportunity to pursue those career opportunities following military service, and this legislation makes the necessary reforms to better allow this to happen. Additionally, these valuable benefits are often transferred to the family members of our veterans. We must always remember that the cost of liberty is not only paid out by our veterans, but their families as well. In a 21st century economy, higher education is becoming more and more of a necessity. The GI Bill has been helping veterans for over 70 years; H.R. 3218 will improve upon this excellent cause and allow our servicemembers and their families to better prepare for the future.","link","https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-zeldin-announces-house-passage-bipartisan-harry-w-colmery-veterans","zeldin.house.gov",77,22,10,11,0,0,0,0

The White House announced earlier today that the President will be traveling to Long Island to discuss the effort to eradicate the MS-13 gang nationwide.   The rise in gang violence, which is ruining lives, wreaking havoc, and causing irreparable and devastating harm to families, is hitting home in the most personal and tragic way in Suffolk County, where we’ve seen ongoing violence perpetrated by MS-13 and other Central American gangs taking innocent lives and threatening the safety of our schools. I thank President Trump for making it a priority to travel to Long Island tomorrow to address the administration's determined efforts to eradicate this violent street gang.    This past April, the murder of four young men by MS-13 took place on Long Island. Two of the victims, Justin Llivicura, of East Patchogue, and Jorge Tigre, of Bellport, were residents of the First Congressional District. Justin, Jorge and two others were senselessly and tragically murdered by MS-13, using machetes. This is unfortunately just one of the many recent incidents in our community. The crimes of MS-13 have also included gang rape, human trafficking, drug trafficking, and so many other terrible crimes.   The rise in gang violence on Long Island and throughout our country must come to an end. This effort must be an all hands on deck mission from all levels of government: from the enforcement of our immigration laws, international efforts to combat various related criminal activity, to local efforts to educate and rehabilitate as necessary and appropriate. It's also imperative that all levels of government work together with local law enforcement, schools, churches, and other community groups, to help tackle this massive challenge. Children are being targeted for recruitment into gangs early in grade school.   It is greatly unfortunate that some people plan to line the streets in opposition to the President’s visit, shamefully alleging that the President’s motive is to ‘attack immigrants’ and ‘hard working American families’. Nothing could be further from the truth. President Trump and his administration are taking a no nonsense approach at eradicating violent gangs that are murdering innocent Long Islanders and tearing apart families and communities. We should all be working together to eliminate the threats posed by MS-13 and other gang activity. That is of mutual interest for all of us.    Failure is not an option.

It has been very welcome relief witnessing the President and his administration take such an active role to address this urgent threat. What has happened on our island shows how local communities can be so deeply impacted by gangs such as MS-13.    MS-13 and other Central American gangs have wreaked havoc in our neighborhoods from coast to coast, and the problem will only continue to worsen unless strong action is taken against them. The rise in gang violence is one of the greatest challenges we face as a nation, and we must do everything in our power to swiftly bring this to an end. Here, in Suffolk County, this mission is all the more personal. Only a few months ago, four young lives were sadly and brutally cut short by MS-13, two of whom, Justin Llivicura, of East Patchogue, and Jorge Tigre, of Bellport, were residents of the First Congressional District. This tragic occurrence is in addition to many of the other horrible crimes committed by this group, which has included human trafficking, gang rape, drug trafficking, and other deeply disturbing incidents. The horror of their brutality knows no bounds.    This ruthless gang is a scourge upon our community which has taken far too many innocent lives. Every one of us, at all levels of government, has a role to play in combating this threat, and I am proud to do my part as a Member of Congress. As the President noted during his speech today, a key aspect of this is for Congress to advance proposals which strengthen our immigration system and especially our borders. We must also continue to strongly support our local law enforcement and give them every necessary tool to effectively combat gang violence. It is also imperative that we participate in international efforts to combat various related criminal activity and engage in local efforts to educate and rehabilitate as necessary and appropriate.   While some chose to line the streets and protest the President’s arrival with claims that his motives for coming were to ""attack immigrants"", his words today proved that this was simply not true. This administration has taken a hard stance against gang activity, and it is imperative that we come together as one community in rejection of this violence which has claimed too many innocent lives.     This President’s trip to our home was a sign that we have allies in this fight against evil; however, this is only the beginning.

The beauty of this island is breathtaking, and one would think they were visiting a destination thousands of miles away from Long Island.  Originally belonging to the Corchaug and Montaukett Indian tribes, Plum Island possesses a rich history that dates back to the 1700’s. The island is the site of the first battle between British and Continental troops ordered by General George Washington. It also once held Fort Terry, a coastal defense fortification and artillery post that was used up until World War II. Following WWII, the site was used as an animal research facility, where research on infectious diseases was conducted. This facility has grown to become what is now known as the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, and has conducted groundbreaking research on issues that affect all Americans, such as threats to our food supply.  However, in 2005, it was announced that the Animal Disease Center research would be moved to a new federal facility, the Bio-and-Agro Defense Facility (NBAF) in Kansas. In addition, laws were passed in 2008 and 2011 mandating the sale of Plum Island by the federal government to the highest bidder. This is the wrong path forward, and I am committed to halting this misguided action and ensuring a better future for this treasured island. A feature so unique and exotic deserves to be cherished and preserved, not sold off to the highest bidder to be privately developed.  That is why I am honored to have reintroduced my legislation to stop the sale of Plum Island as H.R. 2182, the Plum Island Preservation Act. This bill will suspend the laws that mandated this public sale. In consultation with the Department of Homeland Security, which currently “owns” the island, this legislation will commission the Government Accountability Office to formulate a comprehensive plan for the future of the island. This plan must include alternative uses for the island, including a transfer of ownership to another federal agency, the state or local government, a nonprofit, or a combination thereof, and possess a focus on conservation, education, and research. Public access would be great while continuing a valuable research mission.   This legislation passed the House unanimously in the 114th Congress, as did my amendment to the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act of 2017, H.R. 5485, which would have prohibited any of the funding within the appropriations bill to be used to market or sell Plum Island. I am proud to announce that, in the 115th Congress, my bill has again passed the House with unanimous bipartisan support. I would like to thank all of my colleagues in Congress who have worked alongside myself to advance this important cause, as well as all of the groups and individuals who have lent their support to Plum Island’s preservation. It is now upon the Senate to bring this bill to a vote and have it sent to the President’s desk. For the people of Long Island, this cause is far too important to allow it to slip away.  As members of one community, we value Plum Island as a precious resource that should not be sold off. This has been one of my top local priorities in Congress for an important reason, and I will continue to do everything in my power to keep Plum Island the amazing place it has been for centuries.","status",NA,NA,95,33,12,10,0,0,0,0

Security Council just unanimously passed a massive new sanctions package on North Korea that will target many of their revenue streams and is expected to reduce the nation’s roughly $3 billion total export revenue by more than a third. This is a huge development on multiple fronts, especially with the size of the sanctions and the unanimous vote that included China and Russia. Ambassador Nikki Haley has accomplished what many thought was impossible and will result in much needed increased multilateral diplomacy as well as important economic pressure on the North Koreans. The red line isn’t North Korea launching a nuclear weapon at the United States. The red line must be that Kim Jong-Un can never even have the capability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States. When that capability is imminent, the United States will have no choice but to use that last possible option of conventional and/or unconventional military force. In the meantime, the best possible scenario is to address the need for North Korean denuclearization through the other principles of DIME (Diplomacy, Information, Military, Economics). There are several other dynamics and elements of options to this complex issue, but it cannot be understated how significant the potential is for these new sanctions to apply enormous pressure on Kim Jong-Un to change his behavior. It is in his best interest and his nation’s best interest to do so.","video","https://twitter.com/FoxBusiness/status/894936171914027008",NA,116,60,21,10,0,0,0,1

This is one of the extremes that exist in our society that has a long history of trying to tear us apart. Their violent acts inspired by deep hatred are disgusting, un-American, and unwelcome in our great nation. President Trump has condemned them repeatedly.  Antifa bused in criminals with bats and pepper spray for the purpose of committing acts of violence targeting anyone who was part of the protest against Charlottesville bringing down the statue of Robert E. Lee, whether associated with the KKK or Nazism or neither. In the words of New York Times reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg, the ""hard left"" was just at violent at the protest as the ""alt right"".   These two sides are not equal. They are different. I would add though that it is not right to suggest that President Trump is wrong for acknowledging the fact that criminals on both sides showed up for the purpose of being violent. That particular observation is completely true.   There is an element of our country that has pledged to resist, oppose, and obstruct this President entirely on absolutely everything and anything and to this population the President cannot say or do absolutely anything at all that they won't criticize as long as he is in the office he was elected to serve in last November.  I'm also looking forward to better understanding the reasoning for allowing those individuals on both sides with bats and other weapons looking for a physical fight to be able to so easily confront each other violently instead of being placed in different locations.  The violence we all witnessed is absolutely not the right way to disagree with each other and anyone participating in the violence should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law, and most importantly, the domestic terrorist who murdered Heather Heyer and injured many others.

While training additional Afghan military and law enforcement personnel, there are also other factors that must be considered as part of a winning strategy. Those include: (1) A more stable political environment in Afghanistan; (2) The Afghan government taking control over more territory within its country; (3) Disbanding more of the opposition forces that exist, especially Al Qaeda and the Islamic State threat that exists to the United States; and (4) Improving the security situation in the mountainous border.  The President’s strategy also holds accountable nations like Pakistan, that continue to harbor terrorists who pose a threat to our security, and seeks to strengthen strategic partnerships with nations in the region such as India, that share our common goal of a stable Afghanistan and region.   I have always believed that we should never send our troops into harm's way unless they are sent with a clear strategy to win. We must send our troops to win or not send them at all.

Serving as the home for both Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Laboratory, Long Island is a thriving community for science and technology, and supporting the Center’s mission is vital to continuing this great tradition.  Understanding the history behind this site and its creator is an important part of comprehending the need to support its mission. Nikola Tesla was one of the most brilliant scientists and inventors in human history whose legacy is sadly unknown by far too many. Tesla revolutionized the way we use electricity, making possible many of the basic necessities we take for granted every single day. His work has resulted in incredible advancements in radar and X-ray technology, energy, remote control and so much more. To continue these groundbreaking achievements, Tesla built the Wardenclyffe laboratory in 1901. Sadly, financial hardships and patent issues prevented this visionary from being able to conduct significant testing before much of the equipment was confiscated by creditors, forcing Tesla to abandon the project altogether, unrealized in its potential.  Multiple companies came to own the grounds in the years to follow, but it was ultimately left dormant in 1987, with some believing it would be demolished. However, Friends of Science East, Inc. saw an opportunity to make proper use of the site and began talks with Suffolk County, Shoreham Village, and other entities in an effort to acquire the property. In 2012, an internet fundraising campaign, which raised $1.37 million, resulted in a successful purchase of this amazing property. Recognizing that Tesla never received the respect he had more than earned, this campaign sought to embrace this pioneer’s legacy and give him his long overdue recognition.  Now, over a century later, we have the opportunity to follow through on this untapped potential and turn these grounds into a site of scientific exploration and discovery once again. This effort will convert these grounds into a science and technology museum that features a number of programs and exhibits, including lectures from visiting professors and experts, mentoring for children, an exhibit dedicated to highlighting the accomplishments of Tesla himself, and even possible incubator space. An education firmly rooted in the sciences has become essential in the 21st century, and encouraging Americans to pursue the paths which lead to high paying jobs in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields begins with supporting facilities like this one.  In April, I had the pleasure of visiting the Center to tour the facility and meet with its leaders. Last month, I also attended a great summer exhibit for the Center in Stony Brook. Enriching scientific discovery in our district should be an all hands on deck community effort. Just as we must support STEM majors for university students, allowing our youth to gain an interest in the sciences from a young age is absolutely crucial, and the Tesla Science Center will provide this critical resource.  The Center holds so much potential for Long Island and our scientific community, and we now have the opportunity to revive this site so that it may serve our district for generations to come. Nikola Tesla revolutionized society as we know it, and now, in 2017, we have the ability to fulfill his unrealized legacy at a time when education in the sciences is all the more imperative. I am proud to do my part in Congress to secure science funding for our district. We must never allow our children to lose their love of learning, and aiding the Tesla Science Center to become a hotspot for scientific exploration must be front and center in this mission.","status",NA,NA,203,69,19,11,1,0,0,0

He illegally entered our country, was deported, re-entered illegally, and is now being detained for the murder of an innocent NY-1 resident and U.S. citizen. Where did the system fail? If convicted of the crime, Mr. DeLeon-Tino should serve the max time and then be deported immediately. To prevent the tragic and senseless murder of innocent Americans, the federal government should increase penalties for those who return after they are deported. When the United States deports criminals, it is essential that they do not return to do us additional harm.”   Congressman Zeldin cosponsors H.R. 3004 or “Kate’s Law,” which would mandate a five-year prison sentence for illegal immigrants who return following deportation. This bill was introduced in the 114th Congress by Congressman Matt Salmon of Arizona in the wake of Kathryn Steinle’s murder at the hands of Francisco Sanchez, a seven-time convicted felon and an illegal immigrant who had been deported from the United States five times. Kate’s Law passed the House of Representatives with Congressman Zeldin’s support on June 29, 2017. The bill now awaits action in the U.S. Senate.","status",NA,NA,242,95,59,4,0,1,18,30

If the Obama administration wanted to implement the DACA program, it should have made the case to Congress and try to pass its proposal into law. The administration absolutely did not have the authority to write its own 'laws'. If the proposal did not have the support to pass then it should not go into effect. That is how our process is designed and must be respected.  I support legal immigration. I oppose illegal immigration. If you want to come to America and pursue the American dream, follow the rules. If you commit a crime and are deported, don't come back. Every nation's backbone is its rule of law. It is great to pursue the American dream and to consider yourself a 'dreamer' and everyone in the United States legally should consider themselves 'dreamers', but you have to follow our laws. Period. We should not reward or excuse criminal behavior.   Many find the situation related to minors illegally in our country to be the most challenging. Many of these children involuntarily came to our country very young, have been here for a long time, go through our education system, love our country and are looking to stay here and greatly contribute to our economy and nation's future. What I struggle with the most is how you can possibly allow someone illegally in our country to be given preference over someone who is not in our country solely, because that individual abroad is following the rules and respecting our laws and as a result they are not yet here.  I am completely open to a debate in Congress and among the American people on how to strengthen immigration laws in our country. The system is flawed as evidenced by the number of people currently in our country illegally as well as the preferences, protections and benefits awarded to people who are here illegally. My priority will always unapologetically remain with fighting for the people following the laws, rather than the ones breaking them. We can debate with each other who has our priorities set better until we are blue in the face, but that is where my heart, energy and commitment remains.  As far as how to tackle this massive issue, when you have a leak, are you someone who turns off the faucet first or cleans up the leak first? I'm someone who believes that you should turn off the faucet first. We absolutely should attempt to completely resolve the challenges associated with all of the many millions of people who are in our country illegally, but not first without ensuring that the challenge doesn't multiply despite anyone's best of intentions to do what in their heart they truly believe is right. I can think of various circumstances where deportation won't be the solution, but a blanket rewarding and incentivizing of bad behavior is going to lead to even more abuse of our immigration system by others.  We must secure the entry process into our country and strengthen interior enforcement. We should pursue common ground on what at all to do with people who are already in our country illegally, but proposals that recklessly actually increase the amount of people in our country illegally and incentivize disrespecting and abusing our laws on the books should not be supported. Let's pursue policies that incentivize respecting and honoring our laws on the books, not the other way around. Let's pursue solutions that better secure our entry process and strengthen interior enforcement so that agreements on what to do with people in our country illegally truly results responsibly in less people in our country illegally over time and not more.  I am very much willing to work with any of my colleagues on either side of the aisle on this issue and others to find common ground however possible. I would also strongly encourage anyone on the opposite side of this debate to keep to themselves the character assassinations, name calling, partisan threats and over the top sound bite spin, because if you truly want to work out an agreement for progress, that is absolutely not at all how to get there. Working together productively and substantively, I am hugely confident that long overdue progress can absolutely be achieved at least in part to move the needle more in the right direction.   https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-zeldin-statement-daca-announcement","link","https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-zeldin-statement-daca-announcement","zeldin.house.gov",478,431,147,59,0,0,11,157

According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), on a single night in January 2016, there were 39,471 homeless veterans in the United States. Of those homeless veterans, 26,404 were staying in emergency shelters, transitional housing programs or safe havens while 13,067 veterans were found in places not suitable for human habitation. While veterans constituted only 9 percent of the U.S. adult population in 2015, they made up 11 percent of the U.S. homeless adult population.    The Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) Program, which is authorized by Congress and administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been a critical resource for helping low income and homeless veterans. The SSVF Program provides supportive services grants to private non-profit organizations and consumer cooperatives, which in turn coordinate and/or provide supportive services to very low-income veteran families. Entities receiving supportive services grants must utilize the funds to provide supportive outreach services to homeless veterans and their families. The services include but are not limited to case management services, assistance in obtaining VA benefits, and support in obtaining and coordinating other public benefits available in the grantee’s area or community. In addition, the organizations provide temporary financial assistance to veterans as needed. SSVF prioritizes the delivery of rapid re-housing services to homeless veteran households, an intervention designed to help individuals and families exit homelessness, return to housing in the community, and avoid homelessness again in the near term. Currently, the SSVF program must be reauthorized by Congress every five years. Congressman Zeldin’s bill would make this program permanent.    In 2017, the VA awarded $587,328,694 in 367 individual SSVF grants to organizations across the country. In Suffolk County, $9,445,001 of SSVF grants enabled three organizations to provide services to homeless veterans.    Congressman Zeldin said, “Supporting our nation’s veterans and ensuring all veterans across this great nation receive the proper treatment, care and support is a responsibility we all share. These brave men and women answered the call to service and repeatedly put their lives at risk to support and defend our Constitution and ensure the safety and security of our country. Although homelessness among veterans has decreased since 2010, the issue remains one of national significance – even one homeless veteran is too many. I am proud to introduce legislation which will ensure these heroes receive much needed support services. The SSVF program is fundamental to our efforts to end veteran homelessness as it enables organizations across the country to provide shelter and essential services to members of the veteran community in need. Extending these grants affirms our commitment to ending veteran homelessness across the country and preserves the important programs that so many of our veterans rely upon. Ensuring our homeless veterans have shelter and a safe place to live should never be a partisan issue. Congress must pass this bill and make the SSVF program permanent.”    “We thank Congressman Zeldin for introducing this bill that would make permanent the SSVF program, eliminating the need for future reauthorizations,” said Adrian Fassett, C.E.O. of the Economic Opportunity Council of Suffolk, Inc. “Through this vital program, EOC of Suffolk, Inc. looks forward to continuing to provide housing and other critical support services for low-income homeless Veterans.”   Tom Ronayne, Director of Suffolk County Veterans Service Agency, said, “SSVF has enabled countless veterans to either remain in familiar living environments or provide them with opportunities to get into a safer, more secure and stable living environment. The ripple effect of this is that veterans and their family members remain employed or become more employable. We are very concerned that SSVF remains in place, especially here in Suffolk County where we have one of the largest veteran populations in the country. I wholeheartedly support Congressman Zeldin’s efforts to permanently secure it.”   “Since Services for the UnderServed (SUS) began working with Long Island’s veterans through the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) grant in 2013, we have been able to assist over 2,000 veterans with housing and homelessness prevention services in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. This has had a life-changing impact on veterans and their families. Sadly, homelessness will continue to affect many, and having SSVF in place to help veterans in their time of need is of the utmost importance. SUS fully supports Congressman Zeldin’s proposal to permanently extend the SSVF grant,” said Beth Gabellini, MS, LMSW, Regional Director, Veterans Division Long Island, Services for the UnderServed.   “SSVF plays a critical role in preventing veterans’ homelessness and rapidly rehousing veterans in the event that they become homeless. Without this crucial funding, the incredible progress the Long Island community has made in ending veterans homelessness would be impossible. The Supportive Housing Network of New York supports legislation to make this life-saving resource permanent,” said Laura Mascuch, Executive Director, Supportive Housing Network of New York.","status",NA,NA,51,7,7,3,0,0,0,0

I advocated strongly for this bill and was very pleased to see it pass. This proposal stood tall on its own, but it was all downhill from there. A three month debt limit increase and extension to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) were added without ANY desperately needed reforms. A three month Continuing Resolution was added as well. For years, I'll be scratching my head why this all devolved so much, so fast, in that Oval Office meeting with Pelosi and Schumer earlier this week. I have often heard the preference that the American public does not want Washington, DC governing from crisis to crisis. It is even worse when government makes decisions creating new crises.    National Debt: The national debt has been on an unsustainable path for a long time. Our nation's debt limit needs to be raised and default is not an option. When the debt limit gets raised though, we need to be incorporating productive solutions to move the needle in the right direction towards ensuring our government isn't growing faster than our economy is. Our nation's debt is about to surpass $20,000,000,000,000. We are at the point in this country that it is frowned upon to even ask for a conversation on this issue and that is not right. After today's vote, now we have a new fiscal cliff in December. Hopefully between now and December, there is an epiphany in our great country to use these moments as opportunities for improvements to policy...at all.   Continuing Resolution: Short term Continuing Resolutions are far from ideal when state and local governments, our nation's military and federal agencies, as well as our nation as a whole, very much rely on more consistency and certainty on what the federal budget will look like in the year ahead, and in too many cases, will look like in even the weeks ahead. There are times when short term Continuing Resolutions are absolutely necessary just to keep the government fully open and operational. That just was not the case with today's vote, because also this week, the House was in the process of finishing the entire appropriations process for all of the 2018 fiscal year. While I'm sure that the House appropriations bill would have to be tweaked in a final agreement with the Senate and White House, we should not throw out the baby with the bath water, and should be finalizing an appropriations bill for the entire fiscal year. The American public should always demand that level of hard work and I come to Congress every day fully prepared for that hard work. And now...as I mentioned above, we have a new fiscal cliff to deal with in December. It is time to end the Senate filibuster on appropriations bills. Senate rules are being abused to prevent the appropriations process from ever being fully completed in that legislative chamber.   NFIP: During my past experiences in the New York State Senate and now in Congress, as well as through my work this year on the House Financial Services Committee, I have become very familiar with just how many great ideas for improvements to NFIP enjoy bipartisan agreement. Without today's legislation, NFIP was going to be reauthorized this month for a substantially longer period of time and hopefully also with the necessary reforms to put the program on a path towards fiscal solvency and actuarial sound rates.  While I strongly oppose the Senate amendment to H.R. 601,  I stand fully ready to assist in securing a much better deal for the American public by the new December deadline.","status",NA,NA,146,97,11,9,9,2,0,3

Soon we would shockingly be thrown into a moment of total disbelief of the worst kind as the largest terrorist attack in history would be carried out on our homeland. Unless too young or not yet born, we all would forever remember exactly where we were at that very moment that the towers fell. For all of us here in New York's First Congressional District, these attacks struck a most personal chord in ways once thought unimaginable. So many family members, friends, and neighbors were possibly within the vicinity of these attacks and Long Islanders very anxiously awaited assurances that loved ones were safe; some received the most devastating news possible. Like most Americans, many on Long Island could only helplessly watch in horror as evil struck at the heart of our nation. For other Long Islanders, they would courageously and selflessly risk everything responding directly into the danger to help strangers. Many innocent Americans were murdered that day and what was once a normal Tuesday would forever change our lives and our world. On this 16th Anniversary, we renew our pledge to “Never Forget”.  Nicholas P. Chiofalo of Selden, NY, was not like most Americans. An FDNY firefighter with Engine Company 235 in Brooklyn, as well as the Fire Chief for the Selden Fire Department, Mr. Chiofalo had already been on duty for 24 hours when the call came that there was an attack on the World Trade Center. Without a second thought, Mr. Chiofalo remained on his truck and traveled straight into Manhattan to selflessly serve the nation he loved so dearly. Aiming to save as many lives as possible, this hero in every sense of the word went into the South Tower three times to fulfill his mission. Along with his entire crew, Mr. Chiofalo perished when the South Tower collapsed. His sacrifice was not in vain though, and we will never forget what he did that day. Nicholas, among many others at the World Trade Center, Pentagon, and on United Airlines Flight 93, gave up their lives with infinite courage and honor that day. FDNY, NYPD, all firefighters, police officers, EMS personnel, and any other first responder who served on September 11th deserve our unyielding support.   Many of our surviving 9/11 first responders continue to suffer from illnesses arising from their heroic work at Ground Zero. Exposure to the toxic fumes, ash, and debris have caused many to suffer from deadly illnesses and diseases, including cancer and lung disease. While they may have walked away from Ground Zero, many of these first responders have carried the deadly effects of these attacks ever since. That is why the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act continues to be so critically important for our 9/11 first responders and their families. Through this law, the World Trade Center Health Program and September 11th Victim Compensation Fund ensure proper care for those who answered the call that day and in the weeks and months to follow. These heroes must be provided every ounce of support we have to offer as citizens of the greatest nation on Earth, and we must never fall short in this essential obligation.   We also honor all of the brave servicemen and women who have fought, bled, and fell in the war against terror over the past 16 years. The resolve of the United States led to significant actions taken to secure our country at home and abroad. Our nation’s courageous defenders have put themselves in the line of fire time and again in defense of our freedoms and liberties. We must remain eternally grateful for their countless sacrifices on our behalf.  Like so many others, Nicholas Chiofalo did not wake up that fateful Tuesday with any idea that it would be his last. When that call came though that urgent help was needed at Ground Zero, he knew exactly what he needed to do to selflessly save his fellow man. As Americans, we will never forget what Nicholas and many others sacrificed that day. Despite the darkness of thousands of lives innocently lost, heroes like Nicholas Chiofalo fill our hearts and our nation with a strength that is so powerful and positive. That brightest light will surely never be forgotten nor should it ever.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepLeeZeldin/photos/a.387918101376980.1073741828.386192271549563/828685537300232/?type=3",NA,85,4,11,7,0,0,30,1

From a young age, Nick struggled with anxiety, which sadly led him down the path to heroin addiction as a teenager. He fought this addiction tirelessly with the love and support of his family and friends, and sought several forms of treatment. Sadly, Nick lost his battle with addiction at the young age of 25. Every single day, Americans like this young man fall victim to drug addiction.    On August 31st, I attended a press conference in recognition of International Overdose Awareness Day, where I met Nick’s parents, Francine and Leonard Lafond, and discussed their son who had been laid to rest only two days prior. The courage of these heartbroken parents to come to this event and talk about Nick so soon after his passing is absolutely incredible. Though it is too late to save their son, Francine and Leonard have dedicated themselves to easing the grip of addiction upon our society. There is no one solution to ending the drug epidemic; this is a complex issue involving all levels of government, our community leaders, law enforcement, schools, churches, and everyday Americans. We must continue to pursue collaborative efforts to develop localized community based solutions to tackle this crisis, by increasing treatment, recovery services, and education. This is a poem Nick wrote just weeks before his recent passing:  ""Anxiety is life to me Mixed with some sobriety Throw in notoriety This is my anxiety. Always looking over my shoulder Will this get better as I get older? Carrying it around like a boulder This is my anxiety. Dark holes and deep depression Popping pill after pill in rapid succession How did I not see the progression? This is my anxiety. Days to weeks, weeks to months, and months to years Why is my head constantly filled with fears? Keep a straight face, don’t shed any tears This is my anxiety. Waking up to go to sleep Climbing this mountain seems so steep Close to the edge, I’ll surely leap This is my anxiety.""   It was a privilege to speak on the House floor to share Nick’s story and discuss this critical priority. The complexity of this issue is unrivaled, and we cannot turn a blind eye to any potential effort. This needs to be a highest priority to resolve.

Just like after Hurricane Katrina and the BP spill, we need to immediately appoint a National Incident Commander to marshal all federal resources on the island, civilian and military. This is also essential so that there is one chain of command and aid doesn't get held up waiting for various agency approvals. This is life or death so one chain of command led by an experienced Admiral or General is critical. There needs to be increased flexibility and resources, including fuel, to save additional lives. The response in Puerto Rico is unprecedented in scope and has only just begun. There are many challenges, including lack of communication due to widespread power and service outages. I will continue to monitor the progress, and advocate for additional efforts to assist this very urgent and critical cause.”   Currently, the Department of Defense is providing logistical support that has included getting over 60 hospitals open. Friday, the Pentagon sent a fleet of Air Force jets loaded with supplies and medical personnel. The Army Corps of Engineers has re-opened Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan. FEMA told Congress on Tuesday morning that it had 500 personnel in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Thousands of federal personnel from various agencies are also in the area. FEMA also said that 7 million meals and 4 million liters of water were en route by barge.   The U.S. military said today its initial focus has been on reopening hospitals and Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. At least eight Army Black Hawk helicopters from Fort Campbell are being deployed to PR. The USNS Comfort, the US navy's east coast hospital ship, is now bound for Puerto Rico. This is one of only two DoD hospital ships. It has 1,000 beds, a heavy lift helicopter deck, and 12 operating theatres. As of Monday, the US Coast Guard also had 13 ships off of PR.

However, a burdensome and confusing tax code limits this opportunity. It will only get worse unless we take action to fix it.  We need a fair and simple tax code that delivers desperately needed relief for American workers and improves our business climate, creating economic growth and more good paying, private sector jobs.    I want to see a simplification of our tax code where 9 out of 10 Americans are able to fill out their tax return on a postcard. I want to see my hard working constituents keeping more of their paychecks, experiencing a lower cost of living, and being able to save more for retirement. All of this is possible.   I strongly support cutting taxes for individuals and families, reducing the number of brackets, increasing the standard deduction, eliminating unfair double and triple taxation like the death tax and alternative minimum tax, increasing the child care tax credit, and drastically reducing the amount of deductions, credits, and other complicated provisions so we can have a fairer and simpler tax code.  I also strongly support lowering the corporate income tax rate to become more competitive globally and bring back jobs, companies, and liquidity that have left, as well as preventing any more from leaving. This will also spur more private sector job growth and allow our economy to grow faster than our government. Currently at 35%, we have one of the highest federal corporate income tax rates in the industrialized world.    I will continue to focus on making sure this proposal is a win for hard working individuals, families, and job creators on Long Island, where we have one of the highest costs of living in the nation. I will be assessing the impacts of all proposals, including the debate over whether or not, and how, to maintain the State and Local Tax Deduction, to make sure the final proposal is not just good for America, but most specifically, to make sure the final proposal is good for NY-1.   https://fairandsimple.gop/?utm_source=Rep.+Lee+Zeldin","link","https://fairandsimple.gop/?utm_source=Rep.+Lee+Zeldin","fairandsimple.gop",9,48,3,1,1,0,0,3

This especially rings true here in NY-1, where the water is an incredibly important part of our life and culture. However, with this blessing comes the need to protect ourselves against flooding, which has the potential to cause incredible damage to our homes and property. A crucial part of this defense is reforming the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is now over $25 billion in debt. This year’s particularly devastating hurricane season further emphasizes the urgent need for reform, incentivizing mitigation, reducing repetitive loss claims, achieving fiscal solvency and actuarially sound rates, and more timely adjudication of claims, among other ideas. In addition, too many of those affected by flooding are uninsured; we must have expanded coverage for those homeowners, which includes opening up the private market to increase options for coverage. As a member of the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee in the House of Representatives, I have been working hard to reform this program on a bipartisan basis and reauthorize it for the long term. As a Long Islander, this concern is all the more personal.  In June, along Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D, NY-12), I introduced the bipartisan NFIP Policyholder Protection Act (H.R. 2868) to incentivize mitigation activities. This crucial legislation would result in a credit to policyholders who invest in mitigation, such as elevating their homes, adding porous foundations, or moving boilers to the second floor. Time and time again, I have heard from homeowners across NY-1 that, despite having done the right thing and elevated or otherwise mitigated risks to their homes, they have not received a corresponding drop in their flood insurance premiums. My legislation, which was passed out of the House Financial Services committee on a strong bipartisan vote, will ensure those homeowners receive a credit for their actions, in addition to other great benefits for our district. The advantages of flood insurance reform under this legislation will be tremendous for Suffolk County, and I will be working hard to ensure that this bill is passed and signed into law.  While homeowners should be encouraged to protect their property, we must also realize that some areas are naturally prone to excessive flooding and result in repetitive claims for flood loss. Too many homeowners are opting to live in high risk areas confident they will receive substantial repeated payouts from NFIP. Paying homeowners over and over and over again for flood damage is the quintessential definition of insanity. When the reality is that repeated flood damage is all but certain, we must reform NFIP so homeowners relocate to safer and more stable locations, including buyouts for willing communities and the prevention of overdevelopment along waterfront communities. Reducing repetitive claims is one of many ways to put NFIP on a path towards fiscal solvency and more actuarially sound rates, which is a top priority of Congress’ bipartisan effort to effectively reform this program.  Expanding flood insurance coverage for more Americans is another vital objective. A large amount of those affected by Hurricane Harvey and Irma did not live in properties covered by flood insurance. The coverage map must be expanded as well as lifting the “non-compete” clause in federal law that severely limits the availability of private flood insurance options. By doing so, we can encourage individuals, families, and business owners to seek appropriate and affordable flood coverage before the next storm, increasing competition and consumer choice while lowering costs.  We must also speed up the timetable for FEMA’s claims processing and better utilize digital technology like GIS to improve the flood mapping process. However, none of these ideas will amount to anything if not actually implemented through a long term reauthorization of the program. NFIP was reauthorized last month, without reforms, as part of a short term punt. The American people deserve immediate action.  Flood insurance is an absolute necessity for millions of Americans, and it is unfortunate that NFIP has been beset with these issues. However, we have a very real chance to make much-needed changes to this program. Increasing mitigation incentives, promoting fiscal solvency and actuarially sound rates, repetitive loss claims reduction, introducing more timely adjudication of claims, and expanding coverage while opening up the private market are all excellent and necessary ideas. Now is the time to make much needed reform. I look forward to pursuing any and all legislative options to make real change a reality.","status",NA,NA,61,38,6,2,2,0,0,0

The JCPOA is not in America’s best interests. This so-called “deal” isn’t a pathway for how to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. It is a blueprint for exactly how Iran can acquire a nuclear weapon. It was a very bad, one-sided deal, for what was in the deal, and a very bad, one-sided deal, for what was not in the deal.  In order for the JCPOA to continue, by law, every 90 days, the current administration must recertify that Iran is fully complying with the agreement, and that the suspension of sanctions is both proportionate to the measures taken by Iran to end its illicit nuclear weapons program and vital to protect U.S. national security. The next deadline is rapidly approaching on October 15th.   President Obama declared that this deal wasn’t built on trust; it was built on verification, but I have not met a single American who has read the verification regime entered into between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Iran. When I questioned former Secretary of State John Kerry about the JCPOA at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, even he admitted he hadn’t read it. How do you support a deal based on verification when you don’t even know what the verification is? What we do know is that no U.S. weapons inspectors are allowed on the inspection teams. Iran is inspecting some of their own nuclear sites and collecting their own soil samples. They are also not permitting the necessary access to their military sites, which the IAEA recently asserted as preventing verification that Iran is complying with key terms of the agreement.  Without even asking for a signature, the JCPOA propped up the wrong regime in Iran with up to $150 billion in sanctions relief. Keep in mind that when people talk about how Iran elected the most moderate candidates on the ballot, they often leave out the asterisk that the 12,000 most moderate candidates were denied access to the ballot. None of Iran’s other bad activities were on the table or resolved as part of an agreement that negotiated away all of the leverage that forced Iran to sit down in the first place. These bad activities of the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism include overthrowing foreign governments, illegally test firing Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles, blowing up mock U.S. warships, seizing one of our naval vessels and subsequently holding hostage and publicly embarrassing 10 American sailors, pledging to wipe Israel off the map, and chanting Death to America in their streets on their holidays, all while unjustly imprisoning American citizens. Iranian aggression in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere is only making matters much worse since the JCPOA was entered into.  The President should place the onus completely on the Iranian regime. There is a new Sheriff in town now who will not get rolled. America will not get rolled. The JCPOA is all about Making Tehran Great Again at the expense of all else. If the Iranians need a few days to digest the new reality and step up to the plate, that is ok, but if they don’t, it is time to ramp back up our leverage immediately and I am confident that our allies will recognize that they want to remain our great, willing partners in this effort.  A better deal was necessary and obtainable. No deal would have been better than this deal. With (1) Iran’s bad activities only getting worse than ever before, (2) the JCPOA offering the pathway for Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon with a jackpot of sanctions relief as a signing bonus, and (3) an unknown, secretive verification regime that even our heads of state haven’t read, this deal is clearly not in America’s best interest. Decertifying is the right move. It is past time for an important and most productive course correction.","link","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/10/09/exclusive-rep-lee-zeldin-president-trump-should-not-recertify-iran-nuclear-deal/","breitbart.com",59,108,9,3,4,1,2,20

My bipartisan legislation provides the VA with the flexibility it needs to determine the appropriate limit for veterans’ loans, which will be extremely helpful for veterans who live in areas with a high cost of real estate, such as Long Island.    Supporting our nation’s veterans is a responsibility we all share. These brave men and women repeatedly answered the call to service to ensure the safety and security of our country and protect our democratic values. Not only do we owe our veterans gratitude and respect for the sacrifices they made, we have a duty to provide them with meaningful support to pursue the American Dream they honorably protected, a cornerstone of which is home ownership.    Since taking office in 2015, I have heard from many Suffolk County veterans concerned about securing VA home loans given the limits under current law. My bill is a commonsense VA reform that has bipartisan support to help countless veterans across Long Island and the country.    I am pleased to see the bill pass with such overwhelming bipartisan support. Last Congress, the Flexible VA Loan Guarantee Act was packaged into H.R. 3016, the Veterans Employment, Education, and Healthcare Improvement Act, which passed the House of Representatives with unanimous bipartisan support. I will keep working to get this bill passed again in the House of Representatives.   https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-zeldin-s-bipartisan-veteran-loan-guarantee-bill-passes-house","link","https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-zeldin-s-bipartisan-veteran-loan-guarantee-bill-passes-house","zeldin.house.gov",63,17,9,3,0,0,0,0

The JCPOA in its current form is deeply flawed and one sided for what is in the agreement, and deeply flawed and one sided for what is not in the agreement. It is not a pathway for how to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. It is a blueprint for how Iran can acquire a nuclear weapon.   This ""deal"" propped up the wrong regime, providing Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, with a jackpot of up to $150 billion in sanctions relief, without even asking for a signature. The JCPOA in its current form fails to address any of Iran’s other bad activities, including overthrowing foreign governments, illegally test firing Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles, blowing up mock U.S. warships, seizing one of our naval vessels and subsequently holding hostage and publicly embarrassing 10 American sailors, pledging to wipe Israel off the map, and chanting Death to America in their streets on their holidays, all while unjustly imprisoning American citizens. Since the JCPOA was entered into, Iranian aggression in the Middle East, including Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere, has only increased. These bad activities have only gotten worse, since all of the leverage that brought the Iranians to the table was negotiated away under the JCPOA.   There are many flaws with the terms of the agreement. The verification regime must become adequate and transparent, and Americans should know what the verification agreement is. You cannot support a deal based on verification when you don’t even know what the verification is. Even former Secretary of State John Kerry admitted he hadn’t read it when I questioned him about the JCPOA at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing in the last Congress. We also now know that Iran is able to inspect some of their own nuclear sites and collect their own soil samples, and that U.S. weapons inspectors are not allowed on the inspection teams. There are also massive issues with sunset clauses, access to Iran’s military sites, and much more.   Many of Iran’s other bad activities will need to cease. In the days to come, if Iran is serious about helping turn the JCPOA into a truly reasonable agreement, then they need to make those intentions clear, both in private conversations with the United States and other nations of the P5+1, as well as in their public rhetoric. No games. If Iran does not want to save the JCPOA then the sanctions should immediately ramp back up and I am confident that our foreign allies will assist. I have always believed that a better deal was necessary and obtainable. Even no deal would have been better than the JCPOA in its current form. https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-zeldin-statement-administration-s-decision-not-recertify-iran","link","https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-zeldin-statement-administration-s-decision-not-recertify-iran","zeldin.house.gov",222,173,36,12,1,0,2,74

Tom Suozzi and Rep. Rosa DeLauro. The conference provided the opportunity to review many past successes protecting the Long Island Sound, and to share information and ideas about efforts to best protect the Sound moving forward. The Sound is a precious feature of our life, culture and economy. Over the years, the Long Island Sound has suffered from pollution, overdevelopment and other negative impacts. There has been a lot of progress made, but there is still much more that must be done to protect this critical waterway. Today’s conference with my fellow co-Chairs of the Long Island Sound Caucus brought local, state and national leaders and environmental stakeholders together to discuss the work ahead.   This past May, I voted in favor of H.R. 244, which was signed into law by the President, to fund the Long Island Sound Program at $8 million, an increase of $4 million in funding from the previous year, and the National Estuary Program, which serves both the Long Island Sound and Peconic Estuary, at $26.7 million. H.R. 244 also provides $72.5 million for the National Sea Grant College Program, which works with local producers to grow and sustain their business models while connecting them to local resources to share best practices.   I reintroduced with bipartisan colleagues the Long Island Sound Restoration and Stewardship Act (H.R. 1674) to preserve and protect the Sound. I also reintroduced my legislation to protect and preserve Plum Island, the Plum Island Preservation Act (H.R. 2182), which passed the House with unanimous bipartisan support in July. In addition, I announced in August that Cornell Cooperative Extension Association of Suffolk County had been awarded $120,000 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to remove derelict fishing gear from the Sound.

Under this designation, the Justice Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces will use the federal racketeering statute, or RICO, against this criminal organization. They will also enforce tax and gun laws.   Congressman Zeldin said, “President Trump, Attorney General Sessions, and the administration are taking a no nonsense approach when it comes to eradicating violent street gangs like MS-13 and other Central American gangs. It has been very welcome relief witnessing the President and his administration take such an active role to address this urgent threat, especially here in Suffolk County, where the rise in gang violence is hitting home in the most personal and tragic way. Innocent Long Islanders are being brutally murdered. Families and communities in Suffolk County are being torn apart. In April, the murder of four young men by MS-13 took place on Long Island; two of whom, Justin Llivicura, of East Patchogue, and Jorge Tigre, of Bellport, were residents of the First Congressional District. This is unfortunately just one of the many recent tragedies caused by MS-13 in our community. AG Sessions’ action sends a clear indication that gangs like MS-13 have no place here, and that we will never tolerate gang violence in our communities. Eradicating this criminal organization must be a top priority for our federal, state and local governments.”   In July 2017, Congressman Zeldin traveled with President Trump from Washington, DC, to Suffolk County, New York, when the President visited Long Island to discuss the administration’s effort to eradicate the MS-13 gang in Suffolk County and nationwide.   https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-zeldin-statement-designation-ms-13-enhanced-focus-within-doj","link","https://zeldin.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-zeldin-statement-designation-ms-13-enhanced-focus-within-doj","zeldin.house.gov",128,37,16,9,0,2,0,4

We need a fairer, simpler tax code that would allow Americans to fill out their tax return on a postcard. We also need to improve the business climate, by reducing the corporate income tax rate to create more American jobs, to bring jobs and businesses back from overseas, and to prevent other jobs and businesses from leaving.   On another front, the state and local elected officials responsible for making our state such a high tax state really need to do their part to reduce the tax burden from their end as well, because it is out of control. Our State and Local Tax deduction with the feds is so high, because our state and local taxes are so high.    New Yorkers and all Americans need tax relief from all levels of government. It is my current mission to do my part delivering a tax cut ASAP from Uncle Sam. The last piece of this effort to get this win over the finish line is this important negotiation for major changes to that proposal to eliminate SALT.

I really like many aspects of the current tax reform plan, however, we still have more work to do to get this right, especially with regards to the SALT deduction, which has been in existence for over 100 years. Eliminating the SALT deduction would be a geographic redistribution of wealth, picking winners and losers. New York is a net contributor to the federal coffers with regards to both tax policy and spending policy and that is even with the SALT deduction.    It’s also important to note that the reason why our state and local tax deduction is so high is because our state and local taxes are so high, which is why all levels of government should be working on delivering tax relief. In the meantime, I'm going to fight for my home district and my home state in our nation’s capital.","status",NA,NA,358,219,32,18,1,0,3,5

It has torn apart families, claimed countless lives, and turned once peaceful communities into dangerous neighborhoods. The Central American gang MS-13 in particular has caused irreparable and devastating harm, especially for us here on Long Island.   Only six months ago, four young men, two of whom were residents of the First Congressional District, were brutally murdered by this vicious gang is a senseless act of violence. MS-13’s brutality truly knows no bounds. However, this is a fight which can be won. The federal government is taking a no nonsense approach to eradicate violent gangs, including an announcement just last week that the Department of Justice would be designating MS-13 as a new focus within the Justice Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF). OCDETF is a nationwide effort that utilizes the resources and expertise of the United States’ leading law enforcement agencies to disrupt and dismantle major drug traffickers.  As a result of the Justice Department’s designation, OCDETF will be able to use expanded capabilities to dismantle this vicious gang. This includes not only the federal racketeering statute called RICO, but also drug laws, gun laws, tax laws, and other means as necessary to put an end to this scourge. The task forces are comprised of our top security and law enforcement officials, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Continued death and destruction only emphasizes the need for the Administration's laser-like focus on eliminating this threat.   Under this designation, the OCDETF will now direct its resources on coordinated, nationwide investigations, targeting the activities of MS-13, while assisting in the Attorney General's efforts to generate indictments against individuals who are members of, or otherwise associated with, this vicious gang. Utilizing FBI and DEA intelligence analysts, the OCDETF Fusion Center (OFC) will support coordinated, multi-jurisdictional investigations focused on the disruption and dismantlement of the most significant MS-13 activities. This gang has shown that it is an urgent, deadly threat; this designation will provide the resources necessary to remove MS-13 members, its associates, and its activities, off the streets of Long Island.  We must be working together with allies at every level of government, especially within law enforcement. It is critical that these heroes, who work tirelessly to protect us and have sacrificed so much in the fight against violent gangs, are provided with every means necessary to take down these criminals. Eliminating the threats posed by MS-13 and other gang activity must remain a top priority, and is a mutually shared concern for all Americans.  This past July, I accompanied President Trump to Long Island to discuss the ongoing effort to eradicate MS-13 in Suffolk County and nationwide. This was in addition to Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ visit to Central Islip this past April, when he also addressed the rise in gang violence in our community. Gangs like MS-13 have no place here, and I applaud our allies at all levels of government and in our local communities for their active interest in this dire concern.  As a member of Congress, I have been working hard to ensure our officers are given every tool necessary to carry out their selfless mission. Last year, we passed into law several key pieces of legislation on this front. Some of these bills included the Federal Law Enforcement Self-Defense and Protection Act (H.R. 2137) and Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program Reauthorization Act (S. 125). This progress is important, but there is even more hard work that still lies ahead.  Deadly and disturbing does not even begin to describe some of the horrific crimes committed by this gang, and now more than ever before, we must band together to eradicate MS-13 and all others who intimidate and oppress our communities with violence.","status",NA,NA,82,50,9,2,0,1,5,3

This funding will be used to support the seafood and aquaculture industry, as well as to foster relationships between the industry and next generation of fishermen and other seafood professionals. New York Sea Grant is a crucial program, headquartered at SUNY Stony Brook in New York’s First Congressional District, that provides resources to our local anglers and businesses. This grant will be used to support this vital industry and help preserve our cherished tradition of saltwater fishing. Here on Long Island, fishing is a treasured part of our life, culture, and economy. With imported seafood making up 90% of American seafood consumption, ensuring Long Island’s fishermen and shellfish farmers have access to the resources needed to sustain and grow their businesses is more critical than ever to keep seafood jobs on Long Island and to help the industry grow. Along with Congressman Joe Courtney (D, CT-02), I led a bipartisan group of 95 House members calling for the funding we ended up securing this past May, when Sea Grant was funded at $72.5 million (H.R. 244, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017).

Almost all these scenarios in the chart would be way off for NY-1, because they assume a property tax rate of 1% and state income tax rate of 5%, so nowhere near what most people pay in our district. I appreciate that they published the assumptions behind this chart, because that has been hard to come by with a lot of these hypothetical scenarios being published about tax reform. Also, this chart is only accurate for the first 7 years of the Senate bill before almost all of the individual tax breaks begin to expire.    For “Amber”, who makes $75,000 per year, and ""Kavya and Nick"", who make $85,000 per year, this scenario assumes that they rent and don't own, so it is also important to run these numbers for the homeowner(s) who itemizes and takes the SALT deduction, pays a higher rate of 6.45% compared to what this chart assumes, and depending on the individual, may or may not be currently using various other deductions that are being proposed for elimination.   This gets worse on a sliding scale as you go from left to right to the households that make $165,000, $325,000, $2,000,000, etc., because the higher you go on this chart, the higher the NYS tax rate and property tax bill and hence the more the assumptions in this chart move in the opposite direction of the reality for NY-1, and the more the loss of SALT and some of the other deductions hurt.   For the last retired couple living off of $48,000 per year, these numbers again are assuming they are renters, not homeowners, and do not itemize.   I've been spending weeks and months crunching all of these numbers for so many different kinds of scenarios and I just have too many who will be paying more and on their backs would be financing tax cuts for other people in other states. This can be fixed. It is not too late.

He served our nation in Iraq and Afghanistan and then was brutally murdered by a Palestinian terrorist during an educational tour to Israel in March of 2016. Taylor’s family is just one of the many American and Israeli families who have been robbed of a loved one at the hands of these Palestinian terrorists.  In fact, the Palestinian Authority (PA) incites and rewards this type of violence against innocent Americans and Israelis. The PA, which receives U.S. taxpayer funding, calls their terrorists “martyrs”. They give them burials as if they were heads of state and financially rewards these terrorists for their horrific acts; terrorists just like the one who murdered Taylor Force.    Taylor Force lives on in the hearts of his family, friends, and fellow Americans who will never forget the sacrifice he made for our nation, and, last week, Taylor’s legacy was further cemented as the House unanimously passed the Taylor Force Act. It has been an honor to be the original cosponsor of this legislation.  The values that inspired the Taylor Force Act are the same values that drove Taylor Force to sign up for the United States Military Academy at West Point, to deploy into combat, and to risk everything to protect his country, our flag, and the ideals it represents.   The values of the Palestinian Authority incite violence, reward terrorism, and inspire hate. In stark contrast, Taylor Force embodied the values of our great nation - service, commitment, and the willingness to sacrifice for what we know is right.    Taylor’s legacy is already affecting a change in policy, and as his parents looked on from the House Gallery as we passed the Taylor Force Act, I think the only person who may have been more proud would be Taylor himself.   The Taylor Force Act withholds economic assistance to the Palestinian Authority until it publicly condemns these acts of violence and stops inciting and rewarding the terrorists who perpetrate these horrific crimes, therefore protecting the innocent Americans and Israelis who are targeted each and every day. These terrorists should not be celebrated or financially rewarded, especially not with U.S. tax dollars.  We must stand in solidarity with Taylor Force, his family, and the many other American and Israeli families who have been impacted, by better leveraging every resource we have, including the power of the purse, to hold the Palestinians accountable for their abhorrent support of the murder of innocent Americans.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepLeeZeldin/photos/a.387918101376980.1073741828.386192271549563/875265935975525/?type=3",NA,56,37,4,0,1,0,27,7

My goal in this tax reform mission has always been to ensure the hard working men and women of Long Island keep more of their paycheck, reduce their cost of living, and are able to save more for retirement. Unfortunately, this bill is not the tax relief many Long Islanders had hoped for.   There are many good aspects of this bill, including a necessary reduction in the corporate tax rate, but it should not be done on the backs of ANY hard working, middle income taxpayers. That was totally avoidable and I still don't understand why spending cuts couldn’t have been used as a more responsible pay for.   On balance, this bill remains a geographic redistribution of wealth, taking extra money from a place like New York to pay for deeper tax cuts elsewhere. New York is a net contributor that now will be contributing even more. This bill chooses winners and losers in a way that could have and should have been avoided.   While adding back in the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction to a $10,000 cap was progress, it was not enough progress. While I support fully maintaining the SALT deduction, a better policy if a change was to be made would have been a phase down of SALT over a period of time to a level that fully protects middle income itemizers. With that being said, all New Yorkers must confront the reality that our deduction is so high because our state and local taxes are so high. ALL levels of government must work on tax relief moving forward.","status",NA,NA,167,258,35,1,1,2,16,52

As a permanent member of the UNSC, the United States vetoed this resolution. UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES-10/L.22, which demands the United States rescind its decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, was then brought before the full assembly today where it passed by a vote of 128 to 9 with 35 countries abstaining.    The United Nations General Assembly has taken a very disappointing and audacious vote against the United States, by far the largest contributor to the UN and international global aid, for exercising its sovereign right to place its embassy wherever it deems fit. Moving the United States embassy to Jerusalem, which is in fact Israel’s capital, has been enshrined in U.S. law since Congress passed the bipartisan Jerusalem Embassy Act over two decades ago.    However, while other Presidents have caved to pressure from Pro-Palestinian international actors, President Trump resolutely followed through on this long-overdue decision. Now more than ever, I applaud the strong leadership of Ambassador Haley as she tirelessly fights for our nation and its allies in a body of blindly anti-Jewish international bureaucrats. This is not only an attack on our greatest ally Israel, but an assault on the sovereignty of the US itself.    That’s why immediately following the UN vote I introduced a House resolution with some of my colleagues rejecting this vote and reaffirming our strong support of the President’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepLeeZeldin/photos/a.387918101376980.1073741828.386192271549563/877900972378688/?type=3",NA,173,177,22,31,3,3,3,37
