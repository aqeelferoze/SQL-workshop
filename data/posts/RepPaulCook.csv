While the ACA has done some good things – such as permitting those under the age of 26 to remain on their parents insurance and allowed those with pre-existing conditions to get the insurance they need – too many people have seen the dream of affordable healthcare turn into a nightmare of higher costs, fewer choices, and a tangled web of burdensome regulations.   I believe a “repeal and replace” strategy will serve our country best and allow the greatest number of Americans a chance to improve their healthcare situation. We need a plan that makes it easier for employers to offer affordable healthcare options for their employees and allows greater freedom for people to purchase a plan of their choice.   As we consider these changes the ACA, I want to hear your thoughts. Please be respectful and stay on topic. Please keep your comments on ACA confined to this post, as I’ve had too many off-topic conversations in other posts. Thank you.","status",NA,NA,102,254,45,9,1,2,2,4

Yesterday, President Trump signed the Vietnam War Veterans Recognition Act into law, which designated March 29 as National Vietnam War Veterans Day.
