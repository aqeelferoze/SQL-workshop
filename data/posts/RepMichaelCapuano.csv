Capuano","2017-01-03","2017-01-03 16:26:56","Outrageous – there is just no other word to describe gutting the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE), which is the very first act of the new Republican House. Not the economy, not jobs, not transportation, not even repealing the Affordable Care Act. No, Republicans are starting the year off by crushing the independent House ethics office.  When I wrote the law establishing the independent OCE the whole point was to bring a measure of transparency and accountability to the broken House ethics process. The OCE operates independently of the House Ethics Committee, with the authority to choose which matters merit review.   The practical result of the Republican measure to bring the OCE under the authority of the House Ethics Committee is to render it ineffective. The transparency, accountability and independence of the OCE will be demolished, which is of course the real intention of this rules change.   Heck – even President-elect Donald Trump has chastised House Republicans for their proposal to gut the OCE.   Every outside ethics watchdog group (both conservative and liberal leaning) described the OCE as “the most important improvement in the House ethics enforcement process since the House Ethics Committee was established.” Yes, I wrote the law creating the Office of Congressional Ethics and I am very proud of it.  But that quote is from a coalition of outside ethics watchdogs made up of Common Cause, CREW (most definitely NOT a left leaning group), US PIRG, Judicial Watch (another right leaning group), and several other well respected groups.  The most important aspect of the OCE is to ensure transparency in the ethics process.  Prior to its creation, many complaints were simply buried – maybe people were innocent, maybe not – but no one ever knew what happened.  Because of the OCE, after a well-defined and fair process, America learned if a Member of the House had a complaint investigated and they also learned the outcome of that complaint.  The OCE is not perfect and certainly some minor tweaking of the process may be in order, but the key word here is minor.  Any tweaking should be done in public, so the America people can see the debate for themselves.  If House Republicans bothered to read the report recommending creation of the OCE they would find that very suggestion at the end of it – “The Task Force recommends … a panel of Members to conduct an ongoing review of the ethics process.”  Here is that report – see page 21 for more on that recommendation -  http://oce.house.gov/pdf/Report_of_the_Democratic_Members_of_the_Special_Task_Force_on_Ethics_Enforcement.pdf  The amendment demolishing the OCE was never publicly discussed.  It was proposed and adopted inside a secretive Republican Caucus without anyone outside that meeting knowing it was even going to be debated.  This is not a good way to start – a closed meeting of one Party, held at night, in the basement of the US Capitol, for the purpose of ending transparency in the ethics process.    Personally, I have never witnessed such a rapid march back to the bad old days of the good-old-boys club.","status",NA,NA,245,49,139,1,0,2,14,90

As the Chair of the Task Force that wrote the measure creating the OCE, I am relieved it is not being dismantled today. But make no mistake, the effort to gut the OCE is a stark example of House Republicans’ approach to governing.  Unfortunately, I think we will see a lot more of this in the days and weeks ahead.

Capuano","2017-01-12","2017-01-12 19:51:39","Here is an issue that came up during Ben Carson's Senate confirmation hearing today for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development:  Question: Can we have 30 year fixed mortgage without the government? Carson Answer – Yes.  Question – How? Carson Answer – The private sector.  And now for a brief history lesson …  According to Zillow, the average cost of a house in Boston is now $522,000, in Everett it’s $345,000, and in Randolph it’s $300,000.  Today the rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage with 10% down averages around 4%.  The purchase of a $500,000 home would require a down-payment of $50,000 and a monthly payment of Principal and Interest on the remaining $450,000 of $2,148 per month (or $25,776 per year).  This is hard to do for many people, especially young people.  The last time the government was NOT involved in the mortgage process was before the crash of 1929.  In 1928, the average down-payment required was 50%, the term was 5 years – not 30, and the rate was about what it is today: 4%.  Purchasing that same $500,000 home with these parameters would require a down-payment of $250,000 and a monthly payment of Principal and Interest of the remaining $250,000 of $4,604 per month (or $55,248 per year).   Would YOU have $250,000 for a down-payment?   Even if you do, could you pay it and then afford to pay more than TWICE the monthly mortgage?  If that’s what this new Administration wants – say good bye to the middle class in America!","status",NA,NA,206,34,88,1,1,26,12,63

Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.    “• We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. All three agencies agree with this judgment.”   And also … “We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes.”   I wonder what President Trump will suggest America does about this.","link","https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf","dni.gov",173,44,123,1,0,9,4,45

The statement also issued a clear and direct threat to the Assad regime, declaring that his government would “pay a heavy price” if such an attack were to take place.   Rep. Walter Jones (R-NC) and I filed H.R. 1923 in April, which bars the President from further use of military force against Syria until authorized by Congress.  We are asking our colleagues to support this bipartisan measure. The bill does not suggest how anyone should vote on the issue – each of us should vote our conscience.  We simply believe the President must observe the Constitution and seek Congressional approval before he takes any further military action in Syria.   While we are gravely disturbed at the thought of potentially another chemical attack in Syria, we are also concerned about the “heavy price” the Trump Administration promises to inflict upon Assad and his regime if it includes military action. Any American military response to the Syrian government would be considered an act of war carried out by the United States. According to the U.S. Constitution, no President can unilaterally engage in an act of war and an intentional military strike against a sovereign government, no matter how horrendous that government may be, is most certainly an act of war. Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution is very clear that ONLY, “The Congress shall have Power … To declare war.”","status",NA,NA,131,19,30,6,0,2,1,1

That said, North Korea’s nuclear weapons and the inter-continental ballistic missiles it has developed to deliver them present a grave danger, the greatest danger to world peace today. Nonetheless, this situation does NOT authorize unilateral military action.  If the President concludes an attack is necessary, both the Constitution (Article 1 Section 8) and the law (War Powers Act) clearly require him to come to the Congress for authorization BEFORE taking action. Military action absent such authorization and absent an immediate threat is illegal and unconstitutional.

If you think this conclusion is too far-fetched or too harsh please read this direct quote …       “the longer they talk about identity politics, I got ’em. I want        them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on        race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we        can crush the Democrats.”       - Steve Bannon, Chief Strategist to President Trump,        as published in The American Prospect, August 16, 2017  That is a sad and dangerous basis for political success.  Racism is real and can be addressed only by open and honest discussion and a commitment to move towards true equality.    I believe America wants to improve relations amongst all our races and ethnicities.  Some prefer division, but most prefer tolerance and understanding and are willing to work for it.  I also believe America can handle several issues at once.  We are capable of facing racism in our midst while at the same time working for a better and more equitable economy … improving our health care system … housing all our people … educating our children … caring for our seniors … and much, much more.  This work is not easy, but it is possible … unless we allow leaders like this President to distract us and divide us.  I refuse to allow that.  To those who want him impeached right now I need to say that he is not yet proven to have committed “high crimes and misdemeanors” as required by our Constitution.  His offensive political beliefs and tweets are not enough.  There are several investigations occurring and the day may come when solid proof of real crimes is evident.  But, for America to be true to its own morality, we must wait for the process to play out before we convict someone - I would ask no less for any American.   Even though I do not think impeachment is ripe at this time, I do think it is time for Congress to speak as one.  To that end, I have become an Original Co-Sponsor of a Resolution that would “censure and condemn President Donald Trump for his inadequate response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 12, 2017, his failure to immediately and specifically name and condemn the white supremacist groups responsible for actions of domestic terrorism, for re-asserting that “both sides” were to blame and … for employing people with ties to white supremacist movements in the White House.”  While a handful of Republicans in Congress have been quick to distance themselves from the President’s comments, it remains to be seen whether they are willing to take a more formal step.  I think it is important to send a signal to the country, and the world, that these comments do not represent America.  I plan on doing all I can to defend the progress this country has made over the last 240 years.  I will look for opportunities to make more progress, but don’t expect I will find many for a while.  At the same time, I will continue to work to bring people of all races and ethnicities together.  I refuse to allow the President to distract me from these goals.  I refuse to let him divide us anymore than we already are.  Please, don’t let him distract you either - together we can prove Trump’s strategy wrong - together, we can Keep America Great!","status",NA,NA,215,39,58,26,0,0,0,0

During his campaign, I found myself agreeing with two points candidate Trump made over and over – the need to tame Wall Street and the need to get out of Afghanistan.  As soon as he made his first appointments, it was clear to me Trump would not govern as he had campaigned relative to Wall Street, even though I suspected this would be the case.  Last night’s speech shows Trump has now abandoned his promises about Afghanistan.  Instead of finding a way out, he committed the United States to remaining there during his entire Presidency, without any possibility of “winning” anything.  I voted to send American troops into Afghanistan in 2001 with a specific and achievable mission: to kill, capture and destroy the people who attacked America on September 11th - Al Qaeda.  That mission was accomplished long ago as far as Afghanistan is concerned.  No one ever suggested that America was embarking on a 20 year effort in nation building.  I know Al Qaeda and their off-spring and affiliates are not gone - but they have not been in Afghanistan in any large numbers for a long time.  The war against terror is not a static war confined by geography. The enemy moves amongst countries, blends into various societies, and emerges where and when they choose. I am not sure how to finally defeat this enemy, but I know it will not be done with large standing armies occupying foreign lands.  I recognize that, if the United States leaves Afghanistan, we may have to go back someday to continue the war against terrorism.  That may justify a fixed forward base in Afghanistan and maybe other countries as well.  It does not justify a never-ending territorial deployment of our forces who are putting their lives at risk or the billions of wasted dollars every year.  I am open to any suggestion to win the war against terror, but I know we cannot do it by occupying every country where terrorists hide.  I also know that we cannot demand perfection against terrorists - otherwise we would be occupying England, France, Germany and virtually every country on earth.  Flexibility. Tenacity.  Intelligence.  Commitment.  These are the virtues we need to win THIS war.  Not tired old tactics that have been repeatedly proven failures.

It gives the money left after the cuts to the states and tells them, “You’re on your own, good luck.”  By the way, the bill also:  Allows anyone to go without insurance – most people who will choose to go without are healthy - so the pool of insured folks will contain mostly sick folks – so the costs will increase even more and the coverage will reduce even more.  Imposes no requirements on businesses to provide health insurance  Provides no power to the states to require insurance companies to cover their residents - if they don’t get the rates they seek, they can simply stop providing coverage for your state.  And … most of these change are delayed until AFTER the next election!  So, states will get Billions of dollars less, no additional powers, and are expected to miraculously negotiate with for-profit insurance companies to provide the same level of coverage for less money.  If they can, it will be a miracle.  If the states cannot convince insurance companies to take less money, the failure will be on the states, not on Congress.  Brilliant DC strategy!!!  Some states will simply accept anything the insurance companies offer them.  Some will try to maintain coverage - but will eventually be faced with the economic realities of life.  Either way, the “leaders” in Washington will go into the next election before their voters feel much pain from this bill.  When the pain comes after they are re-elected they simply wash their hands and blame the states for making cuts.  Many Governors and advocacy groups like the American Cancer Society see right through this - Democrats AND Republicans.  Brilliant politics ... Take credit for fulfilling an impossible campaign  promise - do it in a way that will take a few years to unravel - then blame someone else when your scheme inevitably fails (as planned) in a few years.

I keep thinking about guns too. I cherish the Constitution and I support the second amendment. What I don’t understand is why too many Americans think that support of the second amendment means unfettered access to as many types of guns as possible without any restrictions. As far as I’m concerned, that position is indefensible.  The tragedy in Las Vegas is not the first time a “bump stock” device has been used in a mass shooting. For those who don’t know, this is a LEGAL device that someone can buy to modify their semi-automatic gun so it operates more like an automatic weapon. Why would anyone need a device like this?   In June of 2016, after the massacre in Orlando, I posted a warning about the “bump stock” device complete with video from the manufacturing company that demonstrated its effect, availability, low cost (less than $100) and ease of use. The company also boasted that the device was perfectly legal.  Most people who posted a comment shared my opinion but there were, of course, others who claimed the modification I was describing was illegal. It’s not.  By the way - it is interesting to note that the company I referenced is still in business and anyone can buy their device online. Their website is currently down but other companies selling “bump stock” devices have websites up and YouTube pages with demonstrations on how the modification works.  My concern is not the companies themselves, it’s about why such a device is legal at all.  We’ve seen too much carnage and tragedy. I will not post a video that shows how easy it is to convert a gun requiring a trigger pull for every shot into an 800 round per minute gun that mimics a machine gun.  No one should hide behind the second amendment to defend the legality of something like that. Does anyone really need such a deadly weapon to hunt deer or protect a home?   I am confident that the vast majority of my constituents feel the same way I do. I am also sure many are as fed up with the lack of Congressional action as I am on this issue – but we must never give up. It’s taking an unconscionably long time to make any progress on gun legislation but that cannot stop us from trying as hard as we can to change that. Our cause is just, our solutions reasonable and most Americans are with us.  Never give up – I certainly will not.","status",NA,NA,234,33,23,14,0,0,6,0

Last June, after a “bump stock” device was used in Orlando, I posted a warning about the device and tried to draw some attention to its dangers.  I even posted a short, simple, clear video demonstrating its impact.  When tragedies like Las Vegas happen, the National Rifle Association (NRA) and their friends wait silently as gun control advocates fill the airwaves in the days immediately following the attack. The spotlight inevitably fades and ultimately no action is taken. So far, not one single Member of Congress has had to answer for their complacency at the ballot box.  This week the NRA and their friends finally said they are open to imposing some limitation on “bump stock” devices.  The immediate result - sales of these devices skyrocketed!   But let’s take a closer look at what the NRA actually said -   “The National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law.  The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.”  Later it the same statement, the NRA also says this - “we urge Congress to pass National Right-to-Carry reciprocity.""  This is NOT a call for legislative action and I strongly oppose including the “national right to carry” provision in a gun control bill.  According to news reports,  the NRA clarified that they are NOT calling for the re-purchase or confiscation of currently owned devices.  They ONLY seek review and accept “additional regulation” for such devices.  Clearly there is nothing to celebrate yet.  I want to be clear - I am not naive enough to believe that any form of gun control will stop ALL violence or ALL shootings.  But any thoughtful person understands that we must do as much as we can - even if it’s not everything we want.  Preventing or even limiting one mass murder is reason enough to take action.  I hope Congress will vote on some form of gun control.  I am sure it won’t go as far as I want it to and we will have to fight to do more - but I will vote in favor of something that takes a single step forward if I get that chance.  Even if we get a vote on the floor, banning future sales of bump stock devices won’t solve all our problems. There is no question we should do more to take these devices out of circulation altogether.  We must also take action on the “no fly” list, mental health, excessively large magazines and more. I will never give up but we can’t let lack of agreement on everything keep us from taking any step. When it comes to making us safer from gun violence, something is always better than nothing.  Current reports indicate that the shooter in Vegas bought 12 bump stock devices in the last year. Let’s hope we can finally do this one simple act soon - before it happens again.","status",NA,NA,77,11,9,1,0,0,0,0

So today, he chose sabotage with a pen by signing an Executive Order (EO) to establish “association health plans”.  I am reviewing the EO and have grave concerns that it will lead to higher premiums and less coverage for far too many Americans. This is one more action in yet another troubling week.  Although I believe President Trump’s daily Tweets are primarily intended to distract us from more important business, some of his recent statements I think demand a response.   Trump is mad at NBC News for reporting he called for a vast increase in the United States’ nuclear arsenal during a summer White House meeting. This is the gathering that prompted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to reportedly call the President a “moron” based on his lack of knowledge and understanding about nuclear weapons in today’s world. One of his Tweets called out the network and raised the possibility of revoking its broadcast license. This is an outrageous attack on the First Amendment by a sitting President. I am occasionally angered by the media and I think they deserve to be called out when they are wrong or misleading – but every American must accept that the press has a vital role to play in our democracy. Trump took an oath to uphold the Constitution and whether he likes it or not, he has an obligation not only to support, but to champion a free press. Empty threats that clearly violate basic rights protected by the Constitution undermine the Office of the President and offend basic American values.   Trump was busy this morning – his threats to essentially abandon Puerto Rico, devastated by Hurricane Maria, are cruel, unconscionable and beneath the dignity of the office he holds. 3.4 million American citizens are struggling to rebuild their lives. Far too many still lack access to clean water and electricity. Medical supplies are scarce and many roads still not operational. In yet another fit of Twitter pique, Trump rants that the United States can’t stay and help “forever” when it’s been just three weeks. This is both a moral failure and an appalling lack of leadership. I wish I could tell you I’m surprised.","status",NA,NA,141,30,36,1,0,4,24,44

This is troubling and infuriating. Under net neutrality regulations internet service providers (ISPs) are treated like public utilities, or common carriers. Because of this classification, ISPs must treat all internet content the same. ISPs are prohibited from creating so-called fast lanes, charging more money for faster content delivery. This would create a significant disadvantage for small companies and make it harder for everyone to access certain internet content. ISPs could reserve the best quality internet service for big businesses and those in a position to pay more money for easier access. If you believe in net neutrality as I do, I strongly encourage you to make your voice heard with the FCC. The vote hasn’t happened yet and the FCC is still accepting commentary through its website.","link","https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/filings?proceedings_name=17-108&sort=date_disseminated%2CDESC","fcc.gov",106,26,55,2,0,1,5,38

Taking steps to impeach a President is a gravely serious matter. Practically and politically, I think most of us can agree that passing articles of impeachment in this House isn’t realistic at this moment in our history. But sometimes, it’s more important to follow your heart than do the practical or political calculation. Today, I followed my heart and cast a vote to begin a debate on whether this President has committed impeachable acts. It’s time to have an open honest debate on President Trump and his fitness for office.","status",NA,NA,1086,202,128,184,3,7,1,16

So what is Speaker Ryan’s priority next year? Well, he’d like to tackle that pesky federal deficit he’s responsible for growing. How does he propose to do this? By turning tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires and corporations into spending cuts for Medicare, Medicaid and other programs. He said in an interview yesterday that “We’re going to have to get back next year at entitlement reform, which is how you tackle the debt and deficit.""  http://thehill.com/homenews/house/363642-ryan-pledges-entitlement-reform-in-2018","link","http://thehill.com/homenews/house/363642-ryan-pledges-entitlement-reform-in-2018","thehill.com",14,32,48,1,0,2,8,96
