Martin was many things to many people in his life, but through it all, he was a patriot who had relentless faith in the future of Northern Ireland. Amid the violence and despair of the Troubles, Martin believed that peace was possible, and his leadership helped make it a reality.   I saw Martin at the White House St. Patrick’s Day party just over a year ago. President Obama walked by us on his way out, after working the room and shaking hands for hours, and he looked like he had somewhere important to be. But Martin decided that my 90-year-old Irish Aunt Ellen needed a picture with the President, so he grabbed President Obama’s arm with a laugh and made him stand with us while Martin took our picture. I’m grateful to have that memory of Martin and feel blessed to have known him.  I offer my prayers and condolences to Martin’s wife, children and loved ones and to his colleagues and friends around the world. His life is a testament to humanity’s capacity to change, to choose peace over violence and reconcile even the most intractable conflicts. I hope that his legacy will inspire all political leaders in Northern Ireland to reaffirm their own commitment to the ongoing pursuit of lasting peace and prosperity.”","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/world/europe/martin-mcguinness-northern-ireland-ira.html?_r=0","nytimes.com",37,13,11,0,0,0,6,0

Now, it also allows insurers to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions, and it allows states to opt out of essential health benefit requirements for things like maternity care and drug addiction treatment.  “House Republicans rushed to pass this bill before anyone could know how many more people would lose coverage – just to fulfill a campaign promise, give President Trump a so-called ‘win,’ and dump this disaster off on the Senate. Some members even admitted that they’d vote for it just so the Senate can change it and send back a completely different bill. Today’s vote was a win for the wealthy and the Washington way of doing business, and a devastating loss for everyone else in America.    “My constituents spoke out emphatically against this bill, and I will keep fighting to defeat this effort and advance real solutions that will actually make health care more affordable for everyone.

Sending President Trump a bill to protect Dreamers is the least that we can do – and we should follow it by finally taking up comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for all the millions of hard-working, law-abiding undocumented immigrants living in the shadows of American society.""","status",NA,NA,233,62,25,17,0,0,1,11

It’s unlike anything we’ve ever seen before – as many as 58 people dead, more than 500 injured, several in critical condition. But at the same time, it feels like déjà vu.  “Right now, I’m praying for the hundreds of Americans who just lost loved ones and family members and friends. I’m praying for the victims fighting for their lives, for the doctors and nurses and emergency responders working tirelessly to save them, and for all the police officers and firefighters and first responders who risked their lives to save others, who ran towards the threat while helping others get to safety.   “We don’t yet know how or why this happened, what the shooter’s motivation was, how he acquired these weapons, or whether this could have been prevented. The authorities conducting this investigation will try to answer many of those questions for us. But the question of what happens next – whether this will be a turning point, or déjà vu – that’s entirely up to us. It’s up to each and every one of us to decide whether we want to live in a country where public gatherings are dominated by the threat of gun violence. It’s up to us to decide if it’s ok for someone in America to acquire weapons capable of killing 58 people in a few minutes and injure scores more. It’s up to us to decide if we want our police officers and first responders – the heroes we thank and praise after incidents like this – to face that kind of firepower. It’s up to us to decide if this tragedy will finally compel us to act, or if we’ll once again do nothing and wait for another mass shooting to top Las Vegas as the deadliest in American history.  “We can’t prevent every mass shooting in America, but we know without a doubt that we can prevent some. We can’t save every life lost to gun violence in America, but we know that we can save some. The question is whether we care enough to try.”","link","https://kathleenrice.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=405","kathleenrice.house.gov",159,40,34,0,0,1,35,3

I’ve reviewed the allegations against him, and they're as credible as they are repulsive. The women who reported this behavior suffered serious professional repercussions for doing so, which is exactly why so many victims of sexual harassment and assault decide not to step forward. If men who engage in this behavior suffered real repercussions, more victims would speak up — and maybe other men would decide to act like decent, civilized adults and not prey on women who work for and trust and admire them.  Whether it happened 40 years ago or last week, settlement or no settlement, Democrat or Republican — harassment is harassment, assault is assault. We all know credible allegations when we hear them, and the same is true of hypocrisy.","status",NA,NA,208,73,27,17,0,1,1,6

My full statement from this morning:  “When the recent wave of credible allegations of sexual harassment and assault reached Rep. John Conyers, my colleague in the House and a fellow Democrat, I felt we needed to show that we would no longer allow ourselves or our colleagues to be held to a double standard. If we believe the women, as so many of us say we do, then we can’t just go on serving alongside and working with colleagues who we believe have preyed on women – we need to act, and men who have abused their positions of power need to face consequences.   “That’s the standard we expect in the media, in entertainment, and throughout the private sector, and the standard for public servants should if anything be even higher. That doesn’t mean that every politician who faces a single accusation should resign immediately – it means that if we believe the women, we should act accordingly. I believe the women who accused Rep. Conyers. I believe the women who have accused Sen. Franken, Rep. Kihuen, and Rep. Farenthold. And again, I believe all three should resign as Rep. Conyers has.   “I believe and I hope that we’ve made real progress on this issue over the past two weeks. We’ve identified what the standard should be for politicians who violate the public trust by harassing or assaulting women. Now we need to stick to it.”","link","https://kathleenrice.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=419","kathleenrice.house.gov",119,94,8,5,1,0,4,3
