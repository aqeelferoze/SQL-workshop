Likewise, I’m sure we also agree that competition in the marketplace is a good thing.  Unfortunately, Obamacare has been picking winners and losers when it comes to health care – and American families are paying the price due to this lack of competition.  You see, buried inside this bad law is a provision that permanently bans further construction of physician-owned hospitals (POH) and essentially prevents existing ones from expanding.  This is wrong.  Physician-owned hospitals are small in number, so there is plenty of room in the health care market.  It makes no sense to prohibit good hospitals from serving their communities. My bill is about doing the right thing.  Americans want, need, and deserve quality, affordable health care options.

Our country is facing many challenges when it comes to national security, and as a 29-year Air Force veteran I appreciate our new Commander-In-Chief making strides to protect our homeland.

Similarly, tackling illegal immigration and securing our borders will further strengthen national security – not to mention the fact that these efforts do right by hardworking American taxpayers.   President Trump is also right to work with House Republicans as we repeal Obamacare and replace it with commonsense health care reforms.  Not only will folks have more freedom when it comes to health care choices, but getting rid of Obamacare – which has been a major burden on small businesses – will help boost our economy.

Once joined with the reconciliation recommendations from the Energy and Commerce Committee, these bills will make up the American Healthcare Reform Act.  (To read the full bill, visit readthebill.gop.)   Notably, the bill repeals the individual and employer mandate; stops the $1 trillion in tax increases that have hurt American families from all walks of life; continues to protect folks with pre-existing conditions; and allows children 26 and under to stay on their parents’ health care plan.    As a conservative who opposed Obamacare at every turn, I’m pleased that – with a Republican in the White House – we are finally able to move forward with a real plan to repeal and replace Obama’s disastrous law.  While I recognize that the Republican bill is not perfect, it’s a good and necessary step in the right direction – and my work on this issue won’t be done.  There are still many conservative solutions that I would like to see put into effect that budget rules prohibit us from including in reconciliation – solutions like the ability to purchase health care plans across state lines as well as the bill I introduced (H.R. 1101) to allow small businesses to join together through association health plans (AHPs).  In fact, H.R. 1101 passed the Education and Workforce Committee yesterday!  THREE-STEP PLAN TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE: 1)      Pass the reconciliation bill – the American Healthcare Reform Act. 2)      Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price will have regulatory flexibility to deregulate the marketplace to help lower costs and stabilize the market.  3)      Congress will follow up on the reconciliation with further solutions (such as purchasing health care across state lines).","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepSamJohnson/photos/a.10150113515201868.280354.52454091867/10154429829746868/?type=3",NA,15,38,2,0,0,0,0,4

I  also have some special announcements I believe you will be interested in hearing.    First, to all the brave veterans who served in the Vietnam War, I thank you for your service and your sacrifice in the name of freedom.  As a POW for nearly seven years, my POW buddies and I were given a very warm welcoming home upon our return in 1973.  But so many of you were treated unfairly upon your return home from Vietnam and not given the warm welcome you also deserved.  This is wrong.  ALL our faithful servicemen and women deserve our deepest gratitude and utmost respect.  So today, I want to let you know your service and sacrifice is appreciated – and you are welcomed home.    I also want to let you know about 1) an upcoming event in our district on behalf of veterans as well as 2) a resolution I introduced this Congress calling for intensified efforts to account for all U.S. forces who still remain Missing in Action (MIA).   1) On April 8th, in order to help local veterans and their families preserve stories of heroism, patriotism, and sacrifice, my staff will be hosting a training workshop on the Library of Congress’ Veterans History Project (VHP).  Preserving veterans’ stories are so important, and I encourage folks to attend. For information on this event and to RSVP so sufficient training materials are available, CLICK HERE: http://samjohnson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398575   2) Additionally, Senator John McCain and I introduced identical resolutions in the House and Senate calling for intensified efforts to investigate, recover, and identify all missing and unaccounted-for personnel of the United States.

The Inspector General said that as a result, illegal immigrants can get thousands of dollars from the IRS.  It’s no surprise that it also encourages more illegals to come here.

Your service and sacrifice to our Great Nation is appreciated today and always.  I also want to let you know that on Friday I introduced a bill called the HEARTS Act that is focused on ensuring that wounded veterans have access to the care and services they have earned.   Specifically, this bill would address an unintended consequence that affects veterans who are severely injured and qualify for disability due to their military service.   The HEARTS Act would repeal the requirement that these wounded warriors maintain – and pay for – Medicare coverage upon returning to work in order to keep their access to TRICARE.

Insurers are fleeing the Obamacare exchanges, premiums are soaring, and millions of folks have chosen to forgo buying Obamacare-mandated insurance because it’s simply too expensive.  This heavy-handed government program is anything but affordable.  Since Day 1, I opposed Obamacare.  Well, now that Republicans control the House, Senate, and White House, we finally have the opportunity to repeal and replace this bad law.  The first step is passing the improved version of the American Health Care Act, as the House did yesterday.  I will be the first to admit this bill is by no means perfect, but it makes great strides forward within the parameters of what we are allowed to do under budget rules so that we are able to pass the bill with a simple majority in the Senate.  As folks know, there are only 52 Senate Republicans.  I look forward to seeing the Senate’s ideas and getting the best and most conservative bill possible on President Trump’s desk soon.  Bottom line: Americans have been waiting for a repeal and replace of Obamacare for seven years.  Now is the time to help provide access for the affordable health care Americans want, need, and deserve.

Men and women came to America seeking freedom from persecution.  And our Founding Fathers declared their independence to govern themselves rather than submit to a monarchy. As a result of their courage and wisdom, we are blessed beyond measure to live in a country where we enjoy freedom in its many forms.  Let us be thankful for these freedoms – because there are countries and regimes out there that do NOT recognize or celebrate individual freedom.  And some want to destroy ours. That is why the Fourth of July is also a time when we should pass along WHY our freedom is important.  Each of us plays a role in keeping the legacy of freedom alive.  It is our responsibility to protect and preserve our freedom so that we may pass it on to our children.     On that note, let us thank all our servicemen and women – past and present – who have defended our Great Nation.  It is because of your service and sacrifice that we are able to continue living in the Land of the Free.  Your legacy will not be forgotten!      I pray that God continues to bless our Great Nation.  And I pledge to you that I will continue to uphold the values of freedom and individual liberty, which founded America and our Constitution. God Bless you and your families, and God bless America.

Nearly 3,000 people were murdered in these attacks.  But rather than break our spirit as these terrorists intended, our nation united together and folks stepped up to serve their neighbors – and their country.  Eleven years later, in 2012, our American embassy in Benghazi was attacked – again by Islamic terrorists.  Four Americans were killed, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.   Today, the threat of terrorism remains very real, which is why we must continue to be vigilant and do everything within our power to prevent future attacks on Americans.  This is one of the best ways we can honor the memories of those we have lost.  It is also one of the best ways we can show our thanks to our first responders and service members.

As a Constitutional conservative, I am a proud defender of all law-abiding Americans’ 2nd Amendment rights.  Former President Obama, on the other hand, made gun control a priority of his.  He repeatedly tried to impose his radical gun control agenda on law-abiding Americans.  Thankfully, the American people and House Republicans were able to STOP him.   But because he failed in Congress, the former president sought to deny millions of folks their right to bear arms by going through Social Security.   In the final hours of his presidency, Obama finalized a Social Security Administration rule.  His rule would mean certain Social Security beneficiaries who also happen to have someone they know and trust handle their Social Security checks for them would be prevented from buying a gun.  This is WRONG!  Old age or a disability does NOT make someone a threat to society.  All law-abiding citizens should have the right to own a firearm. Period. That’s why on January 30th I introduced a resolution that would stop former President Obama’s gun grab.
