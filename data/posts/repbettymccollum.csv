Millions of Americans will lose their health coverage. Out-of-pocket costs will soar and essential consumer protections will be gutted.

His work engaging with local units of government and the community was integral to the renovation of St. Paul’s Union Depot and the Metro Transit Green Line. He also was diligent providing services to constituents, always determined to achieve a positive outcome for individuals he served. Only two weeks ago, a constituent called my office inquiring about Fred and expressing his appreciation for the help Fred provided him solving a problem years earlier. Fred Gates had a long and illustrious history of public service and DFL politics. He served as Minnesota State Director for U.S. Senator Hubert H. Humphrey during the 1970s.

The Special Counsel investigation has already found serious wrongdoing in President Donald Trump's inner circle and charged President Trump's top aides with felonies. Right-wing efforts to shut down this investigation are a shameful attempt to cover up for President Trump and deny the American people accountability for the Trump-Russia scandal.","link","http://cnb.cx/2Bms8Vv","cnb.cx",140,16,10,2,1,0,2,6

Twenty-four hours later, he broke his word and issued mining leases footsteps from the BWCA to a foreign-owned mining company. Clearly, the numerous assurances I received from Secretary Zinke about protecting the BWCA were worthless and deceitful.  The Trump administration is blatantly dishonest and cannot be trusted.  They are determined to sell, exploit, and destroy the American people’s natural treasures like Bears Ears National Monument, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and now our own Boundary Waters and Voyageurs National Park.
