Sadly, one of the most at-risk groups of Americans to suicide is our Veterans. While the VCL exists to help prevent these tragedies, many calls go unanswered. These flaws with the VCL are unacceptable; if we fail one of our Veterans, we have failed in our duty to all of them. We must do everything we can to give our Veterans the support and care they have earned.   I very much look forward to participating in the Veterans Affairs Committee’s efforts in fixing the VCL’s serious problems.","link","https://veterans.house.gov/news/media-advisories/chairman-roe-ranking-member-walz-announce-hearing-assess-veterans-crisis-line","veterans.house.gov",37,13,9,1,0,1,1,0

The reality is this FCC rule creates a misleading sense of security for users. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the regulatory body that has for years worked in this field to protect consumers’ data. The FCC can only monitor a segment of the Internet, leaving out huge swaths of the web they would not be able to administer. Creating rules enforced by the FCC would apply regulations to only a specific segment of the industry, while giving an unequal advantage and preference to a handful of companies who wouldn’t be under their jurisdiction. This is not the right way to regulate, as it would also undermine the very goal of protecting users’ data.  The Internet should remain a level playing field where consumers are protected consistently across the web, while preventing gaps in consumer protection from being created by any new privacy rules.","link","http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/03/28/house-votes-to-block-obama-era-online-privacy-rule.html","foxnews.com",55,45,11,5,0,1,1,24

My own son has an asthma condition—a pre-existing condition. I've seen health care up close. We need to do the best job we possibly can when it comes to health care so Maine people get the care they need.   I have studied this health care issue carefully with one thing in mind: the People of Maine. I do not work for the Democrats, Republicans, or Washington bosses—I work only for the People of Maine and my focus has been solely on the Maine people.   Maine is in a unique position in this debate. Many people may not know that Maine, and specifically our own bipartisan health reforms at the State Legislature, have become the core model of this new health care legislation, which includes some of Maine's models for welfare reforms as well.   With bipartisan Maine reforms at the center of this new bill, and with Maine having ensured essential health benefits and pre-existing conditions are covered under state laws, I have decided to vote yes on this health care legislation.   Under Maine's 2011 bipartisan reforms, those with pre-existing conditions were covered at the same cost as everyone else, with guaranteed coverage. Maine also ensures EHB’s, essential benefits, are always in place through a series of laws confirmed by Maine's Superintendent of Insurance. I am confident that even if Maine State Government sought a waiver not only would Maine people have essential benefits but pre-existing conditions would fully covered. Our state has already proven it—and our state has proven it can dramatically lower some health insurance premiums and stem the tide of rising costs with its reforms. It has worked in Maine.   I expect the U.S. Senate to make further changes to this bill as it moves on from the House and I welcome those changes. I hope it comes back stronger and better. This simply moves this issue on to the Senate.   ObamaCare is failing, and Congress must act to rescue American families.   We were told, under ObamaCare, if we like our health insurance plan and doctor, we could keep them. We were also told the cost of insurance would drop by about $2,500 per year. Tens of thousands of Mainers switched from their plan at work or were forced to get ObamaCare policies.   However, the monthly premiums and annual deductibles for these ObamaCare policyholders have skyrocketed. And, premiums—right here in Maine—are going up another 14-26% this year. Families are paying a fortune and sometimes never even using their ObamaCare coverage, because deductibles are so high. Instead, they oftentimes choose to pay a fine to the IRS rather than accept an ObamaCare plan.   There are only three insurance providers which offer ObamaCare policies in Maine. One of them, Community Health Options in Lewiston lost $58 million last year. Two weeks ago, Anthem announced it would stop offering Maine ObamaCare policies in January if the failing law isn’t changed.   ObamaCare is failing. We must work to fix this dire situation.   There are powerful special interest groups in Augusta and Washington trying to scare us into doing nothing. They say if we change the imploding ObamaCare law, millions of Americans will lose their health insurance.   Families are already losing coverage because their plans have been cancelled by insurance providers.  The special interests say those approaching retirement and the poor won’t be able to afford health insurance if ObamaCare is changed. That’s not true. They can’t afford it now due to high deductibles and increasing premiums.   If the few providers in Maine offering ObamaCare go under or pull out due to continued massive financial losses, we will have no ObamaCare policies in Maine at all. That is not acceptable.   I was elected to Congress to fix our serious problems. That’s exactly what I’m doing.  If we don’t fix this ObamaCare problem, it’s going to get worse.   In Congress, I will continue to push hard to find important solutions to the dire health care problems and challenges for Mainers. ObamaCare is failing and Congress must act to fix it.","status",NA,NA,279,364,68,4,1,1,13,133

However, no President can simply side-step Congress and create immigration laws on his or her own. The Constitution is clear that the Legislative branch is responsible for passing laws to be presented to the President for signature.  The Obama Administration acted illegally in creating the DACA program in 2012 and, now, the current Administration is facing legal challenges from several states if the DACA policy continues. However, a child should not be held responsible for the actions of parents who chose to break our immigration laws. I believe if those who have been caught in the DACA program have been fully law-abiding members of our society, they should be protected from deportation through legislative action by Congress.  At the same time, we need to continue to secure and control our borders. We need to continue our work to end illegal immigration. Congress must act to improve our border security; to find a solution to address those well-meaning individuals now caught in DACA status; and to update our immigration policies which reduce incentives to break the law.

After testifying before the International Trade Commission (ITC) back in October against these illegal Chinese subsidies, I am thrilled with this strong and encouraging victory for Maine jobs. Mainers can compete and win against anyone, but the rules need to be fair. With the ITC’s ruling, we are leveling the playing field for hardworking Mainers in Presque Isle and for jobs across our State.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepPoliquin/photos/a.400104883499359.1073741828.391924704317377/864409377068905/?type=3",NA,209,51,30,17,0,3,0,1

As I’ve said before, our goal should be to move this project forward in the right way to build a stronger economy that creates more and better paying jobs in the Katahdin Region and in Maine. Secretary Zinke’s recommendation strikes the right balance.  It’s time to move on and move forward, so that we can help build a stronger economy for the region and for Maine.","link","http://bangordailynews.com/2017/12/05/news/state/trumps-interior-secretary-recommends-against-changes-at-maine-monument/","bangordailynews.com",37,19,4,2,0,1,0,19

Iran is the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism and cannot be trusted.

Under this simpler tax code, we are doubling the standard deduction, meaning the average married couple in Maine will not pay any federal income tax for the first $24,000 they earn, a huge boost for our families. In addition, this increases the child tax credit to $2,000, meaning the average Maine family will save an additional $2,000 on their taxes per child in their family. This makes it easier for ordinary Maine families to benefit from the tax code.  This improved tax code will also greatly benefit the more than 140,000 small businesses and job creators throughout Maine and their 275,000 employees by lowering the effective rate for pass-throughs, of which almost all small businesses are organized. It will allow small businesses in all industries to benefit from it. We are giving our small businesses—the backbone of Maine’s economy—relief so they can grow and create more jobs for our fellow Mainers.","status",NA,NA,250,210,36,23,4,0,1,138
