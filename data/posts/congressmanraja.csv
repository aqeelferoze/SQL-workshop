Along with so many throughout the world, I have always believed in the American Dream of our country as a place where regardless of where you come from, the color of your skin, or how you pray, you can build a better life.

As a member of the House Oversight Committee, I’m calling for hearings to determine the root of this wave of hate crimes and how we may best combat these disturbing attacks on our people and American values. From attacks on Indian-Americans to the desecration of Jewish cemeteries to multiple shootings targeting people of color who were told to that this was not their country, these crimes have spanned our nation. The American people have refused to be idle bystanders to this wave of attacks, and have instead stood to resist each new affront to our common values. Recently, cemetery desecrations were met with waves of volunteers assisting in restorations. Mosque burnings were met with contributions from Americans of all faiths who sought to assist in the rebuilding. And when two Indian men in Kansas were shot, and one murdered, for the color of their skin, a third man recognized what was happening and heroically sought to intervene. https://medium.com/@CongressmanRaja/im-calling-for-oversight-committee-hearings-to-address-the-current-wave-of-hate-crimes-deba0668d3e1#.ggzacnpqn","link","https://medium.com/@CongressmanRaja/im-calling-for-oversight-committee-hearings-to-address-the-current-wave-of-hate-crimes-deba0668d3e1#.ggzacnpqn","medium.com",66,9,12,6,0,0,0,0

During this time, I’ve been reminded of Archibald Cox, the Special Prosecutor who uncovered much of Watergate, who I once had the honor of meeting. I think there are lessons we can draw today from the work of Mr. Cox, a Democrat, and the courage shown by the Republicans who helped make his investigation possible. After the details of Watergate began to emerge and the public demanded an investigation, Republican Attorney General Elliot Richardson selected a Special Prosecutor. For that role, Richardson chose Archibald Cox, a scholar and public servant known for his independence. When Cox’s investigation led directly to President Nixon and his associates, Nixon ordered Cox’s firing to try to end the investigation but Attorney General Richardson, a Republican and a man of integrity, refused and resigned in protest. While Cox was eventually fired, his work and Richardson’s courage in defending the independence of the investigation paved the way for the truth of Watergate to emerge. Regardless of what will emerge from our current situation, there is a clear need for either an independent commission or an independent prosecutor to uncover all the facts and address the countless unanswered questions. As was the case decades ago, this will only be possible through the cooperation of dedicated Americans, both Democrats and Republicans.

I'm glad we completed this crucial step because it's a real opportunity to support programs that strengthen our economy and improve people's lives right here in Illinois. Today I want to recognize a career and technical education success story at Harper College: Quinn Wyskochil.  Quinn Wyskochil was struggling to choose a career path until he stopped by an open house for Harper College’s Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) program. He immediately felt at home and in good hands, surrounded by faculty who have years of experience in the field. The 20-year-old Hanover Park resident quickly showed an aptitude for HVAC, excelling in challenging coursework that combines design theory and hands-on service. His early success prompted Career and Technical Programs Instructor Jose Vital to hire him as a student aide in the lab. Vital also recommended Quinn for a position at Rolling Meadows-based Automatic Building Controls, where the Harper student now works as a field engineer.  “I’m finding there’s a new experience around every corner,” said Quinn, who competed in an HVAC contest held by the Chicago Pipe Fitters Local 597. “I get to program entire buildings and make sure they work for everyone.”  Quinn plans to graduate next year with his Associate of Applied Science degree in Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Technology. He said he’s excited by the industry’s bright job outlook.  “HVAC is an enormous tree that’s overgrowing with jobs,” he said. “I could be a single technician or one day I could be a business owner myself. Right now, I’m just learning as much as I can.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanRaja/photos/a.1847461142166157.1073741829.1844412109137727/1933091303603140/?type=3",NA,204,15,18,13,0,0,0,0

In Chewy's case, his own left him in a Las Vegas airport restroom with a note: “Hi! I’m Chewy! My owner was in an abusive relationship and couldn’t afford me to get on the flight. She didn’t want to leave me with all her heart but she has NO other option. My ex-boyfriend kicked my dog when we were fighting and he has a big knot on his head. He probably needs a vet. I love Chewy sooo much — please love and take care of him.”  The story of Chewy and his owner's dangerous situation is sadly not unusual. Domestic abusers often also target their victim's pets and threaten them to exert control. This abuse is particularly insidious because of the love people feel for their pets as members of their family while only 3 percent of domestic violence shelters accommodate pets, an unfortunate reality that sometimes prevents people from leaving dangerous situations.  While we still have a huge amount of work to do to combat domestic violence, I'm proud to cosponsor of the PAWS Act (The Pet and Women Safety ACT) which addresses this specific problem. The PAWS Act would extend grant funding to domestic violence shelters that provide pet housing and include vet costs in restitution payments. By expanding these resources, we can dramatically reduce the number of people forced to choose between finding safety for themselves and staying behind to protect their pets.  Given the limited information on Chewy's owner, it's impossible to say for certain if the PAWS Act could have helped their specific circumstance, but there is no question that it still has the potential to help thousands of people like her and their pets. This is legislation that will improve people's lives and deserves the chance to pass into law.  It should never take the story of a puppy to draw our attention to the needs of women and other survivors of domestic violence; no one's life and death challenges should depend on viral news stories for public attention. But the story of Chewy and his owner can draw our attention to one element of the scourge of domestic violence which we can work to address right now to empower survivors.  Chewy is going to a home full of love, and support, and safety. We don't know what's become of his owner, but I dearly hope she will find herself in a similar position to Chewy's new security. Through legislation like the PAWS Act and confronting domestic violence as a society, we can prevent other people and their puppies from going through what Chewy and his owner did to escape domestic violence.","link","https://www.thedodo.com/close-to-home/dog-note-airport-restroom?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dodo","thedodo.com",297,40,130,89,0,3,127,4

He replied within minutes: “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.”  Four days later, after a flurry of emails, the intermediary wrote back, proposing a meeting in New York on Thursday with a “Russian government attorney.""","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/us/politics/trump-russia-email-clinton.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share","nytimes.com",81,40,20,0,0,11,1,39

The attempt by these top Trump advisors - to solicit the support of a hostile foreign power to win the American presidency - is unprecedented in our history.  Veterans of Republican and Democratic presidential campaigns have come forth to say that if they were approached by a foreign source promising information on an opponent, they would have contacted the FBI. When the Trump campaign’s senior leadership was offered information from the Kremlin as part of an effort to help the campaign, they met with someone they believed to be a Russian government agent.  The need for Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation and our Congressional inquiries to continue has never been more clear. I have no doubts as to the Special Counsel and his team’s readiness to do its part in fully pursuing all criminal investigations related to these revelations but Congress must fulfill its responsibility. Pending any investigation, no one who participated in the Trump Tower meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya should have access to any classified information, especially material relevant to our national security.  Furthermore, all those who participated in the Trump Tower meeting must testify under oath before Congress. Mr. Trump, Mr. Manafort, Mr. Kushner, Mr. Goldstone, and Ms. Veselnitskaya must disclose to Congress the nature and details of their conversations, including any sources in the Kremlin.  https://krishnamoorthi.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-raja-krishnamoorthi-condemns-attempt-trump-advisors-gain-russian","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanRaja/photos/a.1847461142166157.1073741829.1844412109137727/1942080952704175/?type=3",NA,232,37,48,0,0,21,1,33

In terms of flood insurance: • If you have flood insurance, call your insurance agent and begin the claims process as soon as possible. • The National Flood Insurance Program makes flood insurance coverage available to any homeowner, renter or business owner located in one of the more than 22,000 communities that participate in the program. • A structure does not need to be in a floodplain to purchase a flood insurance policy. If you live or own a business in a moderate to low-risk area, you can also get coverage through the NFIP. • Remember: there is typically a 30-day waiting period when purchasing a new policy.  Please be cautious in dealing with restoration companies if your property has sustained flood damage.  Always contact your insurance company first and work with their adjustor, and then consider the following when hiring a restoration contractor—avoid contractors who: • Are not properly licensed  • Have no insurance or are under-insured  • Have no local office address (beware of P.O. boxes and hotel addresses)  • Won't provide local references  • Demand up-front cash or deposit  • Show up on convicted criminals and/or sex offenders list","status",NA,NA,42,2,5,3,0,0,0,0

While most pardons are issued after sentencing, or at least following charges, the President can issue preemptive pardons, as President Ford did when he pardoned President Nixon for all charges stemming from Watergate, even though none had been filed.  Similarly, President Trump could not only issue pardons to associates and family members, and debatably, himself, prior to any charges, he could do so without disclosing he had. White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci has confirmed he's discussed pardons with President Trump and while pardons would be revealed if charges were filed, preemptive pardons could directly disrupt Special Counsel Mueller's investigation by discouraging witnesses from cooperating with the probe. If the pardons were undisclosed, the investigators would have no way of knowing.  The Presidential Pardon Transparency Act directly addresses the dangers of secrecy in these matters while also establishing a policy of transparency in an area which many would assume we already have it.","link","http://thehill.com/homenews/house/344024-dem-rep-to-introduce-measure-requiring-white-house-to-disclose-pardons","thehill.com",228,27,27,27,1,1,0,1

On Friday and Saturday night, armed neo-Nazis, Klan members, and other white supremacists chanted anti-Semitic epithets while passing the synagogue. Online, Nazi websites called for its burning.  Fearing for the safety of its members during Friday and Saturday prayers services, the congregation hired an armed security guard to help safeguard their community. To safeguard the synagogue’s Torahs, including a scroll which had survived the depths of the Holocaust, the congregation moved them to private homes until the gathering of neo-Nazis abated.  Yes, in 2017, in our country, a synagogue feared for the safety of a sacred text which had survived the Holocaust.  But the congregation was not alone. John Aguilar, a US Navy veteran stood alongside the guard outside the synagogue because he felt it was the right thing to do.

The Obama administration initially awarded the $400,000 grant to the Chicago nonprofit Life After Hate through its Countering Violent Extremism program, but the Department of Homeland Security put a hold on the grant before ultimately rescinding it, even after a report the Department compiled with the FBI found that the white supremacist movement had carried out more attacks than any other domestic extremist groups since September 11th.  The same report found that white supremacists were the largest threat of domestic terror to the United States, and would continue to pose a “lethal threat” over the next year. In our letter, which is included below, we question whether Department of Homeland Security officials were aware of this report, if they chose to disregard the report’s findings, and if any senior White House advisors played a role in rescinding the funding to Life After Hate, the only organization which was to receive funding to counter white nationalism through the Countering Violent Extremism program.  https://krishnamoorthi.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressmen-raja-krishnamoorthi-and-danny-davis-question-department-homeland","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanRaja/photos/a.1847461142166157.1073741829.1844412109137727/1959976370914633/?type=3",NA,243,19,48,19,0,3,1,0

Protecting free speech and the right to demonstrate is our responsibility as Americans, in particular when it involves unpopular speech or dissenting opinions.  The last month has clearly raised new questions about how we maintain public safety when such speech is controversial. It's long been established that ""time, place and manner"" restrictions are Constitutional, but every effort must be made to prevent those restrictions from interfering with the practice of free speech. The demonstration in Boston was heartening as a display of massive opposition to hate and white supremacism, but even those on the other side were able to demonstrate and were protected by police. There were also heartening examples of people from the larger demonstration helping to keep the people they were protesting against safe.

The charges in the 12-count indictment include conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, tax evasion, and failing to register their actions on behalf of foreign clients. While these charges are extremely serious, they are likely only the beginning of those Special Counsel Mueller will file as his full investigation into Russian interference in our democracy continues.   Last week, at an Oversight Committee hearing, I questioned the Deputy Commissioner for Operations Support at the IRS if any political appointee – at any agency – had exerted pressure on the IRS to not cooperate with Mueller’s probe. Given that one of the charges against Manafort is tax evasion, this only underscores the importance of all federal agencies having the independence to work with Mueller’s team.

As the table shows, the plan would raise taxes on more than half a million middle-class Illinoisans by an average of $820 dollars each year.  The key to understanding how this bill would increase taxes on working families is to recognize two key components of how those taxes are assessed: what you pay taxes on and the percentage you pay on that amount. This bill is being sold as a tax cut because it reduces the tax rate, but it expands what millions of families are being taxed on by so much they end up paying more. For example: right now, there's something called the ""personal exemption"" which is an immediate deduction of roughly $4,000 for every person in your household, so $16,000 each year for a family of four. But, the personal exemption is more significant than normal tax deductions because it reduces your tax liability whether or not you itemize your taxes or take the standard deduction. If you take the standard deduction, you're being taxed on $16,000 less in income because of the personal exemption. If you're itemizing your taxes, you're also being taxed on $16,000 less in income because of the personal exemption. This is a policy that reduces taxes for every working family but the current tax plan eliminates it so even if you're earning the same salary as you were the year before, if this plan passes, and you have four people in your family you'll be taxed as if you're making $16,000 more per year.  This tax plan also eliminates the deductibility of state income and sales taxes. Right now, if you itemize your taxes, you can deduct the amount you pay in state income and sales taxes. If this bill passes, you can no longer do that.  There are tradeoffs throughout this bill and you can find some who would benefit, but this legislation was not designed to put working families first and that's why 22 million would pay higher taxes under it, on top of footing the bill for its $1.5 trillion price tag.

This matters because President Trump has reportedly explored the possibility of pardoning senior aides, family members, and even himself before the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation come home to roost.  I know the American people are probably fed up from all the gobbling about the gravy train of scandals coming from the administration and officials accused of feathering their nests, but secret pardons are no joke. Unfortunately, there is no legal requirement that the president make public all pardons he issues. As President Ford established, pardon power extends to preemptive pardons, issued before charges are brought. Beyond the American political norms President Trump would be violating through such pardons, secret pardons would also undermine the work being done by Mueller’s team.  By issuing secret, preemptive pardons, President Trump could shield his allies from legal consequences before charges are even filed, sabotaging Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation long before anyone outside the White House would have any idea. To prevent President Trump from issuing secret pardons, if he has not done so already, I’ve introduced the Presidential Pardon Transparency Act to require the president to disclose all pardons within three days of issuing them.

Mercifully, at least two of her sons ultimately survived the war. The text of President Lincoln's letter, which was quoted in the film ""Saving Private Ryan,"" also survived the war and endures as a testament to the wisdom, commitment, and depth of compassion of our greatest president. Here is the text of President Lincoln's letter:  Executive Mansion, Washington, 21st November, 1864 Dear Madam,  I have been shown in the files of the War Department a statement of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle. I feel how weak and fruitless must be any word of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of Freedom.  Yours, very sincerely and respectfully, A. Lincoln.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanRaja/photos/a.1847461142166157.1073741829.1844412109137727/2001957623383174/?type=3",NA,40,6,6,11,0,0,5,0

Any action taken now by President Trump to end Mueller’s investigation would harken back to the Saturday night massacre. https://krishnamoorthi.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-krishnamoorthi-reacts-flynn-guilty-plea-any-action-president-end","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanRaja/photos/a.1847461142166157.1073741829.1844412109137727/2006615639584039/?type=3",NA,145,17,13,12,0,4,1,0

It’s clear that the more people know about this bill, the less they like it, which is why it should be no surprise that they are trying to ram this through Congress with as little public debate as possible.  Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan are combining a giant tax hike on the middle-class with the stealth repeal of a pillar of the Affordable Care Act. This bill would raise taxes on millions of working and middle-class families while cutting them for Republican special interest donors. The Republican leadership’s proposal would throw our health care system into disarray by leaving 13 million more people without health care while driving everyone else’s premiums up by 10 percent. As if these policies weren’t bad enough, they would also cut billions from Medicare while exploding the deficit by nearly $2 trillion.  The Republican leadership is so desperate to pass this bill, they haven’t bothered asking whether they should. This is public policy of the worst kind. I will be voting against this bill, and I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.

There are few documents so compelling in their presentation of our national commitment to religious toleration and acceptance as President Washington's letter to the Hebrew Congregation at Newport. It's worth reading entirety but here's a favorite passage: ""The citizens of the United States of America have a right to applaud themselves for having given to mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy — a policy worthy of imitation. All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship.  It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it were the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights, for, happily, the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.  It would be inconsistent with the frankness of my character not to avow that I am pleased with your favorable opinion of my administration and fervent wishes for my felicity.  May the children of the stock of Abraham who dwell in this land continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants — while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree and there shall be none to make him afraid.""","link","http://www.tourosynagogue.org/history-learning/gw-letter","tourosynagogue.org",49,0,10,4,0,0,0,0
