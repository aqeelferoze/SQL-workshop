Because of the ACA or Obamacare, over 48 million Americans are now covered by mental health and parity laws, and insurance companies can no longer deny coverage for patients needing these lifesaving services. We do need tougher enforcement on this, but I am proud of the hard work our mental health consortium did to ensure these protections for San Gabriel Valley residents and all Americans. Parity is working. It has reduced stigma and led to higher numbers seeking treatment for mental health needs.  Last month bipartisan reforms to strengthen mental health and substance abuse services were signed into law. Repealing the ACA as my Republican colleagues want to do would harm these important advances.

This abhorrent view makes us less safe, adds fuel to the propaganda our enemies are using as a recruitment tool, and should be condemned by all.  This impulsive decision was not thought-out or properly vetted, and it has created much hurt, anguish, and confusion. Proper coordination between agencies and advanced notice given to people involved could have prevented individuals from being detained at ports of entry the last two days.   Amid such darkness, we are inspired by the peaceful demonstrations held at LAX and airports across the country, which reflect our true American values of tolerance and love.

Now President Trump and House Republicans want to repeal the ACA in favor of cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while gutting mental health services for low-income families. I strongly oppose this repeal effort and urge my Republican colleagues to work with us to strengthen the ACA, so more Americans have access to lifesaving care.

EPA’s cleanup of Superfund sites has helped mitigate groundwater contamination of our San Gabriel Basin for nearly 40 years, and we still have a long way to go. Thanks to the EPA, even with more residents, vehicles, and industry, we have cleaner air in LA County than we did decades ago.  Severe cuts to HUD, including the elimination of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, is a slap in the face to hardworking San Gabriel Valley families, already burdened with the scarcity of affordable housing. Cities like West Covina and Baldwin Park have benefitted greatly from CDBG funds, which sustain antipoverty programs, public infrastructure, housing services, and fire and police departments.   It is appalling that Trump, who claims to be in favor of rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure, would slash our federal investment in transportation. His proposal to strike funding for new transit projects and cutting $499 million from the TIGER grant program will make our infrastructure systems less safe and less reliable. Agencies like LA Metro, Foothill Transit, and Metrolink and their riders would be hit hard by Trump’s budget cuts.  My colleagues and I will review the President’s full budget request when we receive it, but we will not tolerate a budget that seeks to eliminate whole agencies and reduce Cabinet-level departments to a level where they can barely function. It is insulting to the millions of taxpayers who trust their government to protect their best interests.

Here is my full statement:  The Affordable Care Act extended health coverage, including lifesaving mental health services, to millions who were never able to get coverage before it became law, thanks largely to Medicaid expansion in California and 31 other states. It banned insurance companies from denying care due to pre-existing conditions, such as Bipolar disorder, Cancer, or Diabetes, giving peace of mind to San Gabriel Valley residents and millions nationwide. It is absolutely appalling that President Trump and House Republicans would now eliminate these protections and restore the worst industry practices, sending us back to the dark ages. I am infuriated by the result of the vote, yet I will continue to fight to increase health and mental health services for every man, woman, and child in this country. Thank you to all of my constituents who called, wrote, and contacted me online, sharing your personal stories and voicing your opposition to TrumpCare. This is so critical for the San Gabriel Valley, and I remain focused as we look to the Senate. http://bit.ly/2qwBoV1","link","http://bit.ly/2qwBoV1","bit.ly",198,33,22,16,0,0,4,3

The manner and timing, two days before Director Comey was scheduled to testify before Congress, raises more questions and casts an even larger shadow over this administration. This is yet another firing of an administration official, following a dangerous pattern and lending itself to a cover-up. No number of firings can shield President Trump from the truth, and it is now more urgent than ever that Congress step in and provide oversight. I join Democrats and Republicans in Congress calling for an independent, bipartisan commission—removed from politics—to get to the truth of the matter. Such a commission would go a long way to ensure the protection of our democracy from foreign agents and restore public trust in the federal government.

Here is my full statement:   President Trump’s budget is a horrible deal for San Gabriel Valley families and outlines the wrong vision for the future of our nation. From devastating cuts to Medicaid, an agency the President vowed not to cut, to eliminating HUD’s Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, the nation’s most vulnerable will suffer while the richest Americans and corporations make out like bandits. One in five of Medicaid’s 70 million beneficiaries who have a mental health or substance use disorder might have no other place to turn for lifesaving care if these sweeping cuts are enacted. Additionally, it inexplicably targets seniors who benefit from Meals on Wheels and takes food out of the mouths of hungry families by reducing nutrition assistance.   This budget is also demoralizing for students and parents as it proposes inadequate funds for critical early childhood education programs like Head Start, which is already stretched thin to meet the needs of our communities. For our future leaders hoping to obtain a college degree and be able to afford it one day, they are offered no encouragement by this President, whose budget slashes Department of Education student financial aid and repayment programs. Our children are our future and deserving of every tool to help them succeed.   The President’s budget reduces the EPA’s operating budget by nearly 1/3, severely undermining the agency’s ability to protect the public and our planet from toxins in the air we breathe and the water we drink. It strikes funding for much needed new transit projects, even as the President pledges to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure. Instead of investing these dollars in shovel-ready projects, President Trump is wasting our resources on increased immigration enforcement. These efforts betray our values and will not make our nation more secure or our people feel safer.   President Trump’s budget delivers a punch to the gut of generations of Americans from young students to seniors. It recklessly eliminates whole agencies and reduces Cabinet-level departments to levels where they can barely function. I strongly oppose President Trump’s budget proposal and urge my Republican and Democratic colleagues to protect hardworking Americans by ensuring these devastating cuts never see the light of day. http://bit.ly/2qh0OBQ","link","http://bit.ly/2qh0OBQ","bit.ly",86,11,10,4,0,2,2,8

Today they made public for the first time a bill that is just as mean and devastating to San Gabriel Valley children, seniors, and hardworking families.   This latest version of TrumpCare guts Medicaid, the largest provider of mental health services and a safety net for many Californians; eliminates the Essential Health Benefits package, which includes prescription drugs, hospitalization, and mental health and substance use disorder services; and weakens critical protections for those with pre-existing conditions, like Bipolar disorder, Cancer, or Diabetes.

This proves your calls, letters, and messages are making a difference, but there is still much work to do. Remember, TrumpCare is not a health care bill but a massive tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of millions of children, families, and seniors. To pay for the tax cut Republicans would take $772 billion from Medicaid, which covers 64% of nursing home residents, 49% of all births, and 39% of all children in America; 1.1 million children in LA County alone will be at risk of losing healthcare if TrumpCare is passed. I urge my Republican colleagues to listen to our constituents and work with us to improve our healthcare system for all. https://apnews.com/4e13fcfe169648e99d14667c05b62eef/Facing-defections,-Senate-GOP-leaders-delay-health-care-vote","link","https://apnews.com/4e13fcfe169648e99d14667c05b62eef/Facing-defections,-Senate-GOP-leaders-delay-health-care-vote","apnews.com",47,12,17,1,3,0,0,0

After abandoning bipartisan, good faith discussions on how to improve healthcare, they have put forth Graham-Cassidy, the worst version of TrumpCare yet!   Their bill would erase the significant progress we have made in ensuring mental health parity in our healthcare system. It would allow states to opt out of covering mental health services, severely limiting access to life-saving treatment for millions of Americans. It also guts Medicaid, the largest provider of mental health services, through which 1 in 3 Californians receive care. Graham-Cassidy weakens protections and could even eliminate coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, like Bipolar disorder, Cancer, or Diabetes. The ACA ended discrimination by insurance companies, and we must not return to those dark ages.   My constituents and the vast majority of Americans strongly rejected these attempts in recent months and will again.

Now he is further threatening their livelihoods, safety, and their existence in the only country they have known and loved. DREAMers are students, coworkers, servicemembers, and neighbors. They are not bargaining chips to be used to construct an abhorrent border wall or advance an extreme, anti-immigrant agenda. The goal of the Trump Administration’s immigration principles is clearly not to protect DREAMers but to further inject fear into immigrant communities, frighten families and children, and drive immigrants deeper underground. President Trump and his administration are not listening to the overwhelming majority of Americans who support an earned path to citizenship for DREAMers. I stand with San Gabriel Valley residents and Americans all across the country in firmly rejecting these cruel, anti-immigrant principles. We call on President Trump to ignore the divisive voices, abandon this inhumane approach, and to work with Congress to pass H.R. 3440, the bipartisan, bi-cameral DREAM Act, today. https://www.scpr.org/news/2017/10/09/76490/how-will-trump-s-immigration-enforcement-wish-list/","link","https://www.scpr.org/news/2017/10/09/76490/how-will-trump-s-immigration-enforcement-wish-list/","scpr.org",34,27,4,0,1,3,2,17

This year’s focus on mental health in the workplace is so critical with the economic cost of depression in the U.S. estimated at $210.5 billion annually; responsible for nearly half of this total are workplace absenteeism and presenteeism—reduced productivity at work. The human cost is often far worse, as the workplace is a common source of stress and pressure that can impact our mental well-being. We must continue to educate ourselves and learn the warning signs and symptoms of mental illness, so we are able to catch problems before they escalate. All of our combined efforts are needed to erase stigma, to ensure our coworkers, employers, and loved ones know it is always okay to seek help. Recent strides in mental health parity laws and changing attitudes among the public have raised the profile of mental health in the U.S. and around the world, but we still have work to do. Together we can continue to elevate this vital issue, bring much needed services to our communities, and save lives.   Mental health in the Workplace is the theme of World Mental Health Day 2017. World Mental Health Day is observed on October 10th every year, with the overall objective of raising awareness of mental health issues and mobilizing efforts in support of better mental health.

These acts of compassion and generosity are so meaningful for many who are still recovering. Beyond physical harm and immediate threats to health and safety, domestic violence can cause emotional and psychological wounds. We must continue to ensure mental health services are readily available at shelters for mothers and their children. I am proud to continue fighting to end domestic violence in our communities alongside Congresswoman Judy Chu and all of the wonderful people at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center In Baldwin Park.

This is why I have always been a strong supporter of Net Neutrality and will continue to fight to ensure equal and unfettered access to the internet. Expansion of free-flowing information online under Net Neutrality has allowed news, sports, and social networking pages to flourish, and the growth in wireless devices over the last decade means this information is at our fingertips like never before. Removing these critical protections, as President Trump’s FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has signaled he plans to do, would threaten consumers’ open access to the internet and restrict our free speech. Over 12 million Americans wrote to the FCC demanding the current Net Neutrality rules remain in place. If you have not yet shared your views on Net Neutrality and wish to do so, call the FCC at 202-418-1000. I strongly urge Chairman Pai and the rest of the FCC Board of Commissioners to listen to the people and uphold Net Neutrality. http://bit.ly/2hZkxnI","link","http://bit.ly/2hZkxnI","bit.ly",74,13,8,8,0,0,0,0

President Trump and his administration have repeatedly denied any link between his campaign officials and the Russians, yet Mr. Flynn is now the fourth person to be charged with such ties. This disturbing revelation underpins the importance of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, which must be able to proceed without interference from the Trump Administration or Congress. A bipartisan, independent commission to fully investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election and to safeguard our democracy from future attacks must also be established without delay. http://www.scpr.org/news/2017/12/01/78383/flynn-scheduled-to-plead-guilty-to-lying-to-fbi/","link","http://www.scpr.org/news/2017/12/01/78383/flynn-scheduled-to-plead-guilty-to-lying-to-fbi/","scpr.org",31,12,4,0,0,0,0,1

We must remain vigilant of any future attempt to shrink these protected areas or undermine the will of our communities. Even though Secretary Zinke did not visit or speak with my constituents during the monument review process, we thank all of the local residents, elected officials, small business owners, community leaders, and conservationists who spoke out in strong support of the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument. Your continued input is critical, as we work to preserve this green space and outdoor recreation area for the benefit of all.  Last Friday, Congresswoman Judy Chu, Congresswoman Norma Torres, Congressman Adam Schiff, Congresswoman Julia Brownley, Representative Alan Lowenthal, Rep. Linda Sánchez, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, US Rep Nanette Diaz Barragán, and I introduced a Resolution to honor the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument, paying tribute to the more-than-a-decade-long process of community engagement that led to its designation.

I have met personally with family members of the victims of this horrific act of gun violence and still cannot begin to imagine their anguish. My prayers are often with them and especially on this somber day.  In response to this unspeakable tragedy the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force was formed, and I was proud to be appointed as a Vice Chair to focus on mental health as a critical component of reform, without stigmatizing those with mental illness. Comprehensive mental health services, including crisis counseling services, must always be made available to those in need, especially in the aftermath of tragedies.  We continue to work diligently to expand mental health services and to address all aspects of gun violence prevention to keep our communities safe. We must honor with action those lost at Sandy Hook, their families, and the hundreds of thousands impacted by the scourge of gun violence in our nation.

Here is my full statement:   Republicans just raised taxes on my constituents and millions of hardworking families. Under the guise of a middle-class tax cut, their bill is a giveaway to corporations and the wealthiest people in America. They promised fairness, but their bill treats working families differently than the wealthy. While the reduction for individual tax rates expires in 2025, the rate on corporations is reduced permanently from 35% to 21%.   The tax scam bill harms San Gabriel Valley residents by limiting the State and local income and property tax deduction to $10,000 and capping the mortgage interest deduction on home loans. It eliminates the individual mandate in Obamacare, which will result in 13 million Americans no longer having health insurance, at a time when more than 100,000 new consumers are enrolling in plans through Covered California for 2018. It explodes the debt by $2.3 trillion, which under the current budgetary PayGo rule paves the way for a $25 billion cut to Medicare next year as well as painful cuts to other vital programs that help working families.  My constituents were not fooled by Republicans, which is why the overwhelming majority have called and written, making clear their strong opposition to this tax scam. They know the bill jeopardizes critical funding for local transportation, law enforcement, firefighters, and schools—all the things on which we rely and hold dear. This tax scam bill is shameful and must never become law. http://bit.ly/2CFrzGI","link","http://bit.ly/2CFrzGI","bit.ly",186,39,21,20,2,0,0,11
