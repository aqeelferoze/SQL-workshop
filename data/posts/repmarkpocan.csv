This budget proposal is first and foremost about helping Scott Walker and not about helping Wisconsinites trying to make ends meet.  The budget creates a new set of talking points for Governor Walker’s future political ambitions, but his record of lackluster job growth in our state speaks for itself.  Walker’s newly proposed investments in the state are meager compared to the austerity measures he has forced on Wisconsin public schools, technical colleges and struggling families. Unfortunately, it’s too little, too late.  Regardless the shade of lipstick Governor Walker puts on the pig, because of his massive cuts to our public education system and universities over the last six years, the state is experiencing a race to the bottom where our public schools are left to raid one another in search for qualified teachers. Teachers are leaving Wisconsin to states like Minnesota where there is greater support for public education. Students across the state are graduating with massive amounts of debt, wages are stagnant and Wisconsin’s job-growth is still sluggish at best.","link","http://pocan.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/after-years-of-destructive-cuts-to-wisconsin-pocan-says-gov-walker-s","pocan.house.gov",614,167,340,7,3,6,91,290

At the end of the day, what matters to hard-working people in this country struggling to make ends meet are actions. So far, this President has done little to improve economic conditions and provide real help for working families. Instead, we have seen an Administration focused on spreading fear and hatred, while putting Wall Street banks and CEOs ahead of working people.  From implementing a ban on people based on their religion to his alarming rhetoric on immigrants like my guest, Lupe ﻿Salermón, the President has made divisiveness a core value of his Administration. While this might play well in Trump Tower or at Mar-a-Lago – the United States is a diverse country full of people who work hard for a better future. The President is moving our country backwards with his divisional stance on immigration and support for tearing families apart to score political points.  There are still a lot of question marks surrounding this President on everything from his tax returns to his conflicts of interest to his potential ties to Russia and their interference in our election. I hope that the American people hear what the President said tonight and hold him to a higher standard when it comes to his actions and policies.","link","http://pocan.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/pocan-statement-on-the-president-s-joint-address-to-congress","pocan.house.gov",462,50,68,36,0,1,14,4

Kicking legally registered voters off the voting rolls stifles democracy and creates an unnecessary burden for voters who find that they have been mistakenly and unfairly removed from the rolls. This problem has potential impacts for more than 7 million people across the country. The Voter Roll Integrity Act will help ensure states cannot infringe upon an individual’s right to vote.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/29/trumps-voter-fraud-commission-wants-to-know-the-voting-history-party-id-and-address-of-every-voter-in-america/?utm_term=.aec1626376f0","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/29/trumps-voter-fraud-commission-wants-to-know-the-voting-history-party-id-and-address-of-every-voter-in-america/?utm_term=.aec1626376f0","washingtonpost.com",289,46,87,19,0,8,4,60

Much like the shooting in Orlando, these innocent Americans were doing something many of us have done, attend a concert. This attack was an act of terror and no one should have to experience a tragedy like the one that unfolded in Las Vegas.  Members of Congress have the power to do something and we must do more than hold a moment of silence. We said never again after the shootings in Newtown, Charleston, San Bernardino, Orlando, and so many others. These events have become far too common and we can’t stay silent when thousands of Americans die from firearms every single year.  As long as Congress fails to act, it is complicit in the deaths of innocent Americans. We must take commonsense actions like reinstating the assault weapons ban, ending the sale of high-capacity magazines, and closing loopholes in the background check system. For too long, Congress has rolled over when confronted by the NRA and the gun lobby and it’s time to finally take a stand. Congress must act now.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/us/las-vegas-shooting.html","nytimes.com",324,88,40,32,1,2,113,6

Republicans claim they are doubling the standard deduction, but in reality, they eliminated deductions like those for state and local taxes, student loan interest, and medical expenses, raising taxes on 36 million middle class households. Hundreds of thousands of Speaker Ryan’s own constituents rely on these deductions, including many that utilize the state and local tax deduction.

That amounts to an annual state subsidy (that is, taxpayer money) of $15,000 to $19,000 per promised job — more than five times the typical subsidy, according to job development specialists.""  ""Experts on both the political left and right say experience shows that the promised rewards are not justified by the cost of extraordinary tax breaks that, if extended to other employers, could bankrupt the state.""","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/10/opinion/wisconsin-business-foxconn-walker.html","nytimes.com",111,33,132,2,3,8,33,132

Despite all of the rhetoric, lofty promises, and downright lies, the GOP tax bill is not written for the middle class, it’s written for corporations and the wealthy. Today, Speaker Ryan and Republicans confirmed loud and clear that their priority is to help corporate and special interests at the expense of working families in Wisconsin and across the United States.  Make no mistake, the Republican tax plan will negatively impact millions of American families, but what Speaker Ryan will do next is even worse. The handouts to corporations and the wealthy from this bill are so drastic that they are projected to balloon the deficit by more than $1.4 trillion, and Speaker Ryan is already planning to use this as an excuse to make massive cuts to programs like Medicare and Social Security.  And while Speaker Ryan has been fighting to give corporations tax cuts at the expense of the middle class, he’s neglected to reauthorize critical services like the Children’s Health Insurance Program and the Federal Perkins Loans Program. When Congress returns in January, I will do all that I can to fight for working families and stop Speaker Ryan’s radical agenda from doing more harm.","link","https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/19/congress-tax-bill-votes-304908","politico.com",137,119,95,7,6,5,74,352
