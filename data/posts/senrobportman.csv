As a result, President Obama has left a key regional ally exposed and has undermined faith in America's commitment to stand by its allies. Today, I am pleased to join a bipartisan group of Senators who stand with Israel and to condemn the administration’s efforts to undermine Israel’s legitimacy and subvert direct peace negotiations. With this Senate Resolution, Congress is taking action against UN efforts to target Israel, while signaling that the UN is not the appropriate body to dictate negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues and the new administration to restore the bipartisan consensus on U.S. support for Israel. http://bit.ly/2jam5xM","status",NA,NA,126,55,17,8,1,0,0,12

As a strong supporter of Career and Technical Education (CTE), I’m pleased that she called CTE an ‘important priority’ and agrees that we must do more to give our young people the job skills to help them succeed.  We must also work to protect the rights of students with disabilities to ensure they have access to a high-quality education.  Betsy DeVos has made clear she will enforce the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and ‘protect the hard won rights of students with disabilities.’  I also agree with Betsy that we must do more to make college education more affordable. Students are facing enormous challenges today, and we must do more to increase access to quality, and affordable higher education options.

It’s good news for the taxpayer, too, because it would make the federal government practice what it preaches and use energy more efficiently. And by saving consumers about $16.2 billion in reduced energy costs, it will help folks who are just trying to get by, bringing down the cost of living, easing the middle-class squeeze, and giving them a few dollars extra at the end of each month that they can use for a needed expense, or savings for an investment in a kid’s college education or for retirement.

With a washer coming off the assembly line every four seconds and dozens of state-of-the-art autonomous vehicles buzzing around the floor, it’s easy to see why Whirlpool is investing in Clyde. During the town hall, we discussed our efforts to help them compete on a level playing field with foreign competition, and I appreciated hearing from them. I will continue my work to crack down on unfair imports and ensure that the workers in Ohio like those I met today get a fair shake. With a level playing field, they can compete with anyone.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/senrobportman/photos/a.99307491073.90517.45243961073/10154299423551074/?type=3",NA,213,321,125,5,1,3,0,61

Out of all the tragic stories I heard today about the drug addiction epidemic and its effects, the most important takeaway from my conversations with those in recovery and those on the front lines of this epidemic is that there is hope. Communities are becoming more and more aware of the devastating effects of this epidemic, and they are fighting back. I’m proud to work with the mayor and others leading the fight here in Fremont, and to do my part by passing the historic CARA legislation, pushing for and receiving $1 billion in new funding, and just recently, introducing the STOP Act to help stop this new wave of deadly synthetic heroins I hear about all over Ohio.

Too many of these people were prescribed a painkiller by their doctor and became addicted or tried a drug prescribed to someone else. In 2012, there were more opioid prescriptions in Ohio than there were Ohioans, and during just one three-month period, 11 percent of Ohioans were prescribed an opioid painkiller. Since then we’ve made progress in stopping overprescribing, but the consequences of addiction have only gotten worse.   Today, I introduced legislation with Amy Klobuchar that would help Ohio continue to make progress against overprescribing by keeping better track of prescriptions and ensuring that addiction is discovered and treated as early as possible. http://bit.ly/2oCxi97","link","http://bit.ly/2oCxi97","bit.ly",111,134,38,0,1,1,5,17

It serves as a stark reminder of the costs of American inaction and the need for a coherent strategy for addressing this conflict and its devastating consequences. The Assad regime will not cease these brutal and illegal attacks unless it has a credible belief that the United States and our allies will hold it accountable for its crimes. The Obama administration undermined U.S. credibility and abdicated America’s leadership role when it abandoned its infamous red line in 2013. We cannot afford to make the same mistake twice.   The Assad regime’s actions also highlight the failure of the Russian-led ceasefire agreement to remove Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal and prevent future acts of violence like the attack today. As with the daily violations of the Minsk agreement by Russian-led separatists in Ukraine, its recent violations of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treatment with the U.S., or the Assad regime’s actions today in Syria, the track record of recent Russian-brokered agreements has been an abysmal failure.  That is why sustained American leadership is necessary to address this crisis that is getting worse by the day. Whether it’s the humanitarian catastrophe, the spread of terrorism, or the general growth of instability and sectarian violence throughout the region, none of these issues can be solved without the context that creates them. The Syrian regime’s repeated war crimes against its own citizens have fueled all of these crises. Only a coordinated and comprehensive effort by the United States and our allies to address this root cause of the problem and pave the way for a transition to a post-Assad future can bring an end to the violence and devastation that has plagued Syria and spread all over the world.","status",NA,NA,157,436,30,1,3,6,36,110

I also discussed the trade relationship between our countries and the importance of trade that is free and fair to both countries, where we have a level playing field for American workers, critical industries, and important American exports like beef. I also brought up the growing problem of synthetic heroins like fentanyl and carfentanil coming in from China to the U.S. The issue of these synthetic forms of heroin is affecting both countries, and I asked the Chinese to work with the U.S. to help address this problem and be better partners in the fight against illegal drug trafficking. This influx of fentanyl back home is making an already devastating drug epidemic even worse, but the uncontrolled flow of these addictive substances is not just dangerous for the United States. Other countries can suffer the consequences as well, so I believe it is also in the interest of China and other countries to help us crack down on this problem. Finally, I raised the issue of respecting human rights and dignity as important ways to further strengthen our relationship.

Businesses pay the highest tax rates in the industrialized world, putting them at a disadvantage with their foreign competitors and forcing jobs and investment to leave the U.S.  Our broken, outdated tax code hasn’t been reformed in more than 30 years. Today serves as an important reminder that if we want lasting economic growth and job creation, Congress must make tax reform our top priority.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/senrobportman/photos/a.99307491073.90517.45243961073/10154455832866074/?type=3",NA,45,168,3,2,8,1,0,16

The restored wetlands help keep phosphorus from entering the Lake, and that helps prevent large-scale algal bloom outbreaks, like the one that caused Toledo’s water crisis in the summer of 2014. It also stops harmful bacteria from getting to the beaches at the state park. That’s a problem that has shut down our beaches in the past. The GLRI has been proven to work to protect Lake Erie, something that is critical to Ohio’s fishing industry, our tourism industry, and the drinking water of 3 million Ohioans.   After touring the wetlands, I visited The University of Toledo Lake Center. GLRI funds have benefited Lake Erie Center by supporting $5.7 million of research and monitoring.

The film sheds light on this heinous crime and on the market leader in online sex trafficking: Backpage. As many of you know, our Senate investigation was the first to uncover that Backpage knowingly facilitated criminal sex trafficking of vulnerable women and young girls and covered up evidence of these crimes in order to increase its own profits. Backpage instructed its staff to edit adult ads to cover up incriminating words, and they even set up an automatic filter of their advertisements that deleted specific words like “teenage,” “little girl,” and “lolita”– and then published the edited ads.    I am actively exploring bipartisan legislation to protect women and underage girls and to ensure that this never happens again. We must do everything we can to stop this crime.

Governor Christie has a passion for this issue and I believe he will be constructive partner with Congress and the president to help us make more progress on this issue.   My message to the governor and the White House is this is a crisis, and we have to act quickly.  I’m committed to making the president’s commission successful, but it will only be successful if the White House makes decisive action a priority in the coming weeks.  At the meeting today I outlined six steps that the White House can take right now, including:   1. Help us pass, and enact into law, the STOP Act to prevent dangerous synthetic drugs like fentanyl from being shipped into the U.S. via our postal system.  The president endorsed this legislation last year. 2. Fully support, and help us enact into law, the Prescription Drug Monitoring Act to help stop overprescribing.  3. Support continued full funding of the Comprehensive Addiction & Recovery Act (CARA), which provides more resources for prevention, treatment, and recovery programs across the country, including our law enforcement.  4. Support $500 million in funding for opioids from CURES in FY 2018.  5. Use executive authority to direct HUD to increase access to sober housing for people coming out of treatment. Under the Obama administration, sober living facilities lost priority if they had a zero-tolerance drug policy.   6. Fully implement CARA and get the law’s grant programs up and running.  Only three of the nine programs have been implemented. I laid out 13 specific steps that the administration could take immediately from the needed public awareness campaign that CARA authorizes to implementing the grant program to help first responders get the Narcan and Narcan training they need.   Over the last year, Congress has taken a leadership role in addressing this crisis, enacting my Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and providing $1 billion in new funding for treatment through the CURES law.  In order to reverse the tide of addiction, we have much work ahead of us and that’s why we must act quickly.

You have to balance competing priorities and be respectful of every hard-earned taxpayer dollar. I believe we must work to balance our budget without raising taxes, and I think we can do that by advancing pro-growth policies like tax and regulatory reform as well as restraining spending. As we review this budget and make decisions during the appropriations process, we must prioritize efforts to strengthen our national security and help protect the most vulnerable.  I appreciate the fact that the White House has changed course and will support the work of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. I had a productive conversation with OMB Director Mulvaney recently about the work of the drug czar's office and I’m pleased the White House will support its essential programs to combat drug addiction. We must continue to support these and other programs, such as CARA and the CURES law, which are aimed at prevention, treatment and recovery services that so many Americans desperately need.  I was also pleased to see that the budget request proposes an increase in funding for the cleanup work at the former uranium enrichment plant in Portsmouth. This request would ensure there are no layoffs and that cleanup of the site stays on track.  Having said that, I continue to oppose this budget’s proposed elimination of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. This bipartisan program helps protect our environment and strengthen Ohio’s economy.  We won the fight to restore full funding for GLRI for this fiscal year, and I will continue to help lead the effort in the Senate to do so again next year – just like I did when President Obama proposed cutting the program.","status",NA,NA,157,329,31,6,13,2,5,112

Ohio is known for our highly skilled workforce, and these Ohioans using cutting edge technology are a perfect example. Better technology has the potential to lower costs, make us more energy independent, and ultimately create more jobs with better wages here in Ohio.

Now, with the pullout of Anthem in Ohio, there are at least 20 counties without a single insurer offering health coverage on the ObamaCare exchange. And many other counties will have only one insurer, with no competition to get costs down for families. This is a problem not just in Ohio but across the country. Approximately one-third of the counties around the United States now only have one insurer, and more and more counties are seeing their last insurer leave just like those in Ohio.  Without true competition and choice in the market, we will never be able to lower health care costs for families and small businesses. This is one more reason why the status quo on health care is unsustainable. The Affordable Care Act has failed to meet the promises that were made to Ohio families. We can and must do better than ObamaCare, but we should do it in a way that protects the most vulnerable in our society.

As I learned today in my meeting with Hamilton County Coroner Dr. Sammarco, traffickers are now lacing cocaine and other drugs with fentanyl to make it more addictive—and more deadly.

The NDAA authorizes additional funding for the Abrams Tanks and Styker Vehicles, both of which are worked on at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center in Lima.   The more than $1.8 billion in funding for Abrams tanks builds on over six years of work to ensure the future of JSMC and the tank industrial base. In 2011 the Obama Administration proposed shutting down the Abrams tank line hoping it would be instantly ready in 2018 to start back up.  We knew that plan wouldn’t work and would end up costing the taxpayers significantly more to rebuild the industrial base and delay getting needed capabilities to our soldiers.  Because of our efforts, today the workers at Lima, and at suppliers in Ohio and around the country, are ready to deliver the world’s most capable battle tank to our deployed soldiers.  This funding will significantly increase the rate of production of these modernized tanks and ensure the industrial base is ready for the production demands ahead. In today’s dangerous global security environment, the work being done in Lima is even more important to our accomplishing national security objectives overseas. For more information on the Abrams tank funding, go here: http://bit.ly/2t1JFSW  The Stryker is the Army’s most versatile and deployable combat vehicle.

The Subcommittee’s bipartisan investigation culminated in a hearing and report that showed that Backpage has been more deeply complicit in online sex trafficking than anyone had imagined.  I support the Communications Decency Act and the cause of internet freedom, but it’s clear to me that the CDA was never intended to protect those who knowingly facilitate criminal activity – and in this case knowingly facilitate the sex trafficking of vulnerable women and young girls. I look forward to the results of the Department of Justice criminal review. I will continue working with my bipartisan colleagues to introduce legislation that will fix this problem once and for all, and help ensure we are doing everything possible to save men, women, and children from the scourge that is sex trafficking. http://bit.ly/2tMyoVf","status",NA,NA,169,140,7,6,2,3,0,4

I think the Affordable Care Act has not been good for Ohio. Premiums and deductibles have skyrocketed, typically for middle class families and for small businesses. This has been a huge problem. I had some constituents come in today and a guy and his wife told me about their premiums going up, and more importantly for them is that their deductible is so high it’s like they don’t have insurance. They’re in one of those counties that’s having a tough time because insurers are leaving. So it’s not just that Ohio has suffered from a nearly doubling of our health care premium costs just in the last four years—82 percent increase in small businesses—but there’s also been a lot fewer choices.    We now have 19 counties in Ohio without a single insurer in the individual market. We have another 27 counties now with just one insurer. So it’s a real problem, and we need to lower the cost of coverage and at the same time provide access to quality care and protect the most vulnerable, particularly because we expanded Medicaid. I’ve been very clear about that. I’ve expressed my concerns about the existing healthcare system, but also about the proposal that came out of the House, and the proposal that came out of the Senate initially. I don’t think they were responsive to what we have going on in Ohio, which is not just expansion of Medicaid, but an opioid epidemic and Medicaid is a significant payer for that. But I’ve rolled up my sleeves and I’ve worked to find common ground with my colleagues to try to come up with positive solutions that are in the best interest of Ohio and our country and I’m going to continue to do that.   I have said consistently that I support repeal and replace, and I’m not giving up on doing both of those things. I don’t think it’s appropriate just to repeal, we’ve also got to put a replacement in place to help deal with the very issues I just talked about. Over the past year, as I’ve said, we’ve had a lot of destabilization of our insurance market in Ohio. That’s true around the country. Ohio has been hit harder than most states. When the 2015 bill was passed we had at least two insurance companies providing insurance, writing insurance in every Ohio county. Most counties had multiple insurance companies. We’ve gone, during that period, from 16 insurance companies in Ohio to about 10. And again, 19 counties now have no insurance company in the individual market and 27 only one insurer. So there’s an urgency here for Ohio, and the best approach I think is to continue to work with my colleagues in the hopes that we can come together around a replacement plan that actually works to address these problems. These are real problems and we can’t ignore them.","status",NA,NA,1099,3256,255,56,13,8,47,616

Over the past several years, because of ObamaCare, families and small businesses have seen their insurance costs skyrocket as choices have shrunk. We now have 19 counties in Ohio without any insurers in the exchanges, and 27 counties with just one insurer. With more and more Ohioans facing higher costs and limited options, I am committed to repealing and replacing this law with better solutions. But as ObamaCare is replaced, it must be done in a way that gives all Ohioans access to affordable health care.  The most recent version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) is an improvement over the first Senate bill. The measure includes reforms that will help lower premiums on families and small businesses and provide $45 billion in new resources for states to address the opioid epidemic and give recovering addicts an opportunity to access treatment as they work to get back on their feet. I continue to have concerns, however, about the Medicaid policies in the bill, and that’s why I’ve been working to ensure that those on traditional Medicaid will have access to care and those on expanded Medicaid continue to have good health care options under a new system, including affordable health care options on the private market.  Over the last week, I’ve continued to have good conversations with the president, the vice president, administration officials and my colleagues about ways to improve this bill further, including a plan to help those on Medicaid expansion and other low-income Americans get access to affordable health care on the private market. I am pleased that I have received a commitment that the Senate will vote on this plan as a central part of this process.","status",NA,NA,769,4132,204,38,17,16,249,2516

Stopping trafficking is one of the great humanitarian and human rights causes of the 21st century. Our bipartisan investigation showed that Backpage knowingly facilitated sex trafficking on its website to increase its own profits, all at the expense of vulnerable women and young girls. For too long, courts around the country have ruled that Backpage can continue to facilitate illegal sex trafficking online with no repercussions. The Communications Decency Act is a well-intentioned law, but it was never intended to help protect sex traffickers who prey on the most innocent and vulnerable among us. This bipartisan, narrowly-crafted bill will help protect vulnerable women and young girls from these horrific crimes.

Ohio has the most skilled workforce anywhere in the world, and Ohio’s Whirlpool workers make a world-class product as efficiently as anyone. In Clyde, a washer comes off the assembly line every four seconds, and dozens of state-of-the-art autonomous vehicles are constantly buzzing around the floor. I have seen this firsthand and have met with hundreds of Ohio’s Whirlpool employees; it is easy to see why Whirlpool continues to invest in Clyde and its workers. However, Ohio manufacturers are too often faced with foreign competitors who cheat on trade.  For years, Whirlpool has been hurt by unfair practices from their overseas competitors, who continue to look for ways to cheat, including by moving their production facilities to China. That is why I am committed to giving these workers a fair shake against unfair trade practices. With a level playing field, these workers can compete and win against anyone, and I will continue to work to ensure that our Ohio manufacturers get the level playing field they deserve. http://bit.ly/2gQUjqt","photo","https://www.facebook.com/senrobportman/photos/a.99307491073.90517.45243961073/10154858703326074/?type=3",NA,104,72,11,7,5,1,1,4

This legislation takes critical steps toward protecting Lake Erie and other freshwater bodies throughout Ohio and the nation from toxic algae.  It is important that these water bodies are protected, as they supply drinking water to millions of Ohioans and are critical for Ohio’s tourism and fishing industries. I am pleased that this program has provided a toolkit and forecasts that help our communities prepare for and respond to the impact of HABs. For the first time, our legislation also allows funding to be potentially provided to communities with significant HAB outbreaks to help protect against environmental, economic, and public health risks.

This is a big day for our country, our economy, and our efforts to create more jobs and provide better wages for all Americans.  While our economy has been improving, not every American is feeling the effects of that improvement.  Too many Ohio families are facing the middle-class squeeze of stagnant wages and a higher cost of living. They deserve relief, and a strong economy that enables them to live out their God-given potential.   Our current tax code encourages U.S. companies to take jobs and investments overseas. The United States is falling behind while other countries are attracting more investment and more jobs at our expense. That is unacceptable. Our reform effort will encourage more investment in America, bring jobs home, and give American workers a competitive advantage.  I’ve been working with Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, Chairmen Hatch and Brady, my Finance Committee colleagues and the Trump Administration over the last nine months on this plan and I’d like to thank them for their hard work to get us to this point.  I’ve been very pleased to see President Trump talking about the urgency of this issue around the country, including again today in Indiana.  I’m optimistic about the prospects for getting tax reform signed into law this year.  Working together, we can simplify our tax code in a common-sense way to increase investment here in America, create more jobs & increase wages for American workers.

Since I came to the Senate in 2011, we’ve had 70 hearings on tax reform in the Finance Committee. And next week, we will begin the process of considering this bill in committee, where every member will have the opportunity to have their voice heard and offer amendments to this proposal.  The structure of the House and Senate proposals are similar, and while some of the details are different, I’m confident we can resolve them and get this done.  Our plan is focused on three things. First is middle-class tax relief to help Ohio families who are dealing with this middle-class squeeze where expenses are up and wages are flat.  With this plan, a median income family of four will save nearly $1,500 a year on their taxes. Instead of going to their tax bill, that money can go toward gas or groceries, a car payment, retirement, college savings, or a family vacation. Second is helping make American companies more competitive so we can create more jobs and increase wages here at home instead of encouraging businesses to leave for other countries, which is happening now. Third is leveling the playing field internationally so we can bring back jobs and investment. It’s crazy that we have a tax code that encourages companies to send jobs and investment overseas, and it’s outrageous that Congress has allowed this to happen.  Our plan will fix this and help bring jobs and investment home. We’ve listened to the American people, and now it’s time to deliver on our promise to reform this broken tax code.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senrobportman/videos/10155009661201074/",NA,211,899,46,12,59,6,8,474

Our work together culminated in the Senate Commerce Committee’s unanimous support for the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act – bipartisan legislation now cosponsored by 53 senators. We are pleased that this legislation has the strong support of major stakeholders in this debate, including victims and advocates, law enforcement, the civil rights community, faith-based groups, and the larger tech community.  We are confident the full Senate will pass this proposal very soon in an overwhelming, bipartisan fashion.   It is disappointing that the House Judiciary Committee rushed through a new proposal after House members expressed concerns that it had not been fully vetted and was opposed by all of the leading organizations dedicated to supporting trafficking victims. Any legislative effort must ensure that trafficking survivors get the justice they deserve. Unfortunately, this rushed House proposal raises the legal standard and ensures that bad actors like Backpage continue to have blanket immunity. Don’t take our word for it; the victims advocacy groups have told us with a clear voice that the House Judiciary bill is harmful to our efforts to protect trafficking survivors.    “We’re in this fight to help trafficking survivors who’ve long been denied justice and ensure that state and local prosecutors have the tools they need to hold accountable bad actors that knowingly facilitate online sex trafficking.  As this process moves forward, we will continue the dialogue with all stakeholders, but we’re not going to enact a hollow proposal masquerading as a serious solution. http://bit.ly/2ktCxr6","status",NA,NA,95,329,7,4,21,3,2,105

Providing lethal weapons to Ukraine will send a clear message that America stands with the Ukrainian people in their nearly four year struggle to secure a democratic, prosperous, and independent future for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. This decision--while long overdue--will reverse the Obama administration's de facto arms embargo against Ukraine and will finally allow Ukraine to access the tools it needs to defend itself. As co-founder and co-chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus and author of several provisions authorizing expanded U.S. military assistance--including lethal aid--and establishing the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, I hope that this decision opens the door to the full implementation of the bipartisan legislation Congress has already passed to help the Ukrainians defend themselves against Russian aggression.","status",NA,NA,288,532,44,27,43,6,6,419

This bill is made in America, for America, and I look forward to the president signing it into law soon.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senrobportman/videos/10155111290031074/",NA,236,1015,24,27,110,1,23,765

While our economy is improving, too many families today are still dealing with the middle-class squeeze of stagnant wages and higher expenses. Providing tax relief for middle-class families and reforming our business tax code to create more jobs and boost wages is the right thing to do, and I was proud to play a significant role in helping craft this measure. I’m pleased that we’re already seeing a positive response from employers rewarding their workers with better pay and bonuses while increasing their investments in their businesses and their communities. These historic tax cuts will help create a better economy and a better future for all Americans, and I’m pleased that they are now the law of the land.","status",NA,NA,511,1233,55,68,153,9,22,1095
