In Clio, I met Allen Lytch, owner of Awesome Deals consignment store. And in Patrick we met Chris Gainey who serves up the biggest double cheeseburger at Bill's Grill.

At the end of the day, we all didn't agree on everything but that's okay. What we did find is that more often than not we had more areas of common ground than areas where we disagreed.

Today in Darlington I sat down with Mayor Gloria Hines and local community and ministry leaders about problems they're facing in their community. The real root of the problem here, as in so many other areas in our district, is not enough hope and opportunity for our kids. Kids graduate high school and leave for a job or leave for college and never come back because they have no hope and no opportunity. This lack of hope is the root of the crime problems, the drug problems, family deterioration problems, and so much more. We shared ideas and although we didn't get to specific solutions, what we did get was a solid foundation to build on. Through ideas and collaboration we can create opportunity for our youth and restore opportunity where it's so badly needed.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/reptomrice/photos/a.403408313082581.96379.403403083083104/1340495426040527/?type=3",NA,8,3,0,0,0,0,0,0

I also had the privilege of seeing basketball players from Coker College, public school teachers, and veteran Scott Allen who I'm proud to say is alive and healthy after coming to my office for help getting a liver transplant following his trouble getting care through the VA.   The crowd was very knowledgeable and we discussed a wide range of topics including education, immigration, tax reform, and the environment. Right now, South Carolina is 50th in the country in education, so I am in favor of school choice because we have got to do something to give our kids a chance. I believe we need to start actually enforcing the immigration laws we currently have while shifting our focus toward enticing skilled workers to come to our country so we can become competitive. Tax reform will be the biggest thing to grow our economy and create jobs and opportunity across our district and our country and I have a hand in crafting this bill.

We held:  - 5 live, in person town hall meetings - a live television town hall from WPDE on Facebook live - a live radio town hall on WRNN - civic club meetings - community leadership meetings - chamber of commerce meetings; and - individual meetings with constituents  Thank you to all who took time to come out to visit with us. I met Mr. & Mrs. Johnson who are a few months into their new marriage, he is 86 and she is 80 and both love and serve the Lord. I caught up with Rick and Daisy of Florence who attended an event in Darlington to share ways their community is using local resources, programs, and the police department to keep youth out of trouble and benefit veterans and widows of veterans.  As I was going around to each event, one thing made me particularly proud. It seems that everywhere we went, someone stood up to thank us for the effort of someone from our district office who had helped them break down a bureaucratic wall at some federal agency. Whether it was Social Security, or the IRS, or the VA, we helped in some way to make their life better, and in one instance we actually helped save their life. Scott Allen came to my Pee Dee office looking for help with his VA healthcare after they turned him away and said there was nothing they could do to help him get a liver transplant. He has a young son in high school and as he said, giving up was not an option. I'm overjoyed to announce that he has had the transplant and is back in good health.   As always, I learned a lot. Obviously we don't all agree on every issue. But we have much more in common than that which separates us.  In the last two years I held 48 town hall meetings. That makes me the 14th highest member out of 535 representatives and senators. I work hard to be available to you. We will make another tour in a few months. In the meantime you can keep up with us here, or call our offices, or go to our website and sign up for our newsletter. My office and I are here for you.  I love our district.

It should go without saying that your congressman is against ILLEGAL immigration. Sadly, that is not the case for many of our Democrat congressman and senators. I wholly support President Trump's plan to SIMPLY ENFORCE THE LAW.    Forget illegal immigration for a moment. We already have, far and away, the most liberal LEGAL immigration system in the world. Our law allows 1,100,000 LEGAL immigrants per year.    Most countries use use their immigration system to make themselves more competitive by allowing people to emigrate if they have a skill set that the country needs.    Our immigration system is completely backward.  2/3 of our legal immigration is based on family relationship. Therefore we import many uneducated people with low skill sets. The result is that most of our LEGAL immigrants end up on welfare, food stamps, social security, etc. This adds to our deficit, strains our already fragile safety net and makes us less, not more competitive.  I have prepared and am currently getting cosponsors for a bill that will correct this glaring problem by changing our immigration system from one that is primarily relationship based, to one that is skill based. It also imposes a federal requirement that employers verify the immigration status of their employees, just like South Carolina employers are currently required to do.  If you take away the carrot of a job, I believe you will more effectively reduce illegal immigration than if you build a wall.","link","http://ireader.olivesoftware.com/Olive/iReader/SunNewsPress/SharedArticle.ashx?document=TSN%5C2017%5C04%5C30&article=Ar02002","ireader.olivesoftware.com",72,55,8,1,0,2,1,3

It promised to make financial systems safer and more fair, but instead big banks have gotten bigger and community banks are closing at the rate of 1 per day.

Big banks are now thriving and everyone else is “too small to stand a chance.” In fact, community banks are closing at the rate of one per day since Dodd-Frank went into place.   Access to capital has always been an advantage that America has enjoyed and is one of the reasons our country has been so successful. But if there are fewer small banks, there are fewer small businesses and that’s a problem because small businesses employ 75% of people. When we shut down the small banks, we shut down our economy.    I voted today in favor of the Financial Choice Act that would repeal parts of Dodd-Frank and offer relief from its smothering regulations. The Choice Act releases the choke hold that Dodd-Frank has put on our main street lenders and opens opportunities for the small business industry.","video","https://www.facebook.com/reptomrice/videos/1398098860280183/",NA,38,15,8,1,0,2,2,6

Our great country would not exist today if our revolutionary heroes did not have the courage and vision to establish a government for the people, by the people.  On July 4, 1776, after much deliberation and negotiation, Congress reached an agreement and our Declaration of Independence from the British Empire became official—the United States of America was born!  Today, Congress goes through a similar process when creating new laws. Ideas are proposed, written, and negotiated before they are voted on by the House and Senate, and signed into law by the President. Admittedly, this process seems frustrating at times, but even in times of frustration we must recognize that our system of government was established to protect the interests of the people and to ensure it would always remain a democracy.   It is now our responsibility as Americans to protect our government and freedoms. We must ensure that the separation of powers, Declaration of Independence, and our country’s laws are upheld and honored. While our country has hit some roadblocks and setbacks since its inception, we still remain the freedom leaders of the world and the greatest nation on earth.  As your representative, I will continue working to ensure that our country remains a beacon of freedom, hope, and prosperity. May God Bless you and may God Bless the U.S.A.!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/reptomrice/photos/a.403408313082581.96379.403403083083104/1420384874718248/?type=3",NA,27,1,4,1,0,0,0,0

He said something that really summed up our time working together: ""Everyday someone is going to come into your office and say something cannot be done. If you accept that you are a failure."" I agree and that's why together we have worked to invest in our local infrastructure, including many projects like: -Beach renourishment -I-73 permit -Charleston Harbor Deepening Project and maintenance of the Charleston Port  -Bucksport Marina -Georgetown Port -Carolina Bays Parkway permit -Highway 31 extension permit  We owe a great debt to BG Turner and his team and I sincerely thank them for helping us advance these projects. I also want to thank Mayors Hatley, Childs, Rhodes, John Pedersen, Brad Dean and everyone at the Myrtle Beach Chamber who helped put the day's events together.

Right now, the neediest Medicaid recipients in the poorest states are being penalized because the wealthier states have been able to receive the lion’s share of federal Medicaid funds.   As this article states, eligibility for Medicaid has been loosened, resulting in enormous disparities. For example, in 2015, Connecticut received $12,240 in federal Medicaid funds per resident under the poverty line, while Alabama was able to claim only $4,070.  The way the federal funding is administered now means Medicaid residents in states like South Carolina are at a disadvantage just because of where they live. We need to get to a place of equity so that Medicaid can be fairly administered and restored to its original intent: helping the poorest, most needy among us.","link","http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/07/14/medicaid-inequality-fix-000474","politico.com",47,59,16,0,1,4,1,13

The expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare just increased the number of people covered; it had nothing to do with per capita federal spending caps.   The way the federal Medicaid funding works now is for every dollar a state puts in, the federal government contributes $1-$3. Wealthier states are able to front more money, therefore, (despite the funding formula) get more federal dollars and states like South Carolina are left at a disadvantage. As seen below in Medicaid spending per full-benefit enrollee, our state is dead last at 50th.","link","http://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/medicaid-spending-per-full-benefit-enrollee/?currentTimeframe=0&selectedRows=%7B%22states%22%3A%7B%22all%22%3A%7B%7D%7D%2C%22wrapups%22%3A%7B%22united-states%22%3A%7B%7D%7D%7D&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22%3A%22Total%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%22desc%22%7D","kff.org",42,45,12,1,0,0,2,1

Sometimes we agreed and other times we didn't. Regardless, I truly enjoyed meeting and hearing from everyone despite our differences in viewpoints.   One thing I have to say after today's events is that I believe that our country is divinely inspired. You may not agree, but I firmly believe that.   Although our Founding Fathers were flawed, just as we all are, they created a country based on the premise that all men are created equal. To believe that one group or person is greater than another is abhorrent to the founding principles of this country.  This country is based on that principle and rooted in compromise. Because of these things, our country is now the greatest, most prosperous nation in the history of the world. Regardless of our differences everyone I heard from pretty much agreed on one thing: we have got to get back to putting country over party in order to get things done.   Friends, I'm working hard on the federal level and the local level to uplift everyone in the Grand Strand and the Pee Dee and promise I will continue to do so.   Thanks to all who took the time to voice their concerns and meet with me. It's an honor to serve you.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/reptomrice/photos/a.561911750565569.1073741836.403403083083104/1470072239749511/?type=3",NA,37,10,2,0,0,0,0,1

Our current tax code puts American businesses at a disadvantage and that translates to the loss of millions of middle class American jobs. If we really want to grow the middle class, give them a raise, reduce income inequality, and stop jobs from leaving our shores, we must make our tax code competitive in the world. That has got to be our number one goal and this plan helps get us there.","link","https://fairandsimple.gop/?utm_source=RepTomRice","fairandsimple.gop",9,7,0,1,0,0,0,0

It promises that with hard work and determination you can improve your station in life, and that your children have the opportunity for a better life than yours. But for many in the generation coming of age in the last decade, the American dream has been a little tarnished and just out of reach.  The last time we did tax reform was 30 years ago. At that time, we were the world’s uncontested economic leader. Our economic system and tax code were competitive. But for decades we have sat idly as the world restructured to pass us by.  As we became less competitive, more and more American companies and American jobs left our shores.  And what has been the result?  We've lost millions of middle class jobs.  In 1990, the middle class was comprised of about 50% of American families. Today, it is only 40%.  Even worse, the middle class today makes just about the same take-home pay as it did in 1990.    When we all worry about income disparity and the gulf between the rich and the poor in this country, this is the source of the problem.  The American middle class is smaller and has not had a raise in 30 years!!!  How could this happen?  It has everything to do with a bloated, over regulating and overtaxing federal government – a government that sucks the life out of the economy and forces our companies, our innovators, our job creators out of our country to survive.  Some folks say that it doesn't matter that we have the highest business tax rate in the world.  That's not why our companies left. They say those jobs aren't coming back.   Well, I say, the outdated tax code is an anchor around the neck of our businesses, innovators, and middle class. I say, the American worker can compete with anyone on a level playing field, if we can just get government off their back.  Since January, Congress has been working with President Trump to correct that. We have made dramatic steps in reducing regulation. You are already seeing the economic lift.   Today, we passed a tax cut, which will restore economic growth, put more take home pay into the pockets of hard working Americans, and restore opportunity for a generation of Americans.  It will bring American jobs back to America.   It will grow our middle class. And finally, after 30 years of stagnation, it will give our middle class the pay raise it deserves!!!","link","https://fairandsimple.gop/","fairandsimple.gop",92,98,6,9,1,1,1,33

I was a tax lawyer and a CPA before I went to Congress. Tax Reform was one of my main goals. As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, and with my background, I played a big role in drafting the tax reform bill.  Now Nancy Pelosi and CNN would have you believe that this bill would be a disaster for our economy.  But I say, don’t listen to the fake news bluster.  You don’t have to be a tax lawyer to understand that if America has the highest business tax rate in the world, that companies, and jobs will go elsewhere!  Now comes this article, from the New York Times no less, saying that China is worried.  It seems that after we’ve made our tax code competitive, the Chinese think companies will be moving manufacturing back to the USA!  Guess what?  I think the Chinese should be worried!  And that is great news for our economy.  Friends, I hope you have a great New Year.   Thank you so much for your trust in me.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/business/tax-bill-china.html","nytimes.com",270,115,35,20,5,2,2,56
