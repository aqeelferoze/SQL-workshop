The confirmation of DeVos, a longtime advocate of school vouchers, means that the leader of the federal agency responsible for ensuring the education of every child will now be advocating for taking money away from public education and creating a more unequal system than we already have. When you combine that background with her complete lack of personal experience in American public education, this represents reckless negligence on the part of the Trump Administration and her Senate supporters.   It is telling that Vice President Pence’s tiebreaking vote is the first time a vice president has had to resolve a tie on a cabinet nomination in the nation’s history.

Since the White House was informed by the Acting Attorney General weeks ago about Flynn’s engagement with the Russians, it is fair to question whether he would have been forced to step down if not for the public outcry over his conduct.  As one of President Trump’s closest and longest-tenured advisors, Flynn’s resignation over covert discussions with the Russian ambassador to the United States raises serious questions about who directed his actions and who knew what he was doing. With a lack of transparency from the new Administration, this may just be the tip of the iceberg.  A thorough and impartial investigation is needed to determine just how deep the Russian government and its interests are embedded within the Trump Administration.    Flynn’s resignation also reminds the American people of the many questionable personnel decisions President Trump has made.  His Press Secretary began his time in the press room with a series of obvious falsehoods.  His White House Counselor has peddled Ivanka Trump’s merchandise from the White House.  The man President Trump wants in the White House Situation Room for every major national security decision is a known white nationalist.

I also want to thank Clean Ocean Action for their advocacy in the moving this project forward.   The proposed maintenance dredging would involve the removal of approximately 350,000 cubic yards of gravel and sand to be placed at the SBOBA, which is located approximately 1 nautical mile east of Sandy Hook and has been used as a material source for beach nourishments since 1994. Clean Ocean Action has been an advocate for placing clean, dredged material from the channel in the SBOBA, since it will help alleviate the need to use natural sand formations as supplies of sand in the future.

Now, he is pursuing unprecedented police action that will create fear and anxiety throughout our country, rip families apart and pit law enforcement and local governments against the communities they serve.   Whereas President Obama followed a policy of pursuing undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes, President Trump intends to escalate the situation by removing even those who have not been convicted of any criminal offense. His orders call for ICE, CBP, and local police to apprehend first and ask questions later, a call for racial profiling that flies in the face of civil liberties guaranteed in this country.  Rather than working towards real solutions to address the reality that 11 million undocumented immigrants are currently living in the U.S., President Trump is focused on building an unnecessary and impractical wall that Mexico will never pay for. These actions are deeply troubling, costly, and will leave our country worse off in the end.  Meanwhile, President Trump continues to act hastily without consulting law enforcement professionals and by turning away members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus from a meeting with ICE last week.

His budget proposal puts the military industrial complex above the best interests of global peace and security, and above the best interests of the American people.    “The President has disparaged our military in order to justify a massive military buildup. Our nation already has the best military in the world, led by our courageous and talented men and women in uniform. Increasing military spending by more than $50 billion comes at the cost of cuts to the State Department’s peaceful diplomatic efforts and vital programs that assist working families. Not to mention, the President’s intention to pursue enhanced military operations – and his track record for acting before considering the consequences – would put more American lives in danger and make the world less secure.  “The Environmental Protection Agency – which is responsible for ensuring clean air, safe drinking water, and cleanup of polluted lands – would also face massive cuts.  This should come as no surprise considering Trump’s EPA Administrator nominee, Scott Pruitt, has made a career of attacking the agency he now runs.  It should, however, come at great concern to the American people, who need to have confidence that the agency responsible for protecting public health is doing its job.  “Budgets are about more than dollars and cents—they are statements of our values as a nation.  Failing to invest in peaceful diplomacy, our public health, environment, infrastructure, public education and the arts will simply cost our country more in the long run. We should be working together to grow our economy, not playing politics with the budget process by misleading the American people.”","status",NA,NA,154,27,34,5,0,0,2,5

The President’s budget is focused squarely on a major buildup of our military.  This despite the fact that we have what is undeniably the most respected military in the world, and that we already spend more on defense than the next seven highest spending countries combined.  The President’s has a track record of acting before considering the consequences, but he needs to reconsider this proposal which could lead to an arms race.  The President hasn’t made clear how he’ll pay for his military expansion, but the math won’t add up without devastating cuts to agencies and programs that promote global peace and security, protect public health and the environment. The President has already said he plans to gut the EPA, which will mean less protection against polluted water, air, and land.   The President also continued to stoke irrational fear of and anger towards immigrant communities.This country is at its greatest when we leverage the unique talents and abilities that each of us brings to the table, not when we alienate those who don’t look, pray, or sound like us.  If the President is serious about unleashing unprecedented economic growth, he should start by acknowledging that fact.  My guest tonight, Jon Whiten from Highland Park, NJ, has a son with type 1 diabetes.  Prior to the Affordable Care Act, Jon’s son could have been denied or faced a lifetime cap on coverage that would have resulted in huge out of pocket costs, inferior healthcare, or both.  If President Trump is successful in repealing the Affordable Care Act, we’d go back to the old days and Jon’s son and millions of other Americans would suffer devastating consequences.   Our country deserves better leadership than that.  I was disappointed with the President’s address and I do not share his vision of an America consumed by darkness or for  our country’s future.  I will continue to stand up for my constituents and the values they sent me to Washington to represent and if President Trump continues to pursue his divisive and dangerous agenda I will continue to oppose it vigorously.","status",NA,NA,225,76,31,7,0,0,2,18

According to media reports, when questioned about the source of funding for the Reach NJ ad campaign, the Christie Administration provided a copy of a 2014 contract totaling $1.5 million with marketing agency Princeton Partners.  That contract, however, was intended to support a public awareness campaign to increase enrollment in WIC, and it used federal dollars.    Republican elected officials across the nation frequently attempt to weaken social safety net programs such as SNAP and WIC. Congressman Pallone has consistently fought against such cuts, and most recently fought successfully to prevent a more than 8% cut to domestic discretionary spending, which includes WIC, last year.    “I fight hard in Congress to protect programs that provide vital support to those most in need. It is deeply concerning that the Governor appears to have taken funds intended to increase awareness and participation in a program that provides nutrition to mothers and infants, and instead is using the funds for another ad campaign in which he has the starring role. We constantly hear Republicans decrying waste and fraud in government programs, and it seems like in the funding of this ad campaign, we may have found it.”  “I have been a leader in Congress to provide funds for opioid treatment and research, and will continue to do so. However, we cannot stand for funds intended for the WIC program to be covertly redirected to an unrelated ad campaign.”  In 2014, Congressman Pallone was a leader in calling on the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to investigate the Christie Administration’s decision to use Hurricane Sandy aid for an expensive advertising campaign produced by a politically connected firm.","link","http://pallone.house.gov/press-release/pallone-calls-investigation-christie-misuse-federal-funds","pallone.house.gov",139,23,23,4,0,1,2,7

Before passage of the ACA, insurance companies could refuse to sell Michelle a plan or could charge her whatever they wanted in premiums to simply make insurance unaffordable. Today she is back on her feet, working and contributing to the American economy.  Protecting people like Michelle by ensuring access to quality health care when they need it most is what the ACA has always been about. Repealing the law would undo the progress we’ve fought so hard to make and put Americans' health back in the hands of insurance companies.

Despite warnings from independent experts like CBO and others, Republicans continue to recklessly jam this bill through Congress without so much as a single hearing on what effects their plan will have on middle-class families. This report also reaffirms that the Republican plan does absolutely nothing to control costs or protect consumers. Instead, it guts Medicaid, raises costs on older Americans, and pulls billions of dollars from Medicare, all in order to pay for tax cuts for the rich.  “This is a major step backwards for millions of Americans who now enjoy the benefits and protections of quality health insurance gained under the Affordable Care Act. We strongly urge Republicans to back off their politically-motivated march to sabotage our health care system and instead work with Democrats to strengthen it.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepFrankPallone/photos/a.10150540590377732.389695.6517277731/10154674720242732/?type=3",NA,68,19,31,1,0,2,10,24

I know firsthand that their traditions and culture lend so much vibrancy to all of our communities. As thousands in New Jersey brave the cold to head out to their favorite St. Patrick’s Day Parade this month, it is clearer than ever that this holiday is truly a symbol of the success of Irish-Americans in the nation.   For many in America of Irish ancestry, including thousands in my congressional district, St. Patrick’s Day is an opportunity to celebrate and honor the 35 million Americans who trace their heritage to Ireland. Those who immigrated to the United States from Ireland often faced great obstacles to achieve the American dream, but their determination and contributions undoubtingly make our country stronger.   The Irish-American experience is a reminder of the role that immigration has played in our nation’s story and it should inform our opinions as we debate our immigration policy today.   Ireland continues to be a beacon of democracy and prosperity in Europe and it is essential that the United States stands with its ally as we confront the 21st century. Brexit will undoubtedly bring about challenges for the emerald isle, but it should be made clear that Americans will stand with it during this uncertain time.  It is my hope that the U.S.-Irish relationship is not one just celebrated on St. Patrick’s Day, but one that we work to expand and build upon for many years ahead.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepFrankPallone/photos/a.10150540590377732.389695.6517277731/10154687025732732/?type=3",NA,48,5,3,0,0,0,0,0

It abandons meaningful progress on climate, and our role as a global leader in developing the clean energy technologies and jobs of the future.  The President’s action breaks our commitments to nearly 200 nations within the Paris Agreement to address the global problem that we helped to create.      Today’s action jeopardizes our economic and environmental future.  It is a hastily assembled Executive Order that undermines the Climate Action Plan, and directs the federal government to disregard the mounting costs of carbon pollution.  The President’s action attempts to reverse the Clean Power Plan, which is the result of a transparent, multi-year public outreach process.  Thankfully, these landmark climate initiatives cannot be recklessly overturned by a pro-pollution, fossil fuel dependent Executive Order developed behind closed-doors for special interests.

For decades, there was bipartisan agreement to invest in our nation’s infrastructure, and it is time to return to that. I agree with the President’s call for $1 trillion in infrastructure investments. Real dollars going toward real infrastructure investments will lessen commute times, improve transportation safety, allow businesses to move their products more efficiently, and create millions of jobs for Americans workers. These investments can also increase connectivity through broadband, rebuild our schools, modernize our water infrastructure, and so much more.  Superstorm Sandy tragically, but importantly, drew attention to flaws in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). After paying steep premiums for their policies, many New Jerseyans were victims of fraud or denied adequate compensation in the wake of Sandy. I have been engaged in bipartisan efforts to reform the NFIP, such as increasing transparency of NFIP, capping flood insurance profits, providing funds for flood mitigation efforts, and creating a more efficient and transparent claims review process.","link","http://www.app.com/story/opinion/columnists/2017/04/13/divisions-america-polls-washington/100423280/","app.com",12,5,1,0,0,0,0,0

The numerous reported voting irregularities also suggests that this narrow victory for the consolidation of executive power lacks legitimacy and does not represent the will of the Turkish people. With most of the free world viewing the results in Turkey with skepticism and concern, it is unfathomable that President Trump called to congratulate President Erdogan. The United States should work to preserve democratic institutions in Turkey and around the world, not serve as a rubber stamp for strong handed tactics that moves Turkey farther away from a free, fair and open government.","status",NA,NA,137,24,12,3,0,3,21,1

Flynn has received more than $500,000 for lobbying for Turkish individuals linked to the Erdoğan regime and failed to disclose these payments, as is required by law.   Recent news reports allege that Flynn asked the Obama administration to delay the Pentagon’s plan to retake the Islamic State’s stronghold of Raqqa with Kurdish forces. Turkey has long been opposed to the United States partnering with Syrian Kurds.  Given President Erdoğan’s egregious human rights record, exemplified by the recent brutality at the Turkish Embassy, it is disturbing that Michael Flynn lobbied on behalf of Turkish citizens linked to the Erdoğan regimeIt is even more troublesome that he failed to disclose his actions and that he may have compromised our efforts to defeat ISIS in order to please his former client. With Mr. Flynn’s willingness to conceal relationships with foreign powers, we must investigate if there are other interactions that have yet to be revealed.  It must also be asked how the Trump administration could possibly ignore the fact that Mr. Flynn was under investigation, when they were repeatedly warned that he was under investigation – including by Flynn himself. There is no more serious crime then when a public servant puts another nation’s interests above the United States’ and I will work to ensure that the numerous ongoing investigations into the Trump administration pursue Michael Flynn’s potentially treasonous relationship with Turkey.","status",NA,NA,104,14,13,3,0,0,0,0

In 2012, Sandy caused widespread issues related to the availability of gasoline. In response to help build a more secure and resilient energy infrastructure, the Energy Department, with the encouragement of Congressman Pallone, established the first federal regional refined petroleum product reserve containing gasoline. The Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve would assist New Jersey, New York and other states in the Northeast during an emergency.  “President Trump may have forgotten the devastation that Sandy brought to New Jersey, but my constituents and I have not. Access to gasoline was severely limited in the aftermath of the storm, causing major problems in the region impacting homeowners, businesses and emergency personnel.  We learned hard lessons from this experience and put in place a plan to make the region more resilient when another storm strikes. With many New Jerseyans still rebuilding, it is stunningly shortsighted for President Trump to abandon a measure that can save our economy and even save lives in an emergency.”","status",NA,NA,63,7,11,2,0,0,0,9

The bill protects policyholders from skyrocketing premiums and reauthorizes the NFIP for six years, while also reforming current practices. Those reforms include: improved flood mapping, greater affordability, and increased oversight of the program.   Superstorm Sandy devastated many communities in my district. In the wake of the storm, too many of my constituents found that, after responsibly paying for their flood insurance, their policy failed to provide the coverage they needed and deserved when they needed it the most. Many were prevented from repairing their homes and resuming their lives by a claims review process that moved too slowly and was riddled with fraud. As this was happening and people were suffering, the flood insurance companies made record profits.  The SAFE NFIP Act takes concrete steps to make the program more affordable, increase oversight and transparency of the flood insurance companies, invest in mitigation efforts, and reform the claims process using lessons learned from Sandy. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to fight for this bill and our constituents.","link","http://pallone.house.gov/press-release/pallone-and-pascrell-introduce-bipartisan-flood-insurance-reform-bill-house","pallone.house.gov",46,5,6,0,0,0,0,0

We have been demanding from FEMA for years that they recognize the urgency of the situation faced by the victims of Sandy, and the need to expeditiously complete the claims review process and get the funds owed to these homeowners.

Earlier this year, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed to gut net neutrality protections.      At its most basic level, net neutrality means that we, the people, can decide for ourselves what we do online. We decide which videos we watch, which sites we read, and which services we use. Nobody gets to influence that choice: Not the government, and not the companies that run the networks. That’s how the internet in the US has always operated, and that’s how it should be.

I will do everything with my power to fight the Trump administration’s decision.   Earlier this year, I was inspired by thousands of New Jerseryans who came out to support Carimer Andujar.

Now, over 22,000 young adults in New Jersey like her will once again face the terrifying possibility of deportation.

It is a cover for Republicans to give huge tax cuts to millionaires, billionaires, and multinational corporations at the expense of the rest of us.  The GOP tax plan would also make it harder for working people across New Jersey – many of my constituents would see their average tax burden increase by more than $16,000.  This is primarily because their plan eliminates the tax deduction for state and local income and property taxes.   “To achieve this backwards-thinking tax philosophy, the Republican budget would gut investments in education, infrastructure, innovation, clean energy, job training, medical research, and health care – including cutting Medicaid by $1.1 trillion and Medicare by $487 billion.  It is irresponsible and shameful, which is why I voted against its passage.   “There is a better way forward.  One that invests in the American people and commits to their future.  One that prioritizes good jobs, great education, world-leading research, affordable and accessible healthcare, and our climate.  I was proud to vote for budget alternatives that prioritize those efforts, and I will continue to work every day to advance them, even as many of my Republican colleagues remain dead-set on rolling back progress and padding the pockets of their rich friends.”","status",NA,NA,57,28,14,3,0,2,2,2

The plague of gun violence in our communities is completely unacceptable. As Members of Congress, it is not enough to ask for a moment of silence. It is not enough to express our thoughts and prayers. It is not enough to call for action, we must enact change. We are far beyond the point as lawmakers and as Americans at which we must answer a basic question: Can we stand up to special interests and enact the sensible, bipartisan gun reforms that a majority of Americans want and can save lives?

The bill would make flood insurance more expensive, less accessible, and less fair for millions of Americans.   Just a few weeks ago, we observed the 5th anniversary of Superstorm Sandy. New Jersey’s recovery from that traumatic event has been prolonged, in part, by issues facing the National Flood Insurance Program. Too many of my constituents are still dealing with high premiums, inaccurate flood maps, or are still waiting for their Sandy claims appeals to be decided. We need a long-term NFIP reauthorization that focuses on increasing affordability, investing in mitigation, capping the profits of the flood insurance companies, and comprehensively restructuring the claims process. This bill fails that test.  Rep. Pascrell and I offered amendments that would have improved the bill. They included a 10% cap on premium increases, increasing the Increased Cost of Compliance from $30,000 to $100,000, capping the profits of flood insurance companies, and other pro-policyholder provisions. The Republican majority refused to bring the amendments to the House floor for a vote.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepFrankPallone/videos/10155389815687732/",NA,79,14,9,0,0,0,3,1

As a father, my heart broke for the young children, educators and families that lost so much in that senseless tragedy.  Since that moment I have said again and again that as Members of Congress it is not enough to ask for a moment of silence. It is not enough to express our thoughts and prayers. We must enact change.   Unfortunately too many elected officials have failed to honor the victims of Sandy Hook with action. They have let the NRA and the gun lobby dictate our responses to tragedies like Sandy Hook, instead of the victims and the urgent need to address the gun violence epidemic in our country. Like many Americans, I have been appalled as Republicans have pursued legislation to make it easier for mass shootings to happen in recent months, even after the massacres that took place in Texas and Las Vegas.   Today, I hope that all Americans will say a prayer and remember those who lost their lives at Sandy Hook Elementary. But that is not enough. We need to make it clear that we need to ban high capacity magazines and assault weapons. We must also have universal background checks for all gun sales and close loopholes that have allowed criminals and the mentally ill to purchase guns. We need to do everything within our power to help prevent another shooting like Sandy Hook.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepFrankPallone/photos/a.10151968407517732.1073741833.6517277731/10155481230412732/?type=3",NA,62,39,18,9,0,0,56,3

Republicans have hinted that they will use new deficits created by the Tax Scam to justify significant cuts to Medicare & Social Security.  Seniors have paid into and earned their Social Security and Medicare benefits. They should not face drastic cuts because Republicans want to slash tax rates for large corporations and the wealthiest of Americans.","link","https://pallone.house.gov/press-release/pallone-discusses-devastating-impact-gop-tax-scam-seniors","pallone.house.gov",48,29,17,0,3,0,6,9

Instead of focusing on real threats like climate change the strategy calls for building an impractical and unnecessary border wall. Instead of holding Russia accountable for its interference in our election, Trump continues antagonizing our strongest allies. As LGBT communities throughout the world are threatened, this administration continues to pass the buck on human rights.   The United States must lead by standing up for democracy, tolerance and human rights. President Trump is simply failing to do so by anemically staffing our State Department and foiling diplomatic efforts at every turn.","status",NA,NA,69,38,5,0,5,0,2,11

Studies have found that 86 million middle class households will see their taxes go up. Meanwhile 83% of the tax cut will go to the top 1% wealthiest Americans. New Jersey will be hit especially hard because the bill limits state and local tax deductions. This will lead to higher tax bills and lower property values. And since it adds $1.5 trillion to the deficit Republicans are already talking about cutting essential programs like Medicare to make up the difference.   I want to hear from you. How do you think the GOP tax plan will affect you and your family? Please leave your views in the comments.","status",NA,NA,64,101,20,1,0,2,12,35
