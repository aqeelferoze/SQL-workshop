That was the exact reason for my listening session in Lawrence on Monday. But, as the Lawrence Journal World’s latest editorial about me accurately points out, I represent more than just the several hundred vocal constituents that attended my recent town hall. While many of them supported countervailing opinions, I still have a responsibility to represent the Second District at large.     The 25 counties in that district are very diverse ideologically. That means voting directly against the preferences of some Kansans every single day, but that does not mean I am not listening. I was elected to office with about 60% of the vote on average by running, in part, on the promise to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a patient-centered solution to our healthcare system. I intend to keep my word.   While this bill is far from perfect, I think the foundation of the American Health Care Act – the first of our 3 step process – is a step in the right direction. I believe it will be amended and improved upon before it becomes law.    As for other parts of the Lawrence Journal World editorial, I could not disagree more. While the sub-headline of this editorial calls for more honesty, honesty should be a two way street.   What the editorial failed to mention is that I took the stage of the Dole Institute around 3:25pm, roughly 10 minutes after the Congressional Budget Office released their report, and fewer than that by the time I received it. I was in the car and there was no way for me to completely review this report in a couple minutes before heading on stage. I knew only the bare basics.    But now that I have had the time to review the CBO’s score, I noticed that the editorial omitted several key facts. They failed to mention that the CBO stated the American Health Care Act will lower premiums by 10 percent. They failed to mention that the CBO stated the American Health Care Act will reduced the federal deficit by $337 billion. They failed to mention that the CBO stated the American Health Care Act will lower taxes by $883 billion. They failed to mention that the CBO stated the American Health Care Act will increase choices for consumers – especially important since insurers, like Humana, are leaving Obamacare’s insurance exchanges. They failed to mention that the primary reason why fewer people will be covered as currently drafted, is because the new bill makes it legal to choose to be insured or to not be insured. And, yes, they failed to mention that the CBO is fallible as was proven out by their coverage projections for Obamacare   As I said earlier, this bill is far from perfect and is a work in progress. I represent 25 counties in Kansas’ 2nd Congressional District, filled with many different views. These listening tours are a way for me to connect with those I represent and ensure their voices are heard in Congress. I appreciate everyone for joining my listening sessions and telephone town halls along the way, I will be sure to update you as this bill moves through Congress.","link","http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2017/mar/15/editorial-few-surprises-town-hall/?opinion","2.ljworld.com",111,104,16,10,0,3,1,21

According to media reports, only one-third of counties in the United States have one insurer in the Obamacare marketplace. Kansans deserve a better healthcare system, one that is patient-centered and creates competition to drive down the high cost of medical needs.   To that end, I have been working with my House colleagues to create a much more affordable healthcare system. While the American Health Care Act is not perfect, it is another step in offering Kansans more choices and freedoms by repealing penalizing taxes and regulations – encouraging insurers to stay in their respective markets and enter new markets.    As for those with pre-existing conditions, the AHCA specifically states, that it will not limit access to coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions. Thus, legally, insurance companies cannot deny folks coverage based on pre-existing conditions.    Most importantly, in states who do not seek a waiver, health insurers will not be allowed to charge higher premiums due to pre-existing conditions. In states that ask for and receive a waiver, folks who have been continuously covered for one year, and do not go without coverage for more than 63 days, will not be charged higher premiums due to their preexisting conditions. The bottom-line is that if you stay covered, you cannot be charged more under the law.    The current healthcare system is not working – as noted by the countless Kansans who have called, emailed, written and met with me since Obamacare went online in 2013. While this legislation is a start, it is far from reaching the President’s desk, and in the coming weeks, I will continue to listen to your thoughts regarding this important issue and share them with my colleagues to ensure they are heard in Congress.  Items to Note:  - House Republicans included an extra $8 billion dedicated to lowering premiums or other out-of-pocket expenses on top of the $130 billion available to states through the AHCA’s Patient and State Stability Fund.  - In Kansas, the AHCA will close the coverage gap for the 50,000 folks just above Medicaid eligibility who did not receive tax subsidies. - Once the American Health Care Act is fully implemented in 2020, premiums will begin to decrease – allowing families and individuals to save money. - Lastly, the American Health Care Act includes Congresswoman Jenkins’ language, from the Restoring Access to Medication Act, to allow individuals and families to use the funds in their Health Savings Account and Flexible Spending Account to purchase over-the-counter medications.","status",NA,NA,234,622,73,14,5,3,24,344

One that lowers rates for individuals and families so they save time and money doing their taxes and keep more of their hard-earned money. A tax code that helps jumpstart our economy and creates more opportunities for all Americans.  While some may try to compare this tax reform framework to what was tried in Kansas, the truth is these two reforms could not be more different. Under our framework, everyone pays a lower rate. In terms of pass-through businesses, Congress will lower the rate to 25%, not 0%. Our approach will actually lessen the tax avoidance and simultaneously bring American companies firmly in line with our global competitors.  There is a lot of information to digest in our tax reform framework, and I would recommend everyone read it for themselves.

The analysis and most of the facts are based on a 2016 analysis on a proposal from then candidate Trump. Our tax reform framework came out last month. As in September of 2017. The principles in it were agreed to by House and Senate leadership and the White House, but the KC Star is good with running with the plan circa fall 2016. Makes sense. Further, this editorial makes it seem that Congress is only cutting the top corporate and individual rates. Which is simply untrue and never has been. Just the other day, Speaker Ryan stated that we are keeping a 4th bracket to ensure our highest-income earners don’t get a rate cut. But you won’t find that in this column because, you know, why use information from last week when you have that trusty analysis from 2016.

This tax reform legislation shares our goals of ensuring that rates are cut for lower and middle income Americans, simplifying the tax system, and expanding American competition within the global economy.  However, now that this bill has been released, I would encourage everyone to read it before falsely stating this tax reform legislation is the same thing as the 2012 Kansas tax cut package. While Kansas took the pass-through rate to 0%, we are dropping the rate to 25% along with implementing strong safeguards to prevent the type of tax avoidance that was possible in the Kansas plan. Specifically, this tax plan only allows a pass-through business to claim 30% of their income at the lower 25% rate, and the other 70% of their income remains at the top individual tax rate. Further, it calls for pass-through entities that are considered ‘services businesses’ to be taxed at the higher income rate level, because their income is considered wages.    Lastly, it is important to state that this is not the final version of the tax reform bill. This introduction starts the legislative process as the Ways and Means Committee will meet next week to debate the bill and then send it to the House floor for full debate. In the meantime, I encourage everyone to read the legislation and contact my office with your thoughts so I can best represent you in Congress.","link","https://jenkins.house.gov/press-releases/house-republicans-introduce-tax-reform-legislation/","jenkins.house.gov",116,153,25,3,7,3,2,54

The moratorium has been extended numerous times in recent years covering all prior years since the regulation was put into place.
