His achievements as President are too numerous to list but three are significant: over 15 million jobs created since the end of the Great Recession, 20 million more Americans with health care and a $1 trillion reduction in the deficit.   President Obama was a strong fighter for the middle class and the vulnerable. Our nation and state are in a stronger position today than when President Obama took the oath of office in January 2009.

NAFTA has adversely impacted middle class families in Pennsylvania and the TPP would have cost jobs and hurt income growth, which is why I voted against fast tracking the deal in 2015.  During the debate over TPP I met with workers in Braddock, Pennsylvania to hear about how these bad trade deals have impacted their lives. In Braddock, the population declined approximately 82% from 1960 through 2010, in part because of economic policies that rig the system against workers. The stories I heard from those workers are borne out by the facts: from 1993 through 2002, 525,094 workers were certified as displaced by trade by the Department of Labor and from 1993 through 2010 our trade deficit with Mexico increased by $66 billion. A 2014 study in the Review of Economics and Statistics by four economists concluded that ‚Äúoccupation switching due to trade led to real wage losses of 12 to 17 percentage points between 1984 and 2002.‚Äù Finally, 8 of 11 countries in the TPP have minimum wages lower than the U.S. and 7 having minimum wages below $3/hour, it would be unfair to force Pennsylvania workers to compete for those jobs. Our workers deserve a fair shot instead of an uneven playing field.  Any renegotiation of NAFTA must include strong enforceable environmental and labor standards; when businesses can exploit workers in Mexico, it is not only an affront to their rights, but places U.S. workers at a significant disadvantage. When it comes to free trade deals, Pennsylvania often gets the short end of the economic stick and It‚Äôs time for that to change. I call on Congressional Republicans, who have supported these agreements over many years, to work with President Trump and those of us who have long opposed these bad trade deals in order to finally level the playing field for our workers.","status",NA,NA,432,104,59,15,0,0,3,41

This radical approach will also harm rural Pennsylvanians by ending coverage and threatening to shutter rural hospitals. Some of these communities only have one hospital and the cuts that would occur with block granting would cripple those hospitals. In addition to the loss of health care services, block granting Medicaid will cause substantial job loss for middle class families, large numbers of whom work at hospitals. Block granting Medicaid is just a cute phrase for $1 trillion in cuts that will result in less nursing home care for seniors and less health care coverage for the struggling and those with disabilities.

Rolling back rules for the same Wall Street banks whose reckless behavior crashed the economy and cost millions of middle class families in Pennsylvania and across the nation their jobs and life's savings during the Great Recession is wrong and dangerous. By delaying a requirement that workers and savers receive investment advice that is in their best interest, this executive order will also adversely impact seniors who will now have less protections when seeking investment advice.   Big banks are posting record profits, they and those at the very top don't need help, but Pennsylvanians in Luzerne, Erie, Beaver and Cambria counties need good paying jobs that support their families.

President Trump promised to pursue a substantial investment in our infrastructure- not only has he failed to put forth a plan but this budget cuts infrastructure programs that have created jobs in Western Pennsylvania by repairing aging locks and dams. President Trump campaigned on helping urban communities, but students in Philadelphia will be adversely impacted by the elimination of after school programs. Southeastern Pennsylvania is at the forefront of the kind medical research that drives cures while creating jobs, yet this budget decimates the National Institutes of Health (NIH) which funds that research.    This budget would eliminate the Community Development Block Grant Program, which communities across Pennsylvania, particularly rural ones, use to invest in job-creating projects. This plan would eliminate the Rural Water and Wastewater Loan Program, which is the only way that some rural communities in Pennsylvania have access to clean water. This budget would also eliminate the Essential Air Services Program, meaning that airports in Johnstown and Northwestern Pennsylvania could be shuttered.

Despite weeks of secretive deliberations, the Senate Republican bill is nearly identical to the House bill that raises premiums for middle class families, cuts nursing home care for seniors and will force children with disabilities to be institutionalized. The bill decimates Medicaid, which provides health care for over 722,000 Pennsylvanians with a disability and 1.1 million children. This scheme still includes an age tax on Americans between the ages of 50-64, undermines protections for those with preexisting conditions and takes away coverage for substance abuse treatment, which is vital in combatting the opioid epidemic. This legislation will cripple our efforts to battle opioid addiction in our country, deepening this public health crisis.   This scheme will also devastate rural hospitals in Pennsylvania, forcing workers to lose their jobs and communities to lose their only hospitals.    The Senate Republican bill is a tax giveaway to the wealthiest Americans; the top one tenth of the one percent would receive thousands upon thousands of annual tax cuts while some individuals with disabilities lose coverage. That is obscene. Further, this legislative scheme that will take away health care for millions of Americans is being supported by a bunch of Senate Republicans whose health care coverage is guaranteed by the taxpayer. America is better than that; we can take care of vulnerable Americans and still have a growing economy for the middle class and keep our country safe.","link","https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/SENATEHEALTHCARE.pdf","budget.senate.gov",570,268,425,6,9,14,166,412

Our armed forces and the U.S. government have made some progress, but Afghanistan has a long fight ahead to gain the sustainable stability and security its people want. The United States and our allies have a continued interest in preventing Afghanistan from being used as a safe haven or operational base from which terrorist groups like al Qaeda, the Haqqani Network, and ISIS can execute attacks that threaten our national security.    The President‚Äôs proposal deserves a thorough review. I appreciate that it appears to have been developed on the basis of counsel from our military leadership, but I am concerned that such a significant decision was made at a time when the State Department lacks Senate-confirmed leaders in many critical senior roles. Any continued military operations in Afghanistan must be accompanied by a comprehensive diplomatic and development strategy, including to ensure that the country is ready for Parliamentary elections scheduled for July 2018 and to maintain and grow the health, education, and human rights gains that have been made thus far. For example, I have led an effort to invest in recruiting and retaining women in the Afghan National Security Forces and we must ensure the Afghan government builds on those gains.   Afghanistan‚Äôs future must be decided by the Afghan people, not the United States military -- the Afghan government, especially the Afghan National Security Forces, must continue to develop the capability and willingness to take responsibility for their own country‚Äôs security. Countries in the region, especially Pakistan, also need to continue to fight terrorism and work with the Afghan government to improve regional stability and security.   I urge the President to engage Congress in a bipartisan, bicameral effort to draft and enact a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force, or AUMF, that will govern the ongoing deployment of U.S. military forces to combat terrorism.  The truth is that the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and our role in them, have evolved significantly since the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs were enacted. As we call on our servicemembers for another deployment, more months away from their families, we owe it to them to have this debate, no matter how hard it may be to come to agreement.","status",NA,NA,1309,438,132,97,6,2,19,63

In 1894, Labor Day first became a national holiday; at that time workers had few protections in the workplace and their voices were often drowned out. Many of our families, including mine, saw up-close how difficult it was for workers who descended into the depths and darkness of our state‚Äôs coal mines. Those workers, their struggles and sacrifices,  are a source of inspiration for all of us today.  And we need that inspiration.  While there‚Äôs no doubt we have made substantial progress for workers since that first national holiday, we have much more work to do. We have a lot of work to do to raise wages and create good-paying jobs that can support a family. Too many of our nation‚Äôs retired coal miners, including many in Pennsylvania, are being denied the pensions they worked all their lives for and still more struggle to receive the black lung benefits they need. Too many workers are denied their right to organize and work in a safe environment. And too many families lack basic protections like paid and sick leave.  On this Labor Day, we remember the work of the past but recommit ourselves to the work of today- the job of making sure our workers have a level playing field and receive a fair shot. When we level the playing field by fixing bad trade deals, holding cheaters like China accountable and investing in our infrastructure then we will begin the work of rebuilding the middle class.  And even as we mark this holiday, our thoughts and prayers are with those in Texas and Louisiana who are dealing with the aftermath Hurricane Harvey.","status",NA,NA,868,98,87,82,3,0,1,4

Tearing apart the lives of these young people will make our nation less safe, and harm our economy. According to the CATO Institute, deporting Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients would cost more than $60 billion and would result in a $280 billion reduction in economic growth over the next decade.  The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates that the 1.3 million young people enrolled in or eligible for DACA pay $2 billion each year in state and local taxes.   It‚Äôs clear that Republicans in Washington and the Trump Administration are not serious about fixing the problem of illegal immigration, securing our border and reforming our immigration system. Instead, their only plan is to deport 11 million individuals, including 790,000 Dreamers. Congress should move immediately to pass the bipartisan Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, which would allow the Dreamers to become permanent residents if they meet the very stringent qualifications outlined in the bill.","status",NA,NA,5092,1541,1055,524,47,22,609,260

When I think of those we lost on 9/11 and the first responders who worked so hard in the aftermath of the attacks, I‚Äôm reminded of two words: valor and courage. From New York City to the Pentagon and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the valor and courage of so many Americans was on display that day and in the ones that would come after. Those acts of valor and courage continue to inspire us to defeat those who invoke terror on the world.  When I think of the obligations that those of us in public office have to all those who were impacted on 9/11, I‚Äôm reminded of something my father said to a group of soldiers before they left for the Gulf War. He said, ‚ÄòWe pray for the military families and for their loved ones serving around the globe; we also pray that we may be worthy of their valor.‚Äô  So today and every day, we must hope and pray that we are worthy of your valor.","status",NA,NA,810,68,59,89,0,1,54,3

Congressional Republicans should scrap this obscene plan and start over with a bipartisan process that raises incomes for the middle class and creates jobs.","link","https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-stick-with-big-corporate-tax-cuts-in-house-bill-1509629510","wsj.com",276,320,198,5,9,8,50,350

Congress should be working in a bipartisan way to make our tax system simpler and fairer, but the Senate Republican plan does just the opposite. In 2019, the country‚Äôs 572,000 richest households will see $34 billion worth of tax cuts, while the 90 million Americans making under $50,000 a year will see a fraction of that. That is both obscene and grossly unfair.   The bill rewards companies who outsourced jobs by giving them a big tax cut and may actually encourage more outsourcing in the future. What‚Äôs worse is that this tax plan will trigger $25 billion in automatic cuts to Medicare unless Congress acts. Now, after creating a huge hole in the deficit by giving tax cuts to the super-rich, top Republicans are saying they are planning to go after Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Adding insult to injury, the bill also includes a partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which will result in 13 million Americans losing their health care while premiums increase for families across Pennsylvania by an additional 10% per year. That‚Äôs wrong and I will fight against it.    The Republican tax plan that just passed the Senate rewards companies who outsource jobs and ends tax deductions that help the middle class.

The middle class is getting the short end of the stick while the super-rich and big corporations get a windfall. Instead of reauthorizing the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which has now expired, or investing in infrastructure like our roads and bridges to create jobs, congressional Republicans have passed a tax plan that gives over $36 billion dollars in 2019 to the country‚Äôs richest 572,000 households ‚Äì those making over $1 million a year. The 90 million American households making under $50,000 a year will only see a fraction of that. By 2027, the Republican tax plan gives 83% of the cuts to the top 1%. To make matters worse, the GOP tax plan creates an incentive to offshore jobs.   This whole scheme is a gut punch to the middle class. And now, Republicans in the House and the Senate are saying their next step is to go after Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. I will not stand by as Republicans in Washington plot to cut these vital programs for the middle class, especially after they passed into law these tax giveaways for big corporations and the super-rich.","status",NA,NA,1767,1137,636,28,97,17,469,971
