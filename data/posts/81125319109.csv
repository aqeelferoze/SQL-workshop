At such times as these, emotions run high.  The good news is that our institutions are the best ever designed to resolve such political disputes.  In other countries, the government is the sovereign and rights flow from it to the people.  In America, the people are sovereign.  But in America, the sovereign doesn’t govern.  It hires help to govern during an election.  In-between elections, the sovereign people debate how the hired help is doing.  That’s the real debate: the one that goes on every day wherever Americans gather.  And after that family discussion, we decide whether to fire the hired help or keep it for another cycle.  As long as we are talking with each other and not shouting at each other, our system works well.

The FCC promulgated a rule that requires the ISP to give you a choice of whether you want this information shared with third parties.  This resolution rescinds that rule.  This is a fundamental privacy issue.  You have a choice in subscribing to search or social sites – if you don’t agree with Google’s privacy policy, you can use some other service whose terms you find more pleasing.  Agreements with such companies are purely a matter of choice, with which government should not interfere.  But the ISP’s are different.

Now that the administration is making progress on restoring border security, it is time for Congress to address this issue.  Reform should incorporate two fundamental policies:       First, the reform must include measures to restore complete integrity to our legal immigration system.  This includes full funding for construction of the border wall, mandatory use of e-verify for employment with strengthened penalties to employers who violate federal employment law, strengthening penalties for those illegally entering or staying in the country, strong sanctions against local and state sanctuary jurisdictions and implementation of entry/exit monitoring of visa stays.       Second, DACA must not be made a permanent and open-ended policy, or we will encourage more parents to illegally bring their children to the United States.  DACA should be ended immediately.  Those currently enrolled in the program should be granted legal residency if they have no criminal convictions in their background, if they are not affiliated with criminal gangs and if they have not previously been subject to a deportation order.

Two of the principal objectives I have set as Chairman of the House Federal Lands Sub-committee are to restore public access to the public lands and to restore the federal government as a good neighbor to those communities directly impacted by the public lands.  The proposed fee increases run counter to both of these policies.   At a time when we are trying to encourage more Americans to visit and value our national parks, more than doubling entrance fees is certain to have a significant impact on park visits and the commerce they bring to our gateway communities.   I understand the Department’s concerns over revenues, and our sub-committee stands ready to assure that revenues generated in our parks through visitations and attendant commerce stay in our parks.  This is the central principle of my HR 3607, affecting park health clinic funding.  Meanwhile, the House Natural Resources Committee is seeking to prioritize Land and Water Conservation Funds away from excessive land acquisition and toward addressing the Park Service’s growing maintenance backlog.     These steps would assure that funds will be available to address maintenance issues without undermining the very purpose of our national parks: to welcome the American people to the lands set aside for their “use, resort, and recreation,” as promised in the original Yosemite Charter of 1864.  https://mcclintock.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/statement-on-national-park-fee-increase-proposal","link","https://mcclintock.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/statement-on-national-park-fee-increase-proposal","mcclintock.house.gov",273,294,42,22,1,3,1,20

Full statement on the vote:  H.R. 1 – House Tax Reform Bill: NO   I am convinced that the business side of this bill will produce dramatic growth for the national economy.  However, I believe the personal income tax side does significant harm, particularly to many families in high-cost, high-tax states like California.     This was entirely avoidable, if higher priority had been given to family tax relief than was given to tax simplification.  The current major deductions for such expenses as mortgage interest, state and local income taxes, medical and casualty expenses and student loan interest could all have been retained in the bill, while still providing a significant, across-the-board reduction in all tax rates, assuring that no taxpayer was left behind.   Unfortunately, the amendment that I offered to do so failed, and despite many discussions, I have yet to receive assurances that the final bill will protect every taxpayer against tax increases.      I favor a flat tax, but families make the most important financial decisions in their lives based in part – sometimes in large part -- on the tax deductions available to them.  Transitioning to a flat tax requires a very gradual phase-out of deductions over a long period of time to prevent trapping taxpayers in a bait-and-switch world where deductions they had counted on suddenly disappear.  This bill ignores that necessity.   This is particularly harmful to Californians who suffer under policies that have grossly inflated the cost of housing.  Even though the mortgage interest deduction is grandfathered for existing mortgages, the limitation will make home ownership less affordable for future home buyers and devalue the asset for current homeowners.  Yes, that will cause home prices to decline, but for all the wrong reasons.   The state and local tax deduction is removed under this bill, further disproportionately affecting Californians.  The rationale is that taxpayers in low-tax states subsidize the high spending in liberal states.  But this ignores a central tenet of federalism: that governments closest to the people should make most of the decisions and provide most of the services, and thus have first call on tax revenues – the federal government is supposed to get in line behind them.  The bill turns this principle on its head and amounts to a double-taxation of every dollar government claims from family earnings.    Other provisions permanently eliminate personal tax exemptions, replacing them with a personal tax credit.  Unfortunately, the credit goes away in five years, meaning that many families seeing a tax cut this year may end up paying higher taxes in future years.  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that nearly one fifth of families earning between $75,000 and $100,000 will see an average $500 annual tax increase by 2027.   It is claimed that the average taxpayer will see their taxes reduced.  This invokes the mystery of the 6-foot man who drowned in a pond whose average depth was 5-feet.  It is undeniable that a significant portion of taxpayers will see an increase in their taxes, particularly in California, and particularly over time as the temporary relief provisions phase out.   Nor are the personal income tax provisions likely to produce much economic growth.  Productivity occurs at the marginal rate – how much your next dollar is taxed.  By leaving the top marginal tax at 39.6 percent – and indeed, creating a new bubble bracket of 46 percent -- the economic advantages are severely limited.    Congress has refused to cut spending, and spending drives both debt and taxes. Economic growth is the only other way to address our approaching debt crisis.  Increasing the debt to produce growth is only justifiable if the tax reform maximizes growth potential.  The personal income tax provisions fall short.   These infirmities might still be justifiable in exchange for the positive economic impact of the business tax provisions in the bill.  Tragically, though, they are unnecessary and could easily have been fixed in a manner that guaranteed no taxpayer is made worse off.     Proponents argue this is a work in progress and the bill can be improved in conference.  I hope that is the case and eagerly await it.  Unfortunately, the House must decide the merits of the bill before it today – not what might come to it in the future.  It is rare for the conference process to improve bills, and a commitment to provide taxpayer protections in the final version has not been forthcoming.  In this case, the Hippocratic oath makes for good legislative advice: “First, do no harm.”  Particularly for California, this bill fails that test.  https://mcclintock.house.gov/newsroom/vote-notes/hr-1-house-tax-reform-bill-no","status",NA,NA,284,294,59,20,2,5,2,29

This bill addresses a nagging problem at Yosemite National Park involving a medical clinic that has operated in the Valley since 1929. Like other medical clinics in our national parks, it serves the park and concessionaire employees, their families, and tens of thousands of daily park visitors.    The Yosemite Medical Clinic is a million-dollar-a-year operation, maintaining a full-time staff and sophisticated medical equipment to treat and stabilize any number of serious injuries and sudden illnesses that confront a population of a moderately sized town.    But here is the problem.  Any other medical clinic would be able to use the fees it collects to finance its operations; to plan for amortizing equipment purchases and expansions, and to match its expenses to the revenues it generates.  Not so our park medical clinics.  Under current law, the fees collected by the medical clinic must go directly to the national treasury, and the park must then rely on annual appropriations to replace those funds – with no certainty they will return and no ability to plan long-term improvements.  This bill changes that.  It would establish a separate trust fund in the Treasury -- still under the control of Congress -- but dedicated to be returned to the clinics that generate these funds in the first place.    https://mcclintock.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/hr-3607-yosemite-medical-clinic-passes-house-natural-resources-committee","link","https://mcclintock.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/hr-3607-yosemite-medical-clinic-passes-house-natural-resources-committee","mcclintock.house.gov",124,51,9,6,1,0,0,0

H.R. 1349 would restore the original intent of the Wilderness Act to allow bicycles in wilderness areas. People who enjoy mountain biking have just as much right to use the public trails as those who enjoy hiking or riding, and our wilderness areas were never intended by Congress to prohibit mountain bikes.  A year after he signed the Wilderness Act of 1964, Lyndon Johnson said, “The forgotten outdoorsmen of today are those who like to walk, hike, ride horseback or bicycle.  For them we must have trails as well as highways.”    Bicycles were allowed in wilderness areas from the inception of the Act in 1964 until 1977, when the forest service reinterpreted the act to ban them.  This met with a stern rebuke from Senator Frank Church, one of the key sponsors of the wilderness act, who protested that “the agencies are applying provisions of the Wilderness Act too strictly and misconstruing the intent of Congress as to how these areas should be managed.”  In 1980, Congress explicitly listed bicycling as a permissible use when it established the Rattlesnake Wilderness in Montana, and the Forest Service then rewrote its regulation to allow bicycles unless the local forest manager banned them.    Many scientific studies have concluded that mountain bikes cause no more environmental wear and tear than hiking or horseback riding.  A 1994 study by Wilson and Seney at Montana State University found that tires caused less erosion than hiking and horseback riding.  A study at the University of Tasmania, Australia made similar findings.  Trails maintenance is significantly hampered by the current ban on wheelbarrows – H.R. 1349 specifically allows them.  https://mcclintock.house.gov/newsroom/speeches/hr-1349-restoring-the-original-intent-of-the-wilderness-act-to-allow-bicycles-in","link","https://mcclintock.house.gov/newsroom/speeches/hr-1349-restoring-the-original-intent-of-the-wilderness-act-to-allow-bicycles-in","mcclintock.house.gov",233,152,52,14,2,0,5,32

The bill restores the original intent of the Wilderness Act to allow bicycles, adaptive cycles, strollers and game-carts in wilderness areas at the discretion of local land managers.  Bicycles were originally permitted in wilderness areas from the time Congress enacted the Wilderness Act until 1977 when federal bureaucrats began adopting blanket prohibitions against their use.  The bill would restore to federal land managers the option to permit non-motorized mountain bikes, adaptive cycles, strollers and game-carts in Wilderness areas where their use is compatible with the environment, trail conditions and existing uses.  The measure is supported by the Sustainable Trails Coalition and was adopted by a vote of 22-18.  It now goes to the House floor.  https://mcclintock.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/hr-1349-restoring-the-original-intent-of-the-wilderness-act-to-allow","link","https://mcclintock.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/hr-1349-restoring-the-original-intent-of-the-wilderness-act-to-allow","mcclintock.house.gov",137,122,36,10,0,0,1,32

It increased the marginal tax rate on high income earners and abolished life-line deductions such as casualty loss, medical expenses and student interest.  I urged that we should leave no taxpayer behind.  I want to thank Chairman Brady, the Republican Leadership and the conference committee for heeding these concerns.  Their final product exceeds my expectations, and on behalf of California taxpayers I can now offer my enthusiastic support.  The new version leaves the casualty loss, medical expense and student interest deductions intact.  No family needs to fear being ruined by taxes after a major declared disaster or illness, and graduates can continue to plan their lives knowing interest on their student loans will not be taxed.  The new bill eases the proposed limit on mortgage interest deductions and allows up to $10,000 of state and local taxes to be deducted – all important improvements for Californians.  Most importantly, the lower tax rates in this bill now more than compensate in almost every case for the remaining limits on state and local tax and mortgage interest deductions.  Even taxpayers who lose tens of thousands of dollars of deductions will still pay lower taxes than they do today.  For example, a couple earning $60,000 with a $300,000 home and three adult dependents would have paid $200 more in taxes under the old bill – but under the new version they will SAVE $340.  A couple earning $150,000 with a $750,000 home and one child would have paid $1,200 of additional taxes under the old House bill.  In the new bill, that same family will SAVE $720.     The business tax provisions are especially important, because they will restore American workers to an internationally competitive position.  According to economists ranging from Martin Feldstein to Arthur Laffer, these provisions alone will produce $5 trillion of new economic activity over the next decade – that’s $40,000 per household -- including $2 trillion of new tax revenues to all levels of government.  Last Friday I toured AMPAC, a local company making the active ingredient in several cancer and epilepsy drugs.  Their product is then shipped to Ireland to make the actual medicine because the corporate tax in the United States is 35 percent and in Ireland it’s just 12 ½ percent.  Their CEO, Aslam Malik, told me that if they gave their product away for free, the final medicine could still not be competitively manufactured in the United States – solely because of our taxes.  He expects their local company will grow dramatically because of this tax reform – employing hundreds more families both directly and indirectly as they expand everything from payroll to infrastructure.  That’s what the Marxists just don’t understand.  Businesses don’t pay business taxes.  Businesses collect business taxes from just three sources: from consumers through higher prices; from employees through lower wages, and from investors through lower earnings – usually pension plans and IRAs.  We have the highest corporate tax in the industrialized world, and commerce and capital simply move around it – leaving our workers behind.  That’s one of the reasons why we averaged 1 ½ percent economic growth under Obama – worse than any President since Herbert Hoover – and lost an entire decade of prosperity.  The Marxists tell us that this is just trickle-down economics and it has never worked.  In fact, it has ALWAYS worked.  It worked when Warren Harding did it in the 1920’s; when John F. Kennedy did it in the 1960’s, when Ronald Reagan did it in the 1980’s and lest we forget, when Bill Clinton approved the biggest capital gains tax cut in American history.    Concerns over the deficit are legitimate and must be addressed by spending reforms this coming year.  We must always remember that both taxes and debt are driven by spending.      The proof of these policies will manifest itself over the coming year – and every American will be able to decide for themselves if this has made them better off.  That’s probably why the left has pulled out all the stops to defeat it.  Their arguments are the same economically illiterate attacks filled with class-envy that they made against Reagan.  When the American people awakened one day to find it was morning again in America, the left was discredited for a generation.    Let history repeat itself beginning today, with this vote.    https://mcclintock.house.gov/newsroom/speeches/morning-again-in-america","status",NA,NA,230,479,71,32,2,0,7,183
