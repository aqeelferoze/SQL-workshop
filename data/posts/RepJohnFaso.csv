I wanted to take some time to briefly clarify the process undertaken by Congress today.  Today’s vote was on a stripped-down budget resolution for Fiscal Year 2017. This initial vote opens up the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as “Obamacare,” for much-needed reforms and possible repeal. Today’s vote does not repeal the ACA. Today’s vote will not kick anyone off their chosen insurance plan. Today’s vote does not limit Medicare or Medicaid options. The vote today was the start of a process to fix the health insurance system, repeal what doesn’t work, and reform the system so more people aren’t priced out of the market.  Since it was enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act has failed to live up to its own promises. Without fundamental reform it will crumble under its own weight. Today’s procedural vote opens up the process to real reform after more than six years of failed attempts to make the ACA work. Americans were told that premiums under the ACA would fall by $2,500. Yet for 2017 alone, premiums will increase for New Yorkers an average of 16.6% for individual plans and 8.3% for small-group plans. Individuals nationwide have received cancellation notices from insurance companies, lost doctors that they liked, and have been forced to purchase unaffordable plans that contain unneeded or unwanted mandatory coverage provisions. The current framework of the ACA has failed to lower costs, and will continue to make healthcare less affordable.  The next step in the process is known as “reconciliation.” A total of four Congressional committees, two in the House and two in the Senate, will now review the Affordable Care Act over the coming weeks. These four committees will draft a reconciliation bill – which is sent to the Budget Committee on which I sit. This legislation will likely repeal certain portions of the Affordable Care Act and will set up a stable transition to patient-centered reforms. Once both the House and Senate pass this legislation – expected in February – it will go to the President for his signature. Next, the House and Senate will get to work on enacting reforms to the healthcare insurance system which will likely allow purchase of insurance across state lines, return much regulatory authority back to the states where it has traditionally resided, while at the same time making sure that ACA provisions guaranteeing purchase of insurance for those with pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parents’ plan until age 26 are continued. At the same time, the Department of Health and Human Services will be taking actions to stabilize insurance markets and allow insurers to design health plans which are flexible to meet needs, particularly for small groups. Since most people receive their insurance through their employers, such reforms are critical.  Let me be clear: Reform and replacement of the ACA will take place over the next few years and only after full congressional debate and public input. I will fight to keep the portions of the ACA that are working, and will dedicate myself to fixing the portions of the law which are not. My main focus during this multiphase process will be working toward guaranteeing access to consistent, stable, and affordable healthcare for all Americans.","status",NA,NA,36,154,25,0,0,0,6,31

Given recent events both here and abroad, we need to take steps to strengthen our nation’s security; however, this is most effectively pursued through thoughtful and deliberative legislation. While I acknowledge that the president may act in the event of a national security threat or emergency situation, this process was rushed and led to confusion. There is no doubt that we need to thoroughly vet people coming from countries where there are strongholds of ISIS and al-Qaida. At the same time, we have to balance our security with the need to respect the rights of US citizens and people who are subject to valid immigration proceedings, including lawful permanent residents.","link","http://faso.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=55","faso.house.gov",297,174,80,0,1,0,0,11

Suspending the tax for 2016 and 2017 sales is expected to save manufacturers $3.4 billion in tax payments, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Unfortunately, this tax is scheduled to go back into effect in 2018. It will cost medical innovators $29 billion nationwide over 10 years, damage job creation and reduce economic growth. This tax is unnecessary and the costs will ultimately be passed on to those who need these devices most.","link","http://faso.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=56","faso.house.gov",22,40,2,0,0,0,0,5

These reforms are critical to reduce costs for small businesses which provide health insurance to their employees and also to assist insurers in offering more affordable choices to those in the individual insurance market.

The purpose of this committee vote was straightforward: to assess whether the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees had fulfilled the requirements laid out in the 2017 budget resolution the House debated and passed on January 13. In my opinion, and in the opinion of a majority of committee members, they had. The Budget Committee cannot amend the legislation under the rules of reconciliation; the committee merely determines whether it complied with the rules. A ‘no’ vote would have cut off discussion rather than advance positive changes to the underlying bill for the families and small businesses of the 19th District.  The American Health Care Act now heads to a fourth committee and, likely, the floor of the House for a full vote. During this time I will continue to carefully review the legislation and gather input from constituents, providers, and insurers about how this reform plan will affect them. I will remain focused on keeping what works in the original Affordable Care Act while offering improvements to fix what has failed too many of our fellow Americans. Given these circumstances, simply doing nothing is neither practical nor responsible.  http://faso.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=193","link","http://faso.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=193","faso.house.gov",25,326,17,2,1,0,1,126

From the start of this process, I have stated that the responsible path forward includes keeping what works and fixing what doesn’t. The ACA as it stands now will collapse under its own weight if nothing is done, imperiling millions of Americans through higher premiums and fewer choices. These are the facts:  Currently one third of US counties have only one insurer.  Premiums rose an average of 25 percent this year for those on the exchanges.  Deductibles will average more than $6,000 this year for those in the lowest-priced ACA plans.  4.7 million Americans were kicked off their plans by the ACA.  The ACA raised taxes by $1 trillion, including new payroll taxes for employers, business investments, and taxes on over-the-counter drugs and medical device manufacturers.  18 out of 23 ACA co-ops have failed, including Health Republic in New York State, costing taxpayers billions of dollars.  20 million Americans are without health insurance under the ACA.  Acknowledging the ACA’s failures, the people’s representatives were faced with a choice: do nothing and watch millions of our citizens continue to be forced to buy insurance they cannot afford, or work together to improve a broken system. Unfortunately, Democrats offered not a single alternative. They simply obstructed any changes to the ACA. I believe the American Health Care Act (AHCA) as amended addresses the concerns I have heard from residents, businesses, providers and insurers.  The AHCA will continue to protect Essential Health Benefits (EHB) and those with pre-existing conditions. Children up to 26 years old can continue to stay on their parents’ healthcare plans. In addition, New York insurance law requires health insurance plans to include Essential Health Benefits and also includes provisions for guaranteed issue of health insurance. This remains unchanged under the AHCA.  Approximately 7 percent of the insured nationwide are in the individual market. Essential Health Benefits only cover those in the individual and small group markets under current ACA law. Those who receive health insurance from employers with over 50 employees have never been affected by ACA provisions relating to Essential Health Benefits. This too is unchanged under the AHCA. The limited waiver provision would only affect those in the individual market and would not affect New Yorkers. That’s because New York State law already contains these consumer protections and, as such, our state would not be able to seek this waiver in any event.  The AHCA contains a provision I authored to eliminate the ability of New York State as of 2020 to impose Medicaid costs on county property taxpayers. For a typical homeowner or commercial property owner residing in the 19th District, Medicaid costs represent over 40 percent of their county property tax burden. New York’s Medicaid spending dwarfs that of most other states. For instance, New York spends more than Texas and Florida combined, even though these states have more than double our population. The provision I authored will bring much-needed property tax relief and keep people and jobs in Upstate New York.  http://faso.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=301","link","http://faso.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=301","faso.house.gov",151,1891,89,10,2,3,41,834

The US never ratified the Kyoto agreement yet our nation reduced CO2 emissions beyond those called for in that agreement due to the responsiveness of our market-based economy. Regardless of who is in the White House, I believe the US must continue to work to lower greenhouse gas emissions while balancing the needs of our economy.

Key to these changes are:  Trains 230, 233, 235, 236, 239, and 242 will operate service out of Grand Central Station as opposed to their usual destination or departure site of Penn Station. Grand Central Station is located about a mile north of Penn Station, and local transportation such as bus lines and subways can be used to transfer.
