There can be no mistake: Obamacare was on the ballot in November, and the voters said they wanted a change.

The monstrosity of a health care law failed the American people by throwing them off their preferred plans, eliminating access to their favorite doctors, and sending premiums and deductibles through the roof.  In fact, the average premium in Pennsylvania increased by 32 percent this year, and in some corners premiums rose as much as 53 percent.  That level of cost increase is unsustainable.   I remain as committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare as I was on the day I came to Congress.  We must find an alternative that allows consumers to choose their plans, drives down costs, and ensures that Americans’ hard-earned tax dollars are properly distributed only to American citizens.    Unfortunately, after evaluating the text of the American Health Care Act, I cannot support the bill in its current form.  I am concerned that the bill lacks sufficient safeguards for verifying whether or not an individual applying for health care tax credits is lawfully in this country and eligible to receive them.  Under Obamacare, a half a million people received a total of $750 million in health care subsidies, even though the recipients could not prove their lawful presence in the United States.  I cannot vote for a replacement plan that fails to address this problem.  I came to Congress to stop illegal immigration.  I would have a hard time explaining to families in the 11th District – many of whom are still struggling to put food on the table and foot the costs of their own health care bills – why they should be helping to pay for the health expenses of someone who broke the law to get here and has no right to those federal dollars.  The repeal and replacement of Obamacare will be a multi-phase process, but until my concerns are met, I cannot at this point support the bill.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanLouBarletta/photos/a.198894583454694.55707.192357174108435/1529544043723068/?type=3",NA,85,113,24,2,0,0,1,12

This disaster of a health care law threw people off their preferred plans, eliminated access to their favorite doctors, and on average, increased Pennsylvanians’ premiums by 32 percent. This afternoon, I voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. The AHCA is not the final product, but rather a starting point for a better health care plan that will drive down costs, restore choice, continue protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions so that they cannot be denied coverage, and ensure that Americans’ hard-earned tax dollars go only to American citizens. I also voted for a bill that blocks members of Congress and their staff from receiving any special health care benefits. Sticking the American people with Obamacare was simply not an option, and today we took a necessary step to repair that damage.","link","http://barletta.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/barletta-votes-to-repeal-and-replace-obamacare","barletta.house.gov",486,302,84,45,1,1,3,152

Here's how:  Under the AHCA, nobody will be charged higher premiums if they keep up their health insurance coverage, and nobody can be denied coverage based on a health condition.  Additionally, the bill maintains that individuals cannot be discriminated against in the insurance market based on gender.    Obamacare applied a one-size-fits-all mandate on individuals and states, which forced insurers out of the marketplace and left individuals with and without pre-existing conditions either uncovered or with significant premiums and out of pocket costs. The AHCA, by contrast, allows for competition and for market forces to lower premiums.    While the AHCA allows states to apply for waivers to opt-out of certain Obamacare regulations, the state must first show how the waiver would serve to either reduce premiums, increase enrollment, stabilize the insurance market, increase consumer choice, or stabilize premiums for individuals with pre-existing conditions. Any state that receives a waiver will receive additional funding to support programs, such as high-risk pools, that cover costs for individuals with pre-existing conditions. If an individual in a state which receives a waiver does not maintain continuous coverage and experiences a higher premium as a result, protections will kick-in to ensure that the individual's rate lowers after a year. The bill was further amended to include an additional $8 billion specifically to bring down premiums and out-of-pocket costs for individuals with high health insurance costs in a state that receives a waiver.","status",NA,NA,200,427,126,10,1,1,5,142

Unlike previous approaches, President Trump made clear that his administration’s strategy will be dictated by our nation’s top military experts and the conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables set by politicians in Washington.  As President Trump stated, and as history has proven true, ‘Micromanagement in Washington does not win battles.’   For far too long, we have put our troops at a disadvantage with overly restrictive rules of engagement and by telegraphing our military plans to the world.  The former administration made bad deal after bad deal, sending billions of dollars to countries that provided safe havens for terrorists while doing nothing to hold them accountable.  That will not continue under this administration.   We are finally going to rely on the guidance of our military leadership and redefine victory in realistic terms.  Our goals are clear: facilitate stability and security in the region so that terrorists cannot threaten the United States.  We are killing terrorists, not building nations.  Afghanistan’s future will be determined by the Afghan people.   While President Trump is committed to carrying out this mission in partnership with countries in the region, particularly Pakistan and India, he is demanding that they step up and contribute their fair share.  This is a strategy that puts America’s interests first and will advance the fight against terrorist organizations that threaten our interests both at home and abroad.","status",NA,NA,319,72,17,35,2,0,0,26

When President Obama illegally granted amnesty to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants, he improperly created more competition for American workers and legal immigrants who are already finding it difficult to get work.  American citizens, or people who have come to the United States legally, should not have to suffer from others butting in line after they have broken the law to enter this country.  Today, by putting such decisions back in the hands of Congress, President Trump is putting America first and making it clear that no president has the authority to create immigration law.  America is a proud nation of hard-working citizens and legal immigrants.  Today’s announcement is a victory for the forgotten American worker and legal immigrants who followed the rule of law to become part of our nation.  Too often in the debate about illegal immigration, the media and politicians focus on the person who came to this country illegally. No one talks about the American worker and legal immigrant whose wages are depressed and jobs are threatened by illegal immigration.  I am proud to stand with those hard-working individuals and their families.  On this issue, I have been clear:  We cannot have a conversation about those who are in our country illegally before we stop the flow of illegal immigration.  We are dealing with this problem today because Congress has failed to enforce our laws and secure our borders.  By putting the debate our fixing our broken immigration system into the hands of Congress, where it belongs, President Trump is giving the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate the chance to put the forgotten American first.  The American people deserve to know that their government is serious about defending their security and protecting their jobs. Our country cannot afford for Congress to fail on this issue again.","status",NA,NA,917,399,140,92,3,1,10,213

A simpler and fairer tax code will bring back money and jobs from overseas.

Pennsylvanians have seen skyrocketing costs, less choices, and degraded quality in their healthcare under Obamacare.   Families should be able to purchase the healthcare plan that best suits their particular needs. Since 2013, Pennsylvanians’ monthly premiums have increased by 120 percent, with deductibles rising by 60 percent. Now, one-third of counties in America have only a single insurer selling on the exchanges in 2017--this may even increase to 50% by 2018.   In March I identified the pre-Obamacare association insurance structure provided by groups like the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau. The best part of this arrangement was the cost for both the Farm Bureau and its membership. Since the rates were set by experience and a common group of people, the prices were affordable.

Trump outlined a new strategy to deal with the ongoing threat posed by Iran by decertifying the Iran nuclear deal. The core strategy, released by the White House early this morning, will focus on neutralizing the Government of Iran’s destabilizing influence and constraining its aggression, particularly its support for terrorism and militants.   President Obama’s deal with the brutal Iranian regime was a big mistake.  The reckless behavior of this regime, as well as the bloodshed caused by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and their proxies around the world, warranted harsh American foreign policy measures to preserve the balance of power.  Instead of tough demands, the Obama Administration determined striking a deal was more important than the merits of the deal’s terms.  This put America and our allies in the region like Israel at risk.  It amounted to total appeasement of Iranian aggression.   The Iranian regime has a notorious history of funding terrorism around the world, as well as providing material aid to the North Korean regime in their development of nuclear weapon technology.  Reports have also pointed to significant Iranian involvement in the Iraq War, leading to the deaths of many American soldiers.   For 28 years, Ali Khamenei has been Iran’s Supreme Leader.  Khamenei and the IRGC have pursued a steady policy of spreading a revolutionary ideology aimed at undermining the international system by force and subversion.  His main enemy and rallying point has been and continues to be the United States of America, which he refers to as the Great Satan.   Under Khamenei, Iran exports violence, destabilizes its neighbors, and sponsors terrorism abroad.  The reckless behavior of the Iranian regime and the IRGC in particular, poses one of the most dangerous threats to the interests of the United States and to regional stability.  The Iranian regime has taken advantage of regional conflicts and instability to aggressively expand its regional influence and threaten its neighbors with little domestic or international cost for its actions.   As a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I know that the threats to the American homeland and our allies are real.  Appeasing terrorism will encourage more terrorism.  I look forward to supporting President Trump as he works with our allies to confront Iranian aggression.","status",NA,NA,195,60,17,15,2,0,2,40

On July 4, 2017 the Shavertown Volunteer Fire Department, along with numerous other units from Back Mountain and West Side, rushed to the scene after receiving a report of a home fire where a victim was trapped inside.  Upon arriving at the scene, crews found two, three story, wood frame structures engulfed by an inferno.    Without concern for their own safety, a mixed crew from Truck 251 and Squad 251 stormed to the second floor of by way of the front stairs and over ground ladders, crashing through windows in a rush to gain access.  Both crews worked together and did a primary search of the second floor apartment. There Firefighter Keith Rinehimer first found the victim in a rear bedroom.    While attempting to remove the victim, Firefighter Rinehimer’s face piece became dislodged and he began to lose breathable air.  Still, Firefighter Rinehimer continued fighting to remove the victim.    At one point before leaving the bedroom, he was forced to remove his gloves to assist in holding onto the victim, receiving minor burns to both hands.  He was then joined by Firefighter Ted Sherrill, who assisted in removing the victim from the bedroom, moving her down a hallway towards the kitchen.   There they were met by Asst. Chief Erik Sowga, Captain David Rinehimer and Firefighter John Berti.  As the flames grew fiercer, it was decided that they would take the victim out by the front stairs instead of the ground ladders. They descended the front stairs amidst heavy smoke and fire conditions, with temperature readings at 800 degrees.    The victim, Lilou Warmouth, was removed from the building and turned over to EMS crews for transport. Firefighter Keith Rinehimer was treated at the scene for burns to both his hands and smoke inhalation, while the others were treated for heat exhaustion.    Incredibly, all five returned to service to continue to fight the fire.    Asst. Chief Erik Sowga, Captain David Rinehimer, Firefighter Keith Rinehimer, Firefighter Ted Sherrill and Firefighter John Berti all went above and beyond the call of duty on the night of July 4, 2017.  They displayed selfless courage and bravery, saving the life of Iilou Warmouth.  Their fearless courage deserved, and received, recognition with the Medal of Valor.  Firefighters and every first responder put their lives on the line daily to protect their fellow citizens.  Right now in California, thousands of firefighters battle infernos threatening towns across the state.  It was recently reported that up to 40 have tragically perished in the line of duty.   It’s incumbent upon us as citizens of this great country to recognize these heroes whenever and wherever we see them. Always remember when you pass your local firehouse, police station, military base or hospital that these are the men and women who will put their lives on the line for you.  They serve and protect innocent lives.  They actively take part in the highest duty of any nation: service.    I hope above all that we come together in fellowship and civic duty as Americans.

I learned long ago as Mayor of Hazleton that D.C. has had zero interest in protecting the jobs of American citizens.

As of October 6, the U.S. House of Representatives reached record productivity. Throughout the first 10 months of the Trump Administration, we passed 362 bills – 49 more than under the previous administration over the same time period.   Although Congress as a whole has passed important measures such as repealing the harmful Stream Buffer Rule which would have put up to 64 percent of America's coal reserves at risk, many other major reforms passed by the House sit untouched in the Senate. While some Senators are working hard to come to the table and figure out how to best move forward for the American people, others want to obstruct President Trump as an individual, leaving our agenda in Congress as collateral damage.  Some should put aside their egos and remember we are here for the American people.   The most glaring example is the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. The House took steps to repeal and replace this harmful and costly law that applies a one-size-fits-all federal bureaucracy to the entire healthcare system. Despite promises of keeping doctors and plans and paying less in healthcare costs, Pennsylvanians saw premiums increase by 32 percent, with numbers as high as 53 percent in some areas. Deductibles soared 60 percent, and today one-third of counties across the US have just one insurer.   By one vote the Senate chose to ignore pleas from the American people suffering from these skyrocketing costs. Instead they focus solely on derailing President Trump rather than working to help their constituents back home. Instead of repealing Obamacare’s micromanagement from DC and replacing it with free market solutions, some Senators are shockingly calling for single payer socialism. And yet, in light of these developments, when we can move to help our constituents, obstruction continues.   Again, not everyone in Congress promotes a policy of obstructionism. However, both sides, House and Senate, must remember who they are working for and join together in support of their agenda. The American people have loudly demanded action, and we should work to deliver results.   Here is a very very short list of other measures that passed the House (and should already be signed by the president) but are stuck in the Senate:  H.R. 3004, Kate's Law: Increases penalties for convicted and deported criminals who reenter the U.S. illegally  H.R. 3003, No Sanctuary for Criminals Act: Permits the federal government to strip sanctuary cities of federal funding if they refuse to cooperate with federal officials on immigration matters   H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act, imposes severe penalties on the murder or attempted murder of local law enforcement  H.R. 26, REINS Act, requires that every new regulation with an economic cost of $100 million be approved by Congress   H.R. 7, No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, which prohibits federal funding from being used for abortion or for payments to insurers for health benefits coverage that includes abortion  H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which prohibits elective abortion after 20 weeks based on scientific findings that a baby can feel pain at that stage of development","status",NA,NA,141,73,23,3,12,0,2,28

In Pennsylvania, according to the IRS, 70.8% use the standard deduction when filing their taxes.  With an average income of $60,000, we give on average $8,919.45 a year to the federal government. Around 13.8% of Pennsylvanians also claim, on average, around $1,257.78 in child tax credits.   The current federal income tax system is too complicated and costly for all Americans. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act streamlines 7 brackets into 4 brackets.  We expand the standard deduction from $6K to $12K for individuals, and $12K to $24K for joint filers--a clear benefit for PA.   Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a family of four, making $59,000, will receive on average a tax cut of $1,182.  That's more money for families to spend how they see fit, for their needs.   The plan also increases the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $1,600--another win for PA families.  To eliminate waste, a social security verification from at least one parent must be provided for receipt of this credit.   These reforms are only part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but I think it shows how we can create a better tax code for ALL American families. Let's let people keep more of their income to spend it how they see fit.","status",NA,NA,125,69,13,0,1,0,1,33

As we gather more information about the attacker, I will continue to push Congress to provide all the resources the administration needs to combat this evil in order to preserve the peace and well-being of our great nation.","link","https://nypost.com/2017/12/11/explosion-reported-at-port-authority-bus-terminal/","nypost.com",110,56,16,5,0,1,5,33

Ninety-one Americans die every single day from an opioid overdose.  In my home state of Pennsylvania, 4,642 drug-related overdose deaths were reported in 2016.  In 2015, there were 5,594 overdose deaths in Appalachia – a drug-related death rate 65% higher than the rest of the nation.  Sixty-nine percent of these deaths were caused by opioids.  An overwhelming majority of these deaths throughout Appalachia were individuals between the ages of 25 and 44, people who were in their prime working years.  These troubling statistics make it clear that the opioid crisis is not only destroying lives, it has created a significant challenge to workforce expansion and economic development throughout Appalachia.  Today, I held a hearing to find a way forward out of the opioid crisis, and into recovery.","link","https://barletta.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/barletta-helps-to-lead-fight-against-opioid-related-employment","barletta.house.gov",48,20,12,3,0,1,4,0

Though the economy stalled, the government did not. The Obama Administration grew government at a record breaking pace.    These numbers and policies are unacceptable. Americans need opportunity to gain prosperity, not rules and restrictions on how we are allowed to succeed.   When an economy revives after a recession, history shows substantial, and rapid, economic growth. But the restrictions and taxes applied to economy after 2008 severely crippled the historic dynamism of the American free market. Wall Street revived while Main Street suffered.  The tax cuts coming through Congress revives Main Street and raises the boats of all American families. Every income group receives a cut. Every income group will see a growth in after tax income of over 3.5%.  Let's take this opportunity to achieve the prosperity America is known for--let's dream big.","link","http://www.nationalreview.com/article/454534/trump-obama-illustrate-presidents-influence-over-economy","nationalreview.com",80,65,9,7,6,1,0,17

Today there are over 185,000 pages. It's no wonder jobs and companies have moved out of America.    The United States taxes and regulates the economy into a competitive disadvantage with the world. I'm very pleased President Trump has made it a point to get faceless, nameless Washington bureaucrats off the backs of Americans who are just trying to achieve the American dream for them and their families.

For a generation, Americans have seen good paying jobs leave our shores and their wages stagnate, while the government continued to take more and more money out of their paychecks.   Washington forgot the American family and worker.  Instead of fighting for Americans, Washington has been fighting to fill the coffers of faceless, nameless bureaucrats.  Today, we made clear to Washington the old way of doing business is over.  This is a new era of American prosperity.    The plan will bring higher wages, create more employment opportunities, and deliver a tax cut to every income group.  This tax plan is a much needed Christmas gift every American family.

This startling statistic highlights the importance of investing in mitigation techniques before catastrophe strikes.    Studies have repeatedly shown that for every $1 invested on the front end, we can save between $4 and $8 on the back end in avoided disaster recovery costs.    My bill, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act, was adopted today and would allow the U.S. to realize those savings by revolutionizing how we approach disaster spending.  We will now place a premium on saving lives and taxpayer dollars by investing in resilient infrastructure on the front end to protect our neighborhoods, schools, religious institutions, and businesses.  This is a big change to how we have approached disasters in America. Investing in infrastructure on the front end is the right approach for the future.  I am very happy my language was adopted today.","link","https://barletta.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/barletta-secures-major-disaster-recovery-reform","barletta.house.gov",41,25,4,3,1,0,0,0

When we return next year, I hope, and expect, the Senators who have stood on a platform of obstruction to return with a new year’s resolution which stands behind the American people.
