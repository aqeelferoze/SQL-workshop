This latest version would gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions, implement an age tax on older Americans, and make the deepest cuts to Medicaid yet. These cuts will rip coverage away from seniors and people with disabilities needing long term care, low-income women and children, and those relying on mental health and substance abuse services in my district.   We should be working together to stabilize our insurance markets and extend critical funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program and Community Health Centers. Instead, Republicans have put forth a piece of legislation that puts patients last. I urge my Senate colleagues to reject this harmful Graham-Cassidy bill and work with us to improve our healthcare system.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/09/18/the-new-gop-health-care-measure-goes-further-than-the-failed-one/?utm_term=.2aa27b151dc0","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/09/18/the-new-gop-health-care-measure-goes-further-than-the-failed-one/?utm_term=.2aa27b151dc0","washingtonpost.com",43,30,23,2,0,2,10,39

As young people are struggling to afford college, Republicans have voted to eliminate their student loan interest deduction. As teachers are working every day to create opportunities for the next generation, Republicans have voted to eliminate their deduction that helps them purchase supplies for the classroom. As young families are looking to buy their first home, Republicans have voted to limit their mortgage interest deduction. As seniors and people with chronic illnesses are planning their long term care options, Republicans have voted to eliminate their medical expense deduction.  The list goes on and on. Now, after voting to drive up the deficit, House Republicans are going to go after the earned benefits, like Medicare, that my constituents rely on. That is shameful.  This is all so President Trump and Republicans can take a legislative victory lap. I urge the Senate to reject this tax scam and instead focus on how we can work together to give the American people a better deal.","status",NA,NA,79,35,29,2,1,0,26,56
