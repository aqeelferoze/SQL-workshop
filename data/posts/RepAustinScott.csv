Turn the sound on to hear what it is.    I have a couple of questions: How is it that Obamacare can mandate Americans purchase a product from an industry that is exempt from playing by the rules?    Why did President Obama and Democratic leaders leave the health insurance industry exempt from the antitrust laws of our country in their bill?    And what will our Republican leaders and President-elect Trump do about it?    I don’t know the answer to these questions, but I do know that I will stand up and fight for American citizens. Antitrust laws are designed to promote fair competition for the benefit and protection of consumers.  Leaving the health insurance industry exempt from the antitrust laws of our country is only good for the health insurance industry- not Americans. We have to stand up and do right by the people.  Applying the antitrust laws to the insurance industry makes the market more competitive, which in-turn drives down premium costs and increases choice. Makes sense to me.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepAustinScott/videos/1318518898212804/",NA,102,27,39,5,0,0,0,0

The individual assistance awarded yesterday from the White House and FEMA is NOT final. The declaration is amendable. My office has inquired about the status of Worth and our other counties under the Governor's original declaration. Worth County’s damage assessment has not been completed, but it is in the process of being completed within the next few days- same goes for several of our other counties. As FEMA and the state jointly complete their assessment of each of the 16 counties requested by Governor Deal, FEMA will continually amend the declaration. Those still in need of assistance, in Worth County and other areas, rest assured. President Trump and his administration have been unbelievably quick to offer assistance for majority of counties requested by Governor Deal. Governor Deal’s request for Federal Assistance included many other provisions which have not been granted, and more importantly have not been denied. As the federal government evaluates more areas based on need, it is my hope President Trump will strongly consider Governor Deal's request for Individual Assistance in Worth and Brooks Counties, Public Assistance in the many of our affected counties like Thomas County, and Hazard Mitigation for the entire state.","status",NA,NA,60,16,41,0,0,0,0,0

I want to be clear that I believe there were a number of problems in the health insurance market before the ACA passed. However, leaving the health insurance industry exempt from the antitrust laws of our country was one of the ACA’s most egregious missteps. This exemption is not only damaging to the consumer, leaving constituents in some counties I represent with only one choice of health insurer, but it also limits American's access to those who provide our health care like our physicians, hospitals, and pharmacies. I don’t think this issue alone solves all of the problems in the health care industry, but I don't think that any of the problems in the insurance market will be solved if this exemption stays in place.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepAustinScott/videos/1354888317909195/",NA,61,13,22,1,0,0,1,1

In case you missed it, here’s a rundown of what we talked about.   As a member of Congress, and as a Georgian, I was glad to hear President Trump make it clear he is looking towards the future to unite Americans, rebuild the economy, and put Americans back to work- something that many of you in Middle and South Georgia have repeatedly said is your number one concern. I am especially encouraged by his commitment to rebuilding our military, supporting our warfighters, and keeping us safe. He has exemplified this commitment by his appointment of General Mattis as Secretary of Defense.   I was also glad to hear about the President’s commitment to working with Dr. Tom Price from Georgia as our Secretary of HHS and Congress to replace Obamacare with a system that expands choice, increases access, and lowers costs; a patient-centered, free market solution that does not exclude people for pre-existing conditions and gives states the flexibility and resources they need to ensure no one is slipping through the cracks. I believe we must focus on repealing the antitrust exemption for the health care industry, an effort on which I’ve been working very hard. Two weeks ago, I testified in front of the Judiciary Committee about a bill that would repeal this exemption- that bill just passed the Committee this week.   We have to give President Trump a chance- and if we do, I firmly believe he'll be a good President. Some of this will mean keeping the men and women of the administration in our prayers. I look forward to working with President Trump to create a more prosperous, safer America for future generations.  In addition to President Trump’s address, we also discussed the future of Moody Air Force Base. One thing other bases don't have is the ability to transition from one mission to the other like we do at Moody. Moody has the ability to take on new missions, like training pilots from our ally countries, making the base, and the warfighters stationed there, a vital asset to our national security.","status",NA,NA,17,6,0,1,0,0,0,0

But I had a good reason! Generic drug prices are skyrocketing, affecting families and patients who are forced to choose between medicine and their health or paying their mortgage and making ends meet. These astronomical prices put vulnerable patients in a difficult situation at a time where they least need to be thinking of dollars and cents.  I don’t think this is a decision Americans should have to make.   I mentioned my heart wrenching discussion with a mother from Warner Robins whose daughter has juvenile diabetes. She has to have insulin or she dies. This drug can be found in other countries for just a fraction of what they have to pay for it here in America, and they are struggling with the cost of the drug.   In my speech, I also talked about a parent who I met with last week.  His son is named Gabe, and Gabe suffers from Duchenne muscular Dystrophy, a rare genetic disorder that requires a drug called Deflazacort to stay alive. Gabe is now 11 years old and has been taking Deflazacort since he was 5. Gabe’s family currently pays roughly $418.83 per year for Deflazacort from Europe, as it has not been available in the United States. However, recently, Marathon Pharmaceuticals bought the rights to Deflazacort.  Note I say bought the rights, because they spent almost nothing on research, development or trials.  Then, they to bring the drug to market under the name Emflaza priced at $89,000 a year. 89 THOUSAND for the same drug Gabe's family was having to get from another country for under $419 a year. This is the drug an 11 year old boy is taking to live. The American system should be set up in such a way as to drive costs down and increase availability of life-saving drugs, not the other way around.    This Congress, I call on my colleagues to work with me to ease the regulatory burden the FDA places on generic drug applicants in order to increase competition in this market, which currently has little to no competitors to drive down costs. We must also alleviate the FDA’s backlog on generic drug applications to bring more drugs to market.   In the coming months, I look forward to finding a conservative, free market solution to address the problematic rise in generic drug prices for American families.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepAustinScott/videos/1370268916371135/",NA,329,126,224,43,0,3,1,3
