Congressman Price has long been on a crusade to gut the foundations of America’s health system. From proposals to privatize Medicare and to cut Social Security, to block-granting Medicaid and repealing the Affordable Care Act, Representative Price’s complete disregard for the programs and resources that are working to bring vital health insurance and health care resources to millions of families is harmful to them, and it is disgraceful. Representative Price has also fought to diminish women’s health care and to abolish Planned Parenthood, threatening family planning services and a woman’s and her family’s right to make their own health decisions. And the allegations that he violated the STOCK Act, which prohibits lawmakers from using their role in Congress to make investment decisions, are particularly troubling. For these reasons, I strongly oppose his nomination, and I sincerely hope my friends in the Senate across the aisle will join in this effort.

Below is a word cloud reflecting many of those concerns.  If now-Secretary Price follows through on his long obsession with privatizing Medicare, block-granting Medicaid, and repealing the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans will lose adequate health insurance coverage.

This nomination is another indication that, far from fulfilling his promise to “drain the swamp,” President Trump is filling his Cabinet with insiders like Mr. Mnuchin, who may understand the intricacies of Wall Street, but who knows shockingly little about the hardships faced on Main Street. After beginning his career at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Mnuchin rose to become known as the “Foreclosure King” because of the dubious practices such as “robo-signing” at OneWest Bank.

It is not a pathway toward returning the Senate to doing its work the way it is supposed to be done. More than being dead on arrival, this budget is truly odious on arrival.    The appropriations process is where we set the nation’s spending priorities.  It is where priorities become more than concepts or promises or words; it is where they become real.  This is just the latest version of the President’s unbalanced priorities.  It is an unbalanced budget with serious and harmful consequences for our economy, for working families, for those who are struggling, for our environment, for health, and for our national security.

When Secretary Price appeared before the Appropriations Committee today, I made it clear that the impact of this budget will have on Vermont’s and other American families is unacceptable.  For starters, the proposed budget cuts the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by 17 percent, the National Institutes of Health -- which directs crucial medical research into cures and treatments for diseases from cancer to diabetes -- by 21 percent, and eliminates the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which many Vermonters rely on to survive Vermont’s winters.  And these draconian cuts are only the beginning.  I am also strongly opposed to Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a bill that will insure millions fewer Americans and would slash Medicaid.  The cruel elements of the House Trumpcare bill penalize sick Americans, all to give massive tax breaks to special interests and the wealthiest among us.  We can’t be sure what the Senate Trumpcare bill will be like because Senate Republicans have decided to craft their legislation behind closed doors, forsaking bipartisanship and denying the American people the right to know what their representatives are working on.

With no hearings, no debate, no vetting process, and no score, this plan breaks every promise the President made about what he would do in repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.  Cobbled together behind closed doors, it is a cruel and cynical hoax, played on millions upon millions of Americans who would lose all or some of their health insurance protections under this plan.  Millions of Americans would not be able to afford insurance.  The driving principle in writing this travesty is not improving health insurance, a goal we all share.  The main goal is to free up funds to give another massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans.  It is a huge tax cut for the rich, disguised as a health plan.  This bill would affect real people, real families, in Vermont and across the country.  This isn’t a political campaign.  This is about life, and death, and every family’s access to health care.   These enormous Medicaid cuts would have especially devastating effects in Vermont.  One in four adults in Vermont is covered by Medicaid.  Almost half of Vermont’s children rely on Medicaid or CHIP for basic health care.  Two in three nursing home residents receive Medicaid.  These are the most vulnerable Vermonters.  These are nursing home patients and their families, pregnant women, children, people with disabilities, and their families -- Vermonters working multiple jobs, but who still cannot afford health insurance.   Incredibly, this bill also undermines Vermont’s ability to fight the opioid crisis.  Vermont has done excellent work to cover comprehensive mental health and addiction treatment services under Medicaid, which would be at risk under this bill.    The bill also attacks women’s health by allowing states to choose what insurance plans have to cover, putting maternity benefits and other benefits at risk.  It tells women they cannot choose their providers by disallowing Medicaid reimbursement to Planned Parenthood clinics.    A true health care bill does not cut millions of Americans off health insurance.  A true health care bill does not allow insurance companies to charge people more for less coverage.

Lost to many in the White House and on Capitol Hill is the fact that these are decisions that literally mean health or illness and life or death to countless people.  Not much is new in the latest Trumpcare bill.  It will still drop millions of Americans from Medicaid support – working families who are struggling, parents and grandparents in nursing homes, and families coping to care for members with disabilities.  It will make it harder for Americans with pre-existing conditions to find and buy insurance, and it will decimate Vermont’s ability to combat opioid and drug addiction.  It will inflate premiums and deductibles, particularly on older Americans, and will price millions of families and individuals out of being able to afford coverage.  It is way past time for Senate Republicans and this White House to stop this reckless exercise and work with us to find ways to bring lifesaving health care to more Americans, not to fewer families, as the Republican plan would do.

It is actually a tax bill in the guise of a health plan.  It should come as no surprise to anyone that this abomination of a bill, cobbled together behind closed doors, has fallen short under Leader McConnell’s hyper-partisan strategy.  What IS surprising is that even after it has become clear that the American people reject Republican efforts to rob them of their health insurance, Leader McConnell now wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement, a proposal that the CBO has estimated would remove health insurance from 32 million Americans. This is bad politics and worse policy.  It would DIRECTLY hurt millions of Americans.  This morning, Leader McConnell said:  “These are not just numbers on a page, these are the lives of real people.”  I couldn’t agree more, and this plan puts the lives of thousands of Vermonters in jeopardy, which is why I will do all I can to defeat this latest disastrous plan.  It would drag our nation’s families back to the dark ages when Vermonters could be denied insurance for pre-existing conditions, and when health insurance was a privilege for the wealthy.  Repealing the Affordable Care Act would be a disaster for Vermonters and the nation.  The goal of these successive Republican plans is not, and never has been, to truly help people.

He rallies his dwindling supporters by exploiting fear and resentment, marginalizing those who are vulnerable and even those who risk their lives for our country and their communities.  It is shameful and far beneath the office he holds.   Today President Trump is targeting yet another exemplary group of people who enrich the fabric of our society, our nation’s DREAMers.  They are our friends and our neighbors.  They serve in our armed forces and as first responders, they contribute to our schools and universities, and they work and serve in our communities.   DREAMers, by definition, came to the United States at no fault of their own as children.  They have since played by our country’s rules and seek only the chance to contribute to America – their home, and often the only country they remember.  When President Trump threatens to unravel the DACA program, he threatens not only thousands of DREAMers, but the American dream itself.  His action, with the complicity of Attorney General Sessions, is petty and malicious, and it is harmful in so many ways.  Republicans control both the Senate and the House.  Some have already spoken out against the President's decision to abandon DACA.  But their words ring hollow if they are not ready to act upon them.

One group in particular – corporate CEOs – had a special reason to be thankful: the Republican tax bill we are considering today. This is a bill that cheats our future for the sake of tax-cut windfall for the one percent.  It does absolutely wonderful things for the wealthiest taxpayers, like the President, his cronies and his family.  But it does not advance the common good.  The true purpose and slant of this bill are belied by the fact that huge tax cuts for corporations would be permanent, while the meager adjustments for hardworking Americans are only temporary.  Critical deductions relied upon by many Vermonters, including the State and Local Tax Deduction, are reduced or eliminated.  These changes are likely to result in higher taxes for many working families.  It offers crumbs to hardworking Americans, while the wealthiest individuals and corporations reap the rewards of this bill.   Even more appallingly, to pay for these tax giveaways for corporations, Republicans intend to strip health insurance from 13 million fewer Americans, a move that threatens to seriously destabilize the health insurance market.  Americans with health insurance today will face higher premiums as a result of this bill becoming law.  As the Congressional Budget Office found in its recent analysis, by 2027 the bill takes away billions of dollars in federal healthcare support for Americans making less than $75,000.  Another non-tax provision would cause irreparable harm to our environment by opening up oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) – all to pay for tax breaks for corporations, including those in the oil and gas industry.  Exposing this breathtaking area of the country to the ravages of oil and gas drilling would be an environmental tragedy. Turning ANWR into an oil field is yet another gift to corporate interests at the expense of the American people and at the cost of damage to their public lands.   To add insult to injury, even after targeting the middle class, American’s health insurance and the environment to pay for permanent corporate tax cuts, the bill will still end up adding more than $1.4 trillion to our deficit and debt over the next 10 years.  Blowing a hole in the budget will seed the ground for rising interest rates that will hit every family and drag down our economy, and Republican cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will follow.  We need to go back to the drawing board and start this process over again.  Let Republicans and Democrats work together on real tax reform that simplifies the tax code and provides real benefits to working Americans.  This bill is not tax reform.  This is a cartoonish caricature of what real tax reform should look like.  It is dishonest to its core.  It is cynical, and it can only breed more cynicism by the public.  It is not only bad policy, it is horrible policy.  And it is wrong.","status",NA,NA,203,97,97,6,3,4,42,75
