Barton has attended every inauguration since he was elected in 1984, except for President Barack Obama’s second. But his favorite memory was from President Ronald Reagan’s second inaugural ceremony in 1985, which was moved into the Rotunda due to frigid temperatures.   Barton recalled going to the House chamber after the ceremony, and stopping at the Cloakroom. He said he was the only one there when, to his surprise, actor Jimmy Stewart walked in. The congressman recalled them chatting for a few minutes, and he told Stewart how much he enjoyed the film “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.”  As further proof that you never know who you’ll run into around inauguration time, Barton remembered going to a party that same year at the Mayflower Hotel. He got out of his cab, and Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra took it next.","link","http://www.rollcall.com/news/hoh/patience-and-perspective-inauguration-memories-and-advice","rollcall.com",23,4,1,0,0,1,0,0

Back then, DOE helped Americans gain affordable and reliable energy, oversaw our nuclear program in the name of national security, and encouraged science and innovation in ways the private sector was incapable. More recently, this Department, like so many others, has fallen victim to excessive bureaucracy and bloated government spending accounts that detract from its original mission.   “Fortunately, we now have a man who possesses a very strong energy background and has a track record of proven executive leadership. I have known Governor Perry since we were classmates at Texas A&M. We have since worked hand in hand on countless projects, and I am sure our relationship will grow even stronger over the coming months and years as we work to return the Department of Energy to its core mission and reduce waste.  “Welcome to Washington, Mr. Secretary. I could not be more proud to have a friend, Texan, and Aggie at the helm of the Department of Energy.”","link","https://joebarton.house.gov/news/email/show.aspx?ID=EYE6ZB4KWTXHE","joebarton.house.gov",50,15,2,3,2,0,0,9

Premiums and deductibles have gone up, insurance choices have gone down, and American families have suffered. Across the 6th District, I have heard from those that simply could not afford health insurance and small business owners that were forced to close their doors due to overbearing health insurance costs. That’s why we worked through the night at the Energy and Commerce Committee – to begin to rebuild our broken health system. ""While a huge step forward, this is not a perfect bill. House Republicans made a commitment to repeal Obamacare and this bill, in its current form, does not go far enough. ""I along with Reps. Blackburn (R-TN) and Hudson (R-NC) offered two substantive amendments. Our amendments would move up the freeze date for new enrollment in the Medicaid expansion at the enhanced match under Obamacare to January 1, 2018. Additionally, the end date for enrollees to phase out of the expanded program would be established as January 1, 2023. States would still receive Medicaid benefits from the federal government at the rates established before Obamacare. These amendments would result in billions of dollars of savings due to the shortened timetable for ending Obamacare Medicaid expansion funding. They will remain under consideration as we continue to work through the legislative process. ""Our work is far from done, but it has begun. A 27 hour markup will not deter our mission.""","link","http://joebarton.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=347","joebarton.house.gov",20,60,2,0,1,0,0,20

That was a concession to conservatives, and has already been endorsed by groups like the Republican Study Committee.

It repealed the individual and employer mandates. It repealed almost all of the ACA taxes. It defunded Planned Parenthood. It put in place a mechanism to slow the rate of growth in Medicaid spending.

We finally made it happen in December of 2015 and look where we are now.   When we lifted the ban in December 2015, here's what I said:   “This represents the most substantial energy policy enacted in a generation,” stated Barton. “Of the remaining scarcity energy policies from the 1970s, lifting the ban on exports was the last vestige of unnecessary government overreach from the time. We have given all Americans a big Christmas present- one that will provide tens of thousands of jobs, bolster our economy, and keep the energy revolution in America alive and well.”  “Lifting the ban will have an immediate impact on all Texans. As rig counts have been down, we must keep the energy boom alive. At a time of global unrest, energy security is one of the surest ways to maintain and grow our influence in volatile areas around the world. Today, the American people won and with US crude on the world market, the world is a better place.”","link","https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-oil-exports-double-reshaping-vast-global-markets-1496833200","wsj.com",23,10,2,1,0,0,0,7

Thirty years ago, the federal government committed to a permanent repository for nuclear waste - it is time we make good on that promise.”   Rep. Barton has worked tirelessly for over two decades to move the ball forward on safe and secure high-level waste storage, both long-term and interim. Nuclear waste is at present stored on-site at nuclear power generators that are often near communities, which raises both security and safety concerns.","link","https://joebarton.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=357","joebarton.house.gov",17,6,0,0,0,0,0,4

Barton (R-TX) and Doyle (D-PA) introduced the Wounded Officers Recovery Act of 2017 (H.R. 3298) on behalf of over one hundred Members of Congress - including each player in this year’s Congressional Baseball Game. The bipartisan, bicameral bill will amend the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund to expand eligibility to include any United States Capitol Police employee that has been injured in the line of duty. The fund at present only allows funds donated to be distributed to families of officers killed in the line of duty. A companion bill will be introduced by the Senate baseball players later this week.   “Sometimes, even simple and caring gestures require an act of Congress. Following the tragic shooting on June 14th, the Congressional Baseball game achieved record setting crowds and donations for local charities. This year we will be donating a portion of the funds raised to help those injured at the baseball practice,” said Barton. “Officers Bailey and Griner saved my life along with those of my sons and of everyone out at that field. This bill allows the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund to distribute funds to any of their employees who are seriously injured in the line of duty. Officers Bailey and Griner have received a great deal of care and will require more - the members of the baseball teams wish to make sure they have the necessary resources for recovery.”    “Over the years, a number of Capitol Police Officers have been killed or injured in the line of duty,” Congressman Doyle observed. “Every member of the House and Senate understand the risks that are willingly taken by these officers every day to keep us, our staffs, and the Capitol’s many visitors safe. The Capitol Police Memorial Fund was originally established with a specific limited purpose – namely, to make it easier for individuals to provide financial support for the families of two Capitol Police Officers killed in the line of duty in 1998. In light of the attack on the Congressional Republicans’ baseball practice last month, in which two Capitol Police Officers were wounded while bravely working to stop the gunman, we believe that the law should be amended to allow the Fund to provide similar support to US Capitol Police Officers seriously injured in the line of duty.”","link","https://joebarton.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=359","joebarton.house.gov",14,3,0,0,1,0,0,0

Joe Barton (R-TX) and Kathy Castor (D-FL) introduced the Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act of 2017 (ACE Kids Act), H.R. 3325. The ACE Kids Act will help improve the coordination of and access to high quality care to ensure optimal outcomes for children with complex medical conditions on Medicaid, while assisting to contain costs. Other original cosponsors in the House include; Reps. Gene Green, Anna Eshoo, Dave Reichert, and Jaime Herrera Beutler. A similar bill, S. 428, was introduced in the Senate in February  Most children with complex medical conditions receive care from multiple pediatric providers at multiple locations whom they access through Medicaid. The state-by-state variability of Medicaid programs and lack of a coordinated care plan creates a care system that is often fragmented and unnecessarily burdensome for these children and families who frequently cross state lines to access specialized care.  “This bill is about giving our nations sickest children better care. It cuts through the bureaucratic red tape and tries to save the taxpayers some money. This innovative approach Congresswoman Castor and I have worked to draft has received buy in from children’s hospitals, primary and specialty care providers, state Medicaid directors, and family advocates,” said Rep. Barton. “We are confident this bill is ready to move through Congress and land on the President’s desk.”  “The goal of the bipartisan ACE Kids Act is simple: put children with complex medical conditions and their families first,” U.S. Rep. Castor said. “A medical home that coordinates care also saves precious time and money for families. I am proud of St. Joseph's Children's Hospital Chronic-Complex Clinic in Tampa, Fla., for leading the nation with its medical home model, and I look forward to working with my colleague, U.S. Rep. Barton, to help pass this legislation.”     Background on the ACE Kids Act:  Medicaid covers roughly 30 million children; approximately 6 percent of these children have complex medical conditions yet account for 40 percent of Medicaid spending on children.  The ACE Kids Act of 2017 is designed to improve care for medically complex children in Medicaid, while also reducing spending. Published studies show cost savings and improved quality of care for this population when enrolled in an integrated and coordinated care program.  In the 114th Congress, the ACE Kids Act was supported by 43 cosponsors in the Senate and 228 cosponsors in the House. In the 115th Congress, S. 428 has 17 bipartisan cosponsors at present.   The ACE Kids Act is optional for states, children and families, and health care providers.","link","https://joebarton.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=360","joebarton.house.gov",6,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

Joe Barton released the following statement after voting against the Senate Amendment to House Amendment to Senate Amendment to H.R. 601: Hurricane Supplemental, Debt Limit, Continuing Appropriations, and Flood Insurance Package.  ""Earlier this week, I voted for an emergency relief package for victims of Hurricane Harvey. That package went to the Senate, where it was attached to a much larger public debt ceiling extension.  “Today, when the hurricane relief-debt ceiling increase bill came back from the Senate, I voted no. I am not against voting for relief programs to help hurricane victims, but I am against raising the public debt ceiling without a plan to reduce deficits in the short term, and eliminate them in the long term. The money we vote to spend today will have to be paid back by our children and grandchildren. We have yet again missed an opportunity for substantial reforms and reduced spending.  “The debt ceiling extension runs until the middle of December. Between now and then, I am going to work to craft a package of budget reforms with the goal of balancing the federal budget, so we do not continue to raise the public debt ceiling.”","status",NA,NA,122,112,20,8,1,3,4,64

These are babies just like the ones we see in Neonatal Intensive Care Units in hospitals in our area struggling for life, needing love.  “This bill will ban abortions in the United States after the 20 week threshold. The only exceptions are when the life of the mother is in danger or in cases of rape and incest. This bill won’t end all abortion, but it will prevent future suffering and death.  “All life is precious and should be respected and I back that up with my vote.
