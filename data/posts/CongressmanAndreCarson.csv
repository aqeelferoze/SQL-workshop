Growing up hearing about acid rain and global warming, I knew this was not a certainty. But I have been heartened that people of all political persuasions have been standing up and calling for changes. They have acted at the ballot box, with their pocketbooks and in their personal behaviors to make little small changes that add up to a big difference. The Paris Agreement was one our biggest steps yet, as people around the world finally acknowledged the shared sacrifice necessary to leave a cleaner planet for the for future generations. With his decision to withdraw the United States from this agreement, President Trump is standing alone among international leaders in looking backward rather than forward.   Over the last several decades, the world has seen that a low carbon future is not just about climate. It is about promoting innovative entrepreneurship and creating good paying, green manufacturing and infrastructure jobs. It is about an economy where industry changes but new jobs ensure that no workers are left behind. These are already some of the fastest growing sectors in the country, prompting many of our biggest industrial players to change their tune and invest in cleaner practices. Yet, today President Trump decided to turn his back on this economic growth in favor of a mythical future in which the old ways of doing business prevail, despite all evidence showing around the world. This will do nothing but leave American workers behind as China, Europe and others benefit from the growing green industries.  Despite President Trump’s shortsightedness, I remain committed to leaving my daughter, and children around the world, a cleaner world where they can build prosperous lives for themselves and their families. I stand ready to cities, states, individuals and businesses that choose to act on their own to make this a reality.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanAndreCarson/photos/a.182700648415720.42235.123884330964019/1535437226475382/?type=3",NA,212,19,29,21,0,0,8,1

I stood in strong opposition to the last ban and I oppose this one just as strongly. It’s driven by the same discrimination, fear, and ignorance as the first.   Today, the Supreme Court cancelled its hearing on President Trump’s first Muslim ban. I have no doubt that after further review the court will not be fooled by the addition of non-Muslim countries. Like the previous versions, this repackaged ban will primarily block travelers from Muslim countries, as the President seeks to make good on his discriminatory campaign promises. It’s intent, like President Trump’s promises, are clear.  This is not who we are as a country.
