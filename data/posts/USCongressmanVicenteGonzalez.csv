""The Capital Markets Subcommittee links Congress and Wall Street with oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee is newly created and has jurisdiction over combating the flow of funds to terrorist groups in this country and around the world,"" he said. ""The Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee will play an integral role as we move to make financial institutions and practices more safe and transparent for the American public.""

""Zika is a serious threat to communities in South Texas, and I am glad state and federal officials recognize the importance of treating and preventing the transmission of the virus in the region,"" said Congressman Vicente Gonzalez. ""This funding will provide the Hidalgo County Health Department with much-needed resources to expand its screening and support investigations of the virus. The funds will also enable the Department to educate the community through outreach efforts. I will continue to work with Congressmen Cuellar and Vela, who have also helped in securing these funds, to ensure that our communities are equipped to address any and all health risks.""   “The safety of our people is imperative in this fight against Zika,” said Rep. Filemon Vela. “I have met personally with Director Friedan of the CDC and Commissioner Hellerstadt of Texas DSHS to provide continued support and ensure that the $1.1 billion in funding that we passed in Congress is utilized efficiently and effectively.”   “I fought for these federal funds so our community can invest in proven prevention methods,” said Rep. Henry Cuellar. “Zika virus infections have been reported here in our border communities, so vigilance is more important than ever. Now, our local officials have the resources they need to protect Hidalgo families. I thank the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr. John Hellerstedt, Commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, for their help in securing these funds.”   Congress provided 394 million to the CDC as part of the Zika supplemental funding bill. These funds were part of a $25 million federal allocation for Zika preparedness to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), about $10 million of which is flagged for local jurisdictions including 16 health departments. Those jurisdictions, including Hidalgo County, were selected for their higher risk of Zika cases: mainly border, gulf coast, and urban areas. Laredo received another $560,000 as well.  In July 2016, in response to a request from Congress, the CDC contracted a team of public health professionals to work with the City of Laredo Health Department and other health professionals from Laredo to Brownsville, focusing on increasing surveillance, prevention, preparation and education to combat the Zika virus.","status",NA,NA,7,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

The first 40 days of the Trump presidency have deepened the divisions exposed by last year’s election.

It is my hope that President Donald Trump will focus his remarks on working together across party lines to strengthen our nation. His message should center on job creation, economic growth, supporting the middle class, and keeping Americans safe. The President must emphasize his commitment to military members, veterans, seniors, and vulnerable populations, and he must tell the American people how he intends to fulfill his promise to ensure the availability of health insurance for everyone. Tonight, President Trump has an opportunity to lay out his vision for working with Democrats and Republicans in Congress.
