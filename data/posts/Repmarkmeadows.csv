These are just a few of the words to describe #Obamacare--our crumbling healthcare system that is hurting working families, bankrupting businesses, and driving our economy into the ground. This law needs to be fully repealed. Americans cannot afford to bear the burden of its failure any longer.  While Republicans continue to debate how to best repeal and replace Obamacare, we agree on the big picture: our current system does not work and is unacceptable.  While serious concerns remain, I have been pleased to hear the Speaker commit to bringing up a healthcare replacement bill within days, not weeks, of a repeal measure. This has been a top priority of mine and the Freedom Caucus’, as I believe it is critical that we give the American people a clear direction and assurance of a smooth transition toward a sound, high quality, and affordable healthcare market—especially so the most vulnerable can get the coverage they need.   Going forward, I strongly believe and will continue to express that a full repeal of Obamacare should take effect within two years during the 115th Congress.

We committed to the American people to repeal every tax, every mandate, the regulations, and to defund Planned Parenthood. That’s what the American people expect us to do – and they expect us to do it quickly.   Therefore we strongly encourage Republican leadership on Capitol Hill to take up the Affordable Care Act repeal bill that already passed the House, the Senate, and went to President Obama’s desk in early 2016. There’s no reason we should put anything less on President Trump’s desk than we put on President Obama’s now that we know it will be signed into law. We strongly encourage that this bill be brought to the floor for consideration as soon as possible so we can begin undoing this law that is hurting American families.""","link","https://meadows.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-meadows-and-jordan-call-for-vote-on-2015-obamacare-repeal-bill","meadows.house.gov",198,59,18,17,0,1,1,15

Sanford:  1) The bill will legalize the sale of inexpensive #insurance by getting rid of mandates 2) The bill will expand options with Health Savings Accounts 3) It will allow individuals to join together in associations to buy insurance so they can gain leverage toward lower prices 4) It severs employment from health insurance, so you don't lose your health insurance if you lose your job 5) It allows those with pre-existing conditions a two-year period to sign up for health insurance with no penalty  The bottom line: Obamacare needs to be repealed now.

When I ran for reelection last November, I made a promise to my constituents--a promise that I would fight for a full repeal of Obamacare, including every tax, every mandate, and every burdensome #regulation in this broken law.   I also committed to working toward a same-timeline vote on a fiscally responsible replacement plan that would protect the most vulnerable and allow families to have more control over their healthcare choices.   That's what I remain committed to, and I cannot settle for anything less. My constituents deserve nothing less.  I believe Obamacare should be repealed immediately. I also firmly disagree with the notion that we should replace it with elements that would be just as ineffective and just as expensive--or leave portions of the ACA in, giving people 'Obamacare Lite.' This would be wrong.  The time is now. Let's get this done. Let's actually do what we told the voters we would do.","link","http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/27/politics/mark-meadows-vote-leaked-obamacare-bill/index.html","cnn.com",360,137,71,25,1,5,0,9

The job should be much simpler: do what we told the voters we would do.  While I have great respect for my colleagues that are willing to work on and share ideas for #healthcare reform, the #GOP leadership's #Obamacare replacement bill doesn't fit our job description. This plan isn't what we told the voters we would do.   I want to fully repeal Obamacare as much as (or more than) anyone--the #ACA is a disaster that needs to go. We committed to the voters that we would fully repeal it, and I believe we need to follow through on that promise now.  At the same time, attaching a so-called ""repeal"" to the passage of a new government entitlement program would be a critical mistake. All we would be doing is passing another big-spending, bureaucracy-centered healthcare plan under a #Republican name. That would be wrong.    We didn't tell the voters we would get rid of Obamacare but keep the taxes. We didn't tell them we'd repeal it but keep the mandates. We told the voters we would fully repeal this law. That's what we owe them. Nothing less.  Let’s fully repeal this law using the same bill we sent to President Obama in 2016, and immediately following, have an open and transparent debate on the three replacement plans that exist--voting on them within the same week.

Mayaguez Incident.  The ""S.S. Mayaguez Incident"" is often referred to as the “Last Battle of Vietnam,” but veterans of this incident are currently ineligible to receive the Vietnam Service Medal. This bill rectifies that error and would allow veterans of the incident—both living and deceased—to receive the medal in appropriate recognition for their sacrifice to our nation.  When we were writing the bill, I was reminded of one of Western North Carolina's own! Captain Ric Hunter served 27 years in the U.S. Air Force and was awarded an Air Medal for his efforts as a pilot in the SS Mayaguez rescue operation. Heroes like Captain Hunter deserve to be recognized, and I'm hopeful that this bill will do just that.

You may remember over the past couple of months when I've announced that I would not be able to support the GOP's original version of the AHCA. I did not believe the original bill would bring down healthcare costs for Americans--particularly my constituents in WNC--and I've consistently said that I will not vote for any bill that fails to accomplish that purpose.   After countless hours of meetings, negotiations, and phone calls, I believe we've reached that point.  House conservatives have worked tirelessly to improve the American Health Care Act (AHCA) to make it more beneficial for the American people. Due to improvements to the AHCA and the addition of an amendment from my friend Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ), the House Freedom Caucus has taken an official position in support of the current proposal.  The MacArthur amendment will grant states the ability to repeal cost driving aspects of Obamacare left in place under the original #AHCA. This will be a SIGNIFICANT catalyst in bringing premiums down while protecting those with pre-existing conditions.    While the revised version still does not fully repeal Obamacare, we are prepared to support it to keep our promise to the American people to lower #healthcare costs. We look forward to working with our Senate colleagues to improve the bill. Our work will continue until we fully repeal Obamacare.  Please know that I remain committed to getting this done. My goals throughout this entire process have always been 1) to bring #premiums down for all Americans, and 2) protect the most vulnerable. I will keep working until we accomplish both of those goals.  And for those asking, the portion about members of Congress being exempt from the bill is being stripped out through an amendment. I will not vote for any bill that gives me a special exemption that my constituents do not get.","link","http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-health-care-plan-gets-backing-freedom-caucus-after-changes-n751356","nbcnews.com",238,303,66,19,2,2,3,63

The new version of the bill was supported by myself and my colleagues in the House Freedom Caucus.  From the very beginning of this process, I’ve stated that my goals were to 1) bring down premiums for Americans, and 2) protect those with pre-existing conditions. When the original version of this bill was released, I did not feel that either goal would be accomplished, and thus made it clear that I would not support the bill without changes.   After weeks of negotiations, meetings, countless hours of discussion, and substantive changes to the bill, I’m thrilled to say that significant improvements were made. I believe we reached the point where both of these criteria will be met.    While there are a lot of individuals who deserve credit for this, I particularly want to recognize two of my friends, Congressman Tom MacArthur and Rep. Fred Upton, for their work in negotiating the closing details of the bill. They are both honest brokers and were critical players in this.  I also want to thank President Donald J. Trump—I cannot tell you all how much I’ve seen this President work behind the scenes to bring this deal home. You have a #President that is incredibly focused on keeping his campaign promises to you. This bill is a major step in that agenda.  This has been a long process, and there is still work to be done—but today’s vote is a vital step in bringing relief to so many Americans that are being crushed by the broken system of #Obamacare. Today we are one step closer. Help is on the way.","status",NA,NA,574,677,116,62,2,2,18,260

My statement below: ---- “I applaud President Trump for following through on this campaign promise he made to millions of voters across the country. The Paris Accord is a bad deal for the American people—it hampers economic growth, burdens job creators, and stifles innovation to preserve an agreement where the benefits are miniscule at best. We all agree that we must be good stewards of the earth, but it doesn’t require a treaty never ratified by Congress to accomplish that. Time and time again we’ve seen that businesses will adapt to consumer demand to use more environmentally friendly practices–there is no need to cripple entire industries with sweeping regulations.   Today’s decision by President Trump is another step toward accomplishing the long-term goal that the President emphasized so successfully during his campaign: putting the interests of the American worker first.”","status",NA,NA,799,336,89,145,1,3,12,217

Trump--the EPA has begun work to rescind the Obama era 'Water Rule,' known as 'WOTUS.'  The 'WOTUS' rule from 2015 extended the reach of federal EPA regulations to rule over small, more local streams and waterways--placing a significant burden on farms, rural economies, and local communities. Rolling back this rule is a huge win for them.  I continue to believe: America can preserve and protect our environment without overreaching, counterproductive federal regulations that harm working families and communities far more than they benefit them. This decision by the EPA is a major step forward toward that end.

As you may know, for the last 7 years, the federal government has owed Swain County $39.2 million as a part of the ""Road to Nowhere"" settlement (a dispute that has dated back to WWII), and as expected, the county has run into all kinds of problems getting their money that they deserve.  In June of this year, I introduced a bill to require the government to pay $35.2 million of the settlement, but due to various restrictions, we would be about $4 million short. Secretary Zinke then stepped up, agreed to cut through the red tape, and announced he would release the remaining $4 million from the Department of Interior--putting Swain County on track to get their full funding.  This was special to be a part of--now Swain County is on track to getting the full allotment of money owed to them. I want to thank Secretary Zinke for his incredible willingness to work with us, Senator Tillis for his efforts, and the Swain County Board for the countless hours they poured into this issue. I'm thrilled to see this happen and am hopeful we can close the deal on the full funding soon!

It is important to plan ahead and talk about what you will do before, during and after an emergency. You need to talk about how will you get to a safe place, get in touch with each other and get back to each other.  https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/FamEmePlan_2012.pdf  Your plan should contain: • Phone numbers of a pre-assigned contact person for family members to call • List of where to find information on shelters (television, radio, this website, ReadyNC mobile app) • How to be safe if you stay in your home during an emergency • What to do with your pets • Thoughts about any older adults or those with functional needs in the home  Mold your plans for your family’s needs. Think about creating a group of neighbors, friends or family to help each other in emergencies. Talk how that group can help each other connect, care for children, pets or other needs.  Knowing how you will respond to an emergency at home, school or work will help you remain calm, think clearly and react well. Being ready helps you and your family. It also lowers the workload of fire fighters, police and emergency medical workers.","link","https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/FamEmePlan_2012.pdf","ready.gov",27,13,8,1,0,0,0,0

They're expected to claim that repealing the #mandate would now save far less money than originally projected--which was around $400 billion.   For context: All throughout this summer, we were playing by one set of rules with #healthcare on the individual mandate. Now that the discussion has moved to #TaxReform, the #CBO is once again moving the goalpost.   This is completely unacceptable--we should require the CBO to be transparent in disclosing their models to the American people. There is no reason why their methodology should be hidden from public view and scrutiny.  Hinging the people's priorities on the projections of an agency that not only refuses to be transparent but has proven to be so consistently wrong does a disservice disservice to the people we represent in #Congress.  It's time to seriously re-think the CBO.

The Senate will pass the bill later this evening, and following that, it will go to the President's desk as soon as TONIGHT.  The forgotten men and women of our country voted to elect President Trump and a Republican Congress to fix our broken tax code that taxes Americans too highly, ships their jobs overseas, and directly undermines the fundamental principles that make America great.   All of that changes today. We're giving the American people their money back. We're making the country more competitive for job creation and wage growth. And we’re igniting the kind of economic growth that every American deserves.   Business as usual is OVER.  Today is a momentous day for America.","status",NA,NA,697,394,93,149,11,1,13,196
