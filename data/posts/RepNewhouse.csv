DOL would make awards to employers, on a voluntary basis, who recruit, employ, and retain veterans; and provide community and charitable services supporting the veteran community. Employers would earn either platinum or gold status based on requirements related to the number of veterans hired each year, if they provide pay equity for Guardsmen and Reserve employees who were called up to active military service, and if certain other requirements are met.

No American should feel forgotten or left out of the promise to pursue happiness. Tonight, I was heartened by an optimistic and unifying message that the President is working to restore limited government, improve economic opportunity, and ensure the safety of all Americans. He honored our fallen heroes, like Ryan Owens, whose sacrifice will never be forgotten.  There is much work to do. We must rescue Americans from the consequences of the failures of Obamacare by restoring access to quality, affordable health insurance options. Reversing job-killing regulations and delivering on tax reform will help spur economic growth and create opportunity for families. Just today, the President signed an order to review the intrusive and overreaching Waters of the United States rule, which is great news for our agriculture community. Improving our nation’s infrastructure must prioritize critical water storage projects in the West and in Washington state, such as the Yakima River Basin Water Enhancement Project. And securing our borders by enforcing immigration laws must be met with efforts to reform our immigration system. On all of these issues and more, I look forward to working with the President to restore a ‘can-do’ spirit in America.","status",NA,NA,217,95,19,16,2,2,2,25

Obamacare is not working, and we must act to improve our health care system. I have heard countless stories from Washingtonians whose coverage has not translated to affordable care. Many families are struggling with rising premiums and deductibles. We must transition to a better health care system that puts patients first, not higher taxes and more government mandates. We must strengthen the safety net for the most vulnerable while providing more choices that allow Americans to access the insurance options that they—not the government—want to purchase. I am disappointed that we have reached a delay in moving forward on solutions, but I will continue to work to support healthcare proposals that put individuals first, not the government bureaucracy.","status",NA,NA,125,217,15,7,4,3,1,52

I believe such decisions should be made with substantial local input and support from the local communities that will be most impacted by the proposed Grizzly Bear Restoration Plan.

My time with my beautiful wife, Carol, is a blessing that I will always cherish. Everyone who has known and loved Carol understands that the feeling of loss that we share will be with us for a long time. It will take time for our sadness to heal. Carol was incredibly strong, giving, and passionate about life—especially enjoying the time we all have together. I have no doubt that she would want her loved ones and her community to continue working in ways that serve one another and to find joy and purpose together. Through my faith and in the many happy memories I have of Carol and our family, I am learning to find peace and solace day-by-day.  On behalf of my family, I would like to thank everyone in our community who visited, called, sent flowers, and mailed or texted or posted an encouraging note during this time. I especially want to thank everyone who has prayed for us. You continue to lift my spirit and my family’s as we have struggled and continue to struggle. I ask for those prayers to continue during the coming weeks. I also encourage everyone who reads this message and knows someone who is going through a difficult time to reach out and support that individual.

Greg Walden, the Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Rep. Walden makes a very important argument on restarting Yucca as the nation's permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel and the waste at Hanford: ""The waste currently sitting at the Hanford site is engineered by design to be sent to the Yucca Mountain permanent geological repository facility in the Nevada desert. Yucca Mountain was chosen by Congress in 1987 to house both spent nuclear fuel and the kind of high-level waste found at Hanford. At Yucca Mountain, these materials would be safely isolated 1,000 feet underground. In fact, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission determined that the site could safely store this nuclear material for one million years."" http://www.eastoregonian.com/eo/columnists/20170626/walden-want-to-clean-up-hanford-finish-yucca-mountain","link","http://www.eastoregonian.com/eo/columnists/20170626/walden-want-to-clean-up-hanford-finish-yucca-mountain","eastoregonian.com",50,14,10,0,0,4,0,1

Over the past two decades, opioid overdoses have quadrupled in the United States. Washington has faced significant increases in drug overdose death rates, including a 70% increase in synthetic opioid overdose deaths in just the past ten years. It is clear this is a real crisis, which is why Congress is committed to combating this growing epidemic.  Late last year, Congress passed sweeping legislation called the “21st Century Cures Act,” bipartisan legislation that authorized $6.3 billion in funding to bring our health care innovation infrastructure into the 21st Century. This legislation included $1 billion for opioid prevention and treatment programs throughout all 50 states over two years. Earlier this spring, the federal government began awarding grants to the states in order to confront the opioid crisis, including $11.7 million to Washington state.   While these funds will help expand treatment options, there is still much more work to be done at the federal level, which is why I cosponsored legislation like H.R. 1057, the “Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention, or “STOP” Act. Designed to stop dangerous synthetic drugs like fentanyl and carfentanil from being shipped through our borders, this legislation will combat bad actors in China and India who have been taking advantage of weaknesses in international mail security standards to break U.S. customs laws and wreak havoc on our communities.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepNewhouse/videos/652632294937500/",NA,71,65,9,4,0,1,2,4

The Committee approved report language that I worked on to ensure that rural regions like ours are treated fairly when the federal government administers disaster relief such as Public Assistance. Many rural areas in states with large population centers, like Washington, are often disadvantaged by disaster declarations and federal assistance program processes. It is important that we address the severe economic stress that can be placed on rural communities following natural disasters, such as catastrophic wildfires, and give greater weight and consideration to the impacts on areas like Central Washington.

This important bill includes funding for several of Central Washington's health priorities. First, it funds the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CHIP provides health care to lower-income children, and this bill would extend the funding for five years. Second, the bill extends funding for the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) for two additional years. This funding is used at federally qualified health centers, which provide an array of comprehensive health services to medically-underserved populations. Community health centers serve over 280,000 constituents in Washington's 4th District every year. Lastly, this bill provides funding for Teaching Health Centers, so we can continue to train primary care doctors and retain them at community-based clinics in rural areas. With three Teaching Health Centers in Central Washington, this funding is important to ensure that we have qualified, well-educated doctors providing care for families in less-populated areas.","status",NA,NA,87,40,5,4,0,0,0,0

On top of that, a confusing, complicated tax code — which at 75,000 pages is far too long for anyone who isn’t a CPA to understand — means local businesses end up wasting precious time and resources on tax preparation. Surely this money would be better spent expanding business and creating more jobs."" http://www.yakimaherald.com/opinion/editorials/guest_editorials/streamlined-tax-code-to-help-rural-washington-thrive/article_f1e047f0-d6cb-11e7-87b3-27c693b994fe.html","status",NA,NA,101,219,14,2,6,1,9,94

For thousands of DACA recipients across the nation, including 17,000 in our state, every day without a legislative solution brings more uncertainty about their future. DACA recipients should not be a political football. Rather than delaying until next year or pushing unrealistic partisan legislation that has no hope of being signed into law by the president, the right thing to do is for Congress to come together on a deal to give these young people certainty.

I was grateful for the opportunity to sit down with AWB and discuss several topics that affect Washington’s diverse economy. I heard their concerns about a broken immigration system that is not meeting the needs of employers, which is demonstrated by the shortage of highly skilled STEM and agricultural workers that are essential to American competitiveness, growth, and innovation. We also discussed infrastructure improvements that are necessary to ensure that Washington continues to be a leader in contributing to the United States’ economic success. AWB stressed the need to protect our waterways and access to ports to efficiently export our agricultural goods to market, expanding internet connectivity in rural areas, and support policies that contribute to safety and efficiency in the general aviation industry.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepNewhouse/photos/a.315863825281017.1073741828.315798208620912/722223984644997/?type=3",NA,42,40,1,1,0,0,0,2

Today, we passed the first major pro-growth, pro-family tax reform in 31 years. Doubling the standard deduction—which is used by eighty percent of filers in the Fourth Congressional District—and increasing the child tax credit will provide real relief for working families in Central Washington. Additionally, this bill is a win for small businesses and farmers by allowing them to immediately write off the full cost of new equipment and increasing those who are shielded from the unfair death tax which allows more family farms and small businesses to pass on the success of a lifetime of hard work to the next generation. We promised to remove the individual mandate, which is an unfair tax penalty that hits middle-income families in the Fourth District. With this major reform, that Obama-era burden will be removed once and for all.
