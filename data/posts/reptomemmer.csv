Many have expressed concern that their browsing history and internet data is now less secure and private than it was before. However, that is simply not the case. The legislation the House approved rolls back an Obama Administration rule – that had yet to take effect – which took advantage of Americans privacy values and instead empowers agency bureaucrats. It removes duplicative regulation and also takes the government out of the position of picking winners and losers, creating a level playing field for all internet service providers and companies. Telecommunications carriers are still obligated by law to protect confidential customer information, as they have been for over 20 years.

They are especially vital in remote, rural areas of the state. Had a great discussion with Minnesota Association of Community Health Centers - MNACHC, Open Cities Health Center, and Scenic Rivers Health Services on the importance of their role our local communities. Funding for these centers is crucial. I was proud to support the Championing Healthy Kid’s Act - a long-term solution for community health centers and Minnesotans who rely on CHIP - which the House passed in November and now awaits action in the Senate.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/reptomemmer/photos/a.783160458404947.1073741829.714180948636232/1570840186303633/?type=3",NA,20,32,1,2,0,0,2,20

The House Committee on Financial Services has been committed to this goal by passing the Financial CHOICE Act and rolling back burdensome regulations that would continue the decline of rural lending and force smaller players to close up shop. We will continue this commitment into 2018, putting Main Street first and empowering small businesses in Minnesota across America.","link","https://www.wsj.com/articles/goodbye-george-bailey-decline-of-rural-lending-crimps-small-town-business-1514219515","wsj.com",19,26,2,0,0,0,4,11
