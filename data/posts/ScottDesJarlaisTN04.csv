Iran and ISIS took control. In Mosul, as elsewhere, ISIS slaughtered the ancient Christian population, as well as many Iraqi Muslims. Without much U.S. support, the Iraqi government failed twice to retake the important city. The effort stalled and appeared lost. Not until Donald J. Trump challenged our former commander-in-chief, did President Obama commit to Mosul -- just a month before last November's election.

The fake news media will bury good news. You'll rarely hear substance, even when the American public would enjoy learning they made the right choice.

Now, under the new Trump Administration, the unemployment rate is low, but the labor force participation is surging upward.
