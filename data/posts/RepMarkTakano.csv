From 1980-2014, wages for the bottom half of America's workers were basically stagnant, while the top 1% of America experienced income growth of 205%.   Income inequality is not the inevitable result of capitalism; it is the result of policy choices we make about health care, child care, education, taxes, and other issues that affect our daily lives. Inequality is what happens when we undermine unions, strip leverage from workers, and weaken laws that protect their ability to earn a decent wage.   America’s workers deserve more than just a day off on Labor Day. They deserve an economy that gives working families a fighting chance to cover their basic expenses, save for the future, and achieve the financial stability they have earned.

That settlement was only possible because – although Walmart did not directly run the warehouse – the company’s ability to control the warehouse made them responsible for the treatment of its workers.   The legal term for this is ""joint employer."" The joint employer standard has remained unchanged for decades and helps prevent large companies like Walmart from outsourcing accountability for the laws that protect workers’ wages and ensure their right to collectively bargain for better working conditions.   At a hearing this morning, House Republicans discussed their plan to weaken the joint employer standard to such an extreme that workers would no longer have this protection. Under the bill they’ve introduced, Walmart would not have been responsible for the rights of the Mira Loma warehouse workers, and those workers would not have had the ability to recover stolen wages.   As I said during the hearing, America’s extreme income inequality is proof that our economy is rigged against the average American worker. Repealing the joint employer standard would make this problem worse by stripping workers of what little leverage they have left.   I will continue to strongly oppose this bill.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepMarkTakano/videos/1269751046487296/",NA,258,27,76,20,0,13,1,3
