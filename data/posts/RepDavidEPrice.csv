Trump's DHS is failing to humanely enforce our nation’s immigration laws without causing undue upheaval or collateral damage, leading to a surge in immigration arrests explicitly designed to tear communities apart.  Today, I offered an amendment to shift funding for these misguided enforcement activities to instead increase customs staffing at airports and ports of entry. Unfortunately, Republicans voted this reasonable proposal down. I will keep fighting to ensure that immigration enforcement prioritizes dangerous criminals rather than contributing members of society.","status",NA,NA,283,47,13,20,1,1,3,10

Despite overwhelming public opposition and a clearly corrupted comment process, the FCC, under the misguided leadership of Chairman Ajit Pai, has voted to eliminate #NetNeutrality, a decision that will erode the principles of openness, innovation, and fairness that are the cornerstone of the internet. This blatant corporate handout is yet another example of the Trump Administration’s anti-consumer agenda at work. Congress must act immediately to ensure the internet remain a free and open public platform.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/technology/net-neutrality-repeal-vote.html?_r=0","nytimes.com",65,37,31,0,1,1,15,104

Congressional App Challenge Background  The Congressional App Challenge is designed to promote STEM education by recognizing and incentivizing young talent to create a concept or source code for an online or mobile application (“app”).  Eligibility  Open to High School age students that attend school or live in the Fourth Congressional District or First Congressional District.  Students are only eligible to compete once they have signed up for the Challenge at CongressionalAppChallenge.us.  Students may only compete in one district.  Students may compete as individuals or in teams of up to four.  If competing as a team: at least two of the teammates must be eligible to compete within the district in which they are submitting.  There is no technical age minimum, but the App Challenge is intended for high school students.  Recent High School graduates are not eligible to compete.

If students are competing as part of a team, the sign-up form must include the relevant information from each student  2. App Information. Students will be asked to answer a series of questions including: title of the app, the coding language used, what they were trying to accomplish and why, an explanation of a difficulty they faced in programming and how it was overcome, and what improvements the students would make  3. Demonstration Video. Students must create a 1 to no more than 3 minute video, post it on YouTube or Vimeo, and submit the link on the Congressional App Challenge submission form. The video must be set up to public view. Videos that are longer than 3 minutes will be penalized per the judges’ discretion.
