The report makes it clear that the Russian intervention was directed by Putin himself, and was designed not only to sow discord in the United States, but was also motivated by the desire to help Donald Trump’s election chances by discrediting Secretary Hillary Clinton.  These conclusions are well-supported by the evidence and the report should put to rest any uncertainty as to Russian responsibility for this unprecedented interference in our internal affairs.   As a nation, we must resolve  to impose further consequences both public and private that will deter the Russians from seeking to undermine our democracy in the future and the report issued today will inform the thorough investigations that Congress must now undertake to ascertain the extent of what happened and how, and what steps we need to take to protect our government. “  The President-Elect’s statement that the Russian hacking had ""absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election"" is not supported by the briefing, report, or common sense.  It is one thing to say that there was no tampering with vote tallying – which is true – it is another  thing to say that the daily dumping of documents disparaging to Secretary Clinton that was made possible by Russian cyber operations had no effect on the campaigns.  The consequence of these disclosures was hugely beneficial to the President-Elect and damaging to the Clinton campaign, just as the Russians intended.  Whether they had a decisive impact on the outcome will never be known and was certainly not the subject of the intelligence community’s analysis, but that they were of great consequence is undeniable.”  Today the Congress certified the election.  This report should not be taken to re-open the election, but to make sure this never happens again.  President-Elect Trump received the same briefing congressional leaders did this morning, and I hope that he acts appropriately in the face of this clear-cut, Russian malicious activity against America.  That starts by accepting the facts.  The President-Elect must not obfuscate or distract, but deal honestly with the truth of what happened, and will continue to happen in the U.S. and against our allies, unless we put an end to it.  Russian influence operations are not only a clear danger to the United States, but to liberal democracies around the world.

I'm sad to say that after this week I can say that yes, that's exactly what they plan to do.  Our stand starts now.  On Friday, House Republicans took the first step in a process that would allow them to repeal the ACA with only Republican votes. I voted NO.  That's the bad news, but the good news is the fight is just starting. Seven years after passage of the ACA, the GOP doesn't have a plan that would come even close to insuring the millions who rely on the ACA for health care, including the 27 percent of Americans with pre-existing medical conditions that made it impossible to get insurance before the ACA.  The ACA isn't perfect and if Republicans are serious about improving it to keep down prices and reach more people, I'm ready to work with them. But health insurance is literally life and death for millions of Americans. We won't let them take it away without a fight.  Next week I'll be hosting a forum (https://www.facebook.com/events/235082330277300) to talk about what the ACA means for many of my constituents and our plans to make sure we don't turn back the clock on health care.

MLK and other leaders fought peacefully and tirelessly to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and truly begin to change the conversation and course in America.  Dr. King's work is not done. During the 2016 election season I was deeply disturbed by efforts around our country to make voting more difficult in certain communities. Individual counties and states chose to enact strict voter ID laws, restrict early voting locations and times, and sometimes provided incorrect voting times and locations online. In effect, these steps make it more difficult for certain members of the community - minorities, undereducated, and poor members of the community - to cast a ballot.  It is our duty to guarantee the rights Martin Luther King Jr. and so many other men and women fought for, and I will do so whenever disenfranchisement and voter suppression rear their ugly heads.

I want to share my thoughts on these upcoming events, even though I know many of you may disagree with my decision.   This is the first time I've ever truly considered not attending an Inauguration, both because of a foreign adversarial power's role in Donald Trump's election, and because of his deplorable conduct before and after November 7.   During the campaign, I repeatedly warned of Russia's interference in our democracy and the assistance it was giving Trump by hacking and releasing documents detrimental to Secretary Clinton. In fact, as the Ranking Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, Senator Feinstein and I took the rare step of attributing the hacks to Russia well before the Administration was willing to, and I will be helping to lead the investigation into its pernicious interference in our affairs.   Since the election, Trump has only made matters worse, continuing his denials of the extent of Russian involvement and persisting in offensive conduct that only divides the country.   There are few people I respect more than John Lewis, a hero of the civil rights movement and a man I was honored to join in a civil rights pilgrimage to the Edmund Pettis Bridge and during a sit-in on the House floor to protest inaction on gun violence.   Trump's lack of respect for Rep. Lewis and his insulting attitude towards others offends me greatly. As I have said many times, no one is doing more to undermine the legitimacy of Donald Trump's Presidency than Donald Trump.   So why go?   In my view, Congressional participation at a Presidential Inauguration is not about the President, it's about the Presidency. Yes, many in the public attend because they are pleased with the election and want to be present when their candidate is sworn in. But the reason that Congress surrounds the new President during the ceremony -- members from both parties -- is not because both parties are pleased with the result of the election. Far from it. We participate on a bipartisan basis because we are acknowledging the peaceful transition of power that is the hallmark of our democracy.   Like many of you, I was appalled when candidate Trump wouldn't commit to respecting the result of the election if he lost. I feel I would be doing the same thing if I boycotted the ceremony in which the office of the Presidency is passed from one occupant of the office to the next. There's a reason why Senators Harris and Sanders and others are attending the Inauguration, and it is out of respect for the office, even if the man who is taking the oath has demonstrated little understanding of what that means. If former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton can demonstrate the grit to attend the Inauguration after Trump's slanderous attacks on her, then so can I.  On the day following the Inauguration, I will join constituents in Washington for the Women's March and participate in another fundamental aspect of our democracy -- the right to protest. Our message that day, and every day of his Presidency will be the same: That we will not allow Trump to roll back the progress we have made, that his actions and words have consequences, that we will hold him accountable, that demeaning women, minorities and anyone who disagrees with him will not be acceptable, and that we will not be silent.  Once again, thank you for sharing your thoughts and I hope you will continue to do so.","status",NA,NA,814,489,102,53,2,5,66,42

As one of the first California Democrats to endorse him, I was particularly active in his campaign in South Carolina and other early states.     I was drawn to Obama's campaign by the optimism of his message, by his call for change and his inspiring words. I believed he could be a transformational President, and that his election would be profoundly positive for the country. In this, as in just about everything else, Barack Obama would exceed my high expectations.   My appreciation for President Obama deepened the more I had the chance to work and interact with him while he was in the White House.  I want to tell you about one of those experiences.   Two years ago, Congress was in the midst of a heated debate over national security and privacy. In particular, we were debating the telephone metadata program in which vast amounts of domestic call data were collected, although without any personally identifiable information. There was no evidence that the program had been abused, yet many Americans were rightly concerned about government access to this information and the potential for abuse in the future. At the same time, others argued that this database might prevent attacks against the United States by allowing the government to quickly run a terror suspect's number and see if they were in contact with any Americans.   President Obama invited me to join him for a discussion of the issue at the White House, since I was a senior member of the Intelligence Committee who had been very active in calling for a reform of the program. My position was that the program should be restructured so that the phone companies retained their customers metadata rather than the government, and in the event of an emergency the government could obtain what they needed with court approval.   In discussing the issue with the President, I admired the way his mind worked, the strong intellect he brought to the task, the respectful way he asked us questions, and the demanding nature of his analytical process. Ultimately, the President concurred with my view (how could I not think he was brilliant) and our meeting was the first step towards drafting the USA Freedom Act, which ended the telephone metadata program as it was then constituted. It was a rare win for both privacy and security – a challenging balance to strike – and due in part to the direct advocacy and conversation started by the President.  I will miss President Obama when he leaves office this week, and I think the country will too. His accomplishments are impossible to ignore – saving our nation's economy at a time of great peril, passing the Affordable Care Act, protecting DREAMers from unjust and unwise deportations, putting in place agreements and regulations to protect our planet against climate change, just to name a few.  I did not agree with the President on everything – we differed on the handling of cyber-hacking, Ukraine, Syria, the Armenian Genocide among other important matters – but I respect the dignity he brought to the office and maintained throughout his entire tenure in the Oval Office.   I also admire the way the President and First Lady raised such a beautiful family in that most watched of fish bowls. If there was ever a President who demonstrated family values, it was this one, and Michelle was every bit as inspirational to millions of Americans.   So, to quote some of the President's noisiest detractors, #ThanksObama.  I will forever be proud to have worked on your campaign and to have had the honor of serving with you. Farewell.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepAdamSchiff/photos/a.333775801830.159007.9086721830/10154035098481831/?type=3",NA,486,56,26,92,0,1,11,0

He may be taking the weekend off, but for the rest of us, the fight to preserve all of the progress we have made over the last eight years begins right now.  We will fight to protect the Affordable Care Act and the millions of people who now have access to quality healthcare for the first time.

This week, I heard from the people who make that tourism possible – representatives from our hotels, airports, cities, museums and tourist hotspots.   The uncertainty caused by President Trump's travel ban is having a real effect on our nation's tourism. While travel to the U.S. has increased steadily in the past, many now project it to fall.

That millions would lose their access to care, merited not even a mention.  On immigration, and much like his dark nomination speech, he once again cast those who come to the country in search of a better life as likely murderers and rapists. He showed no appreciation for how immigrants have enriched this nation of immigrants.  The President talked about the need to decrease conflict around the world, but has proposed slashing diplomacy and development. He talked about allowing displaced persons to return home, yet he closed the borders to refugees fleeing the worst violence. He talked of promoting clean air and water, yet installed an EPA Administrator who worked to undermine both.

America must speak strongly and plainly about the facts of the Armenian Genocide and denounce all crimes against humanity, if we are to live up to our moral and historic responsibility. I joined Rep. Trott and other colleagues in the Caucus on Armenian Issues in introducing bipartisan legislation to officially recognize the Armenian Genocide. As our resolution makes clear, we cannot take a principled stand against modern day genocides like those carried out by ISIS against religious minorities in Iraq and Syria if we are to pick and choose which horrors to recognize, or shrink from our responsibility because it might alienate friend or foe.","link","http://schiff.house.gov/news/press-releases/schiff-trott-introduce-bipartisan-resolution-to-recognize-armenian-genocide","schiff.house.gov",1703,123,321,102,0,7,60,1

In the days following last November 8, I heard from thousands of my constituents, many of whom were deeply alarmed by President Trump’s election and where the country was headed. I noted my own opposition to many of the positions that then President-elect Trump voiced during the campaign, and my deep concern about his temperament and discipline.  Nonetheless, I think we all hoped that the President would grow into the job, and we wanted -- and needed -- our President to be successful. We hoped that he would not only reach out to his own base, but also to the millions of Americans who opposed his election, and reassure them that he would be a President for everyone.  After the first one hundred days, many of these hopes have, sadly, proven unjustified. President Trump has pursued an extreme agenda at almost every opportunity, from an unconstitutional Muslim Ban, to a proposed budget that would decimate the EPA, the State Department, and many other agencies, to policies that undermine our work combatting climate change, to a wall on our southern border, to the still-continuing effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut Medicaid in order to finance an enormous tax cut benefiting corporations and the wealthy.  Equally concerning, has been the seemingly carelessness way in which the President makes inflammatory or false statements -- claiming first that millions of undocumented immigrants voted and deprived him of a popular victory, and later that President Obama was engaged in an illegal wiretapping operation aimed at Trump tower.   But most troubling have been the times when the President does not seem to understand or appreciate our system of checks and balances, when he declares a free press the enemy of the people, or questions the legitimacy of federal judges because they are doing their constitutional duty.  And the cavalier way the President talks about using military force only heightens the need for Congress to do its job and repeal the open-ended war authorizations passed after 9/11.   This week, in an interview looking back on the first 100 days of his Administration, the President said, “I thought it would be easier.” And while I appreciate this rare moment of introspection, I fear that the stresses of that job will only accentuate some of the President's character traits that we have all found sound concerning.  There have been many days in the last 100 when it felt like the foundation of our democracy was being tested. But I want to tell you that I am confident we will pass that test. The fact that so  many Americans have become active and energized, attending marches and townhalls, writing letters, protesting and even just speaking out -- give me great confidence in the resiliency of our system. Whether you agree with the President or not, I find it inspiring that so many people are engaged and paying attention.  The first 100 days were an exhausting whirlwind. The next hundred are just as important.  Please stay active, keep thinking about how you can help make this a stronger and better community and nation, and keep reaching out to let me know what you think.","status",NA,NA,1574,286,324,180,4,0,56,7

I wanted to take a moment to tell you why:   In March, Speaker Ryan pulled the American Health Care Act (AHCA) from a vote due to an overwhelming backlash against the bill, since it would leave 24 million Americans uninsured, cut essential health benefits, raise costs, and provide tax breaks for the wealthy. The new bill - with its concessions to the extreme Tea Party wing - is even worse.   What did the GOP change? It kept the same, counterproductive policies in the bill and added an amendment that allows states to discriminate against the 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. That actually won MORE support from the House Majority.  To avoid additional public outcry, the GOP drafted this bill behind closed doors and rushed it to the House Floor without a score from the non-partisan CBO. This bill is not a fix. It is, quite literally, a matter of life and death to the millions of Americans that rely on the ACA for access to life-saving healthcare.  So yes, House Republicans took a step towards repealing Obamacare. But they did so at the expense of their constituents - recklessly playing with the lives of the American people.   Today’s passage of this bill is a huge step backwards from the progress we’ve made since the ACA was signed into law. It is clear, now more than ever, that the fight to ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare is far from over.   And I assure you, I will keep fighting.

After months in which the Congress had been consumed by debate about repealing the Affordable Care Act, members of both parties are now working on improving the ACA and constraining healthcare costs. This is a very positive development and one that all Americans should welcome, because it means that the chance of improving the healthcare system just got a lot better, and millions of Americans won't be losing their coverage.  Getting to this point wasn't easy.  Since January, several versions of a repeal have been brought to a vote in the House and Senate. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, each of those “health care” bills would have caused tens of millions of Americans to lose their insurance, severely jeopardizing both their health and long-term economic security.  It’s been a frustrating process, because if we had started out by having a real conversation about how we can make changes to the Affordable Care Act to improve quality, affordability, and access to care, I truly believe we could have worked out bipartisan solutions a long time ago. There is no question that healthcare under the ACA can be improved, particularly in the individual market, but instead of exploring such reforms, the GOP leadership in the House and Senate undertook an unprecedented and closed process to push through a bill without hearings, amendments, or real substantive debate.  Last month, the most recent Republican attempt to repeal the ACA failed passage in the Senate by a 51-49 vote. If the so-called “skinny repeal” had passed, it would have stripped insurance from 15 million Americans and caused premiums to skyrocket. In a logic that could only make sense in Washington, most Republican Senators actually feared that their own bill could become law. They acknowledged that the bill would wreak havoc on insurance markets, and said they would only vote yes if they were guaranteed it would never be enacted. Other versions of the bill were even worse and would have kicked over 20 million off their care.  I was relieved that this most recent push for repeal fell short (thanks to the leadership of Republican Senators Collins, Murkowski and McCain, and the entire Democratic Caucus in the Senate), and grateful for the many Americans around the nation who spoke up about what access to affordable healthcare meant to them. The stakes are much too high to simply pass something, anything, without consideration of the consequences.   After each legislative failure, President Trump doubled down on his threat to “let Obamacare implode,” but in reality, it was the President who was doing all he could to sabotage the health insurance that millions of Americans count on. He was doing this by creating uncertainty in the markets, threatening to end cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments which forces insurance companies to dramatically raise premiums (20 percent or more immediately), and cutting off marketing to young people so that the risk pools are older and more expensive.   Ensuring that every American has access to quality, affordable health care should not be a partisan issue. The good news is that there is bipartisan support for continuing the CSR payments, while simultaneously making changes that improve the ACA and stabilize the individual markets. In the House, members from both sides of the aisle are working together to improve and strengthen the markets. This is a good start, but we are not out of the woods yet. The President is continuing to take action to undermine the ACA even as members of both parties now work to improve it, and it is still unclear if the House Leadership will allow such efforts to gain traction through hearings, legislative markup and real debate.    The Affordable Care Act isn't perfect, but it expanded access to affordable healthcare for millions, and started to lower the rapid clip at which healthcare costs had been escalating.  Healthcare costs are still too great, but there are steps we can take that won't start us back at the beginning. Our end goal must be universal healthcare for each and every single American.  As always, I welcome hearing and really value your thoughts.","status",NA,NA,727,93,43,60,0,4,1,0

These trips have taken us up the Pacific Coast Highway, through our national parks, in an RV, and on Amtrak sleeper trains through the Northwest. This year, we decided to do something on a different scale. We flew to France, rented a car, and made our way to the beaches of Normandy.   On June 6th, 73 years ago, 160,000 allied troops stormed the beaches of Normandy on D-Day. Tens of thousands boarded boats and landing craft in rough seas to cross the English Channel, knowing they were sailing into the teeth of a fortified Nazi stronghold. We were keenly aware that among the many thousands on those boats crossing the channel in the dark of night were young men only a few years older than Eli.    Each year, the unimaginable devastation and scale of World War II and the Holocaust fades further into history, as more and more of the Greatest Generation pass away. While we can learn about it in history books or see it in movies, seeing the rows upon rows of crosses and the occasional Star of David marking the graves of the fallen, the impact is deep and visceral. But for providence and the sacrifices made in service of freedom and humanity, the world might be a very different place.   Standing on those hallowed beaches of Normandy, with the reminders of what it took to beat back the Nazism’s supremacist ideology all around us, it was all the more disturbing to see images from back home where white supremacist protestors were chanting “Blood and Soil,” displaying Swastikas and marching with torches in Charlottesville. Are we now so far removed from the enormous sacrifice that was made to defeat such pernicious ideas of racial supremacy that once again bigotry and racism creep forward, this time from dark corners of the Internet or KKK rallies and back into the public square? This must not be.   Political debates, even angry ones, are a part of any democracy, and the United States is no exception. But there are shared values which are not up for debate, and above all others is the simple truth that all of us are created equal. Our nation’s history with race and equality has been a painful and bloody one, but it has also been characterized by halting progress towards living up to our higher ideals. When ideologies that divide us by race or religion or declare others less than fully human find a foothold in our political life, silence is not an option. Hatred and racism are a cancer and they must be confronted at every turn, and it is better to do so early before it can metastasize into something worse. The cemetery in Normandy is a solemn testimony to that fact.   I hope that Charlottesville and the tragic murder of Heather Heyer who was killed in an act of hatred and terror, will be a wakeup call, and that leaders across the political spectrum rise to combat the resurgence of this hateful ideology.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepAdamSchiff/photos/a.333775801830.159007.9086721830/10154601523736831/?type=3",NA,3283,341,690,637,1,11,244,1

It’s hard to find the words each time one of these shootings take place. They’re massacres, they’re terror attacks of one kind or another, and they've also become so tragically common.   It’s entirely appropriate in the early hours after a tragedy to offer thoughts, prayers and condolences.  If this shooting happened in our community, we would hope the entire nation would join in our grief and our sorrow, much as they did after San Bernardino.  But that is not enough. The simple fact is that rote expressions of sadness or regret following mass shootings and the daily tide of gun violence in our nation does nothing to save the life of the next American to be cut down by this plague.   But we are not powerless to do something about the epidemic of mass shootings. Yes, we cannot stop them all, but we can prevent some of them and those we cannot prevent, we can make less lethal. The fact that no single solution will stop every single attack is not a reason to do nothing.   We can improve mental health treatment, since mental illness is often a factor. We can crack down on terrorist recruitment online. And we can enact common sense gun safety reforms including universal background checks, legislation to restore the Assault Weapons Ban and limit the capacity of ammunition clips. Each of us in Congress – Democrat and Republican – should be recommitting ourselves to do what we can do to prevent and mitigate these terrible attacks.   That was true after the massacre at the Pulse nightclub, which was barely more than a year ago. At the time, it was the deadliest mass shooting in American history. Not any more. It was true when 26 young children and teachers were slaughtered at Sandy Hook Elementary School. It was true in Blacksburg when a shooter killed 32 people on Virginia Tech’s campus. And it is true day after day with more than 30,000 Americans dying each year by gunshot, many that receive little more than a mention in the news.    I’m reminded of what President Obama said after the tragedy at Newtown: “We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years. And each time I learn the news, I react not as a President, but as anybody else would: as a parent. And that was especially true today. I know there's not a parent in America who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that I do.”   Today, we mourn yet another mass shooting; tomorrow, we must refuse to accept the blood soaked streets of Las Vegas as an immutable fact of life in our nation. We must refuse to accept the idea that we are powerless to save the lives of our fellow Americans. And we must rededicate ourselves to do more than mourn the dead, but to fight to save the living.","status",NA,NA,1390,171,241,144,0,1,203,8

I’m introducing legislation to eliminate PLCAA, a law that shields the entire gun industry from lawsuit even when it acts with disregard for public safety. Congress gave the gun lobby this immunity — something no other industry enjoys —when it passed PLCAA in 2005, in what the NRA called its “number one priority.”  If an American is harmed by the negligent conduct of others, they have the right to hold any culpable manufacturer, dealer or trade association responsible. Not so, for those in the gun industry. If a gun dealer sells a weapon to someone who uses it to commit a crime, they are not liable for the conduct of others simply because they sold the gun, any more than a convenience store is liable for the sole act of selling beer to someone who later engages in drunk driving. But where a convenience store negligently sells alcohol to minors, they are not immune from responsibility. If the gun dealer is negligent and sells the weapon to someone they know or have reason to know will use it illegally, why should they be held to a different standard than everyone else? Victims of gun violence and their families deserve their day in court, too.","link","http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-las-vegas-mass-shooting-bump-stock-20171005-story.html","latimes.com",959,110,123,61,2,4,57,37

When the Iran nuclear deal was voted on by Congress in 2015, I was cognizant that it was not a perfect agreement. I was particularly concerned about the eventual sunset of the limits on Iranian enrichment capacity. I was aware that while we could hope that the deal would signal a new opening to the West, strengthen the hand of the moderate faction in Iran, and over time temper Iran’s malevolent behavior, such an outcome was not guaranteed.    However my judgment then was that the deal did one singularly important thing – it verifiably cut off Iran's path to a nuclear weapon and extended their breakout time beyond a year, rather than a few weeks or months. I also understood that the crippling sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place could not be maintained indefinitely and that if the United States walked away from the agreement, the international sanctions regime may well have crumbled, leaving Iran with many of the benefits of the JCPOA without the cost of heightened inspections and limited enrichment capacity.   It is with that backdrop that I evaluate the President's announcement that he will not certify to Congress that Iran is in compliance with the JCPOA. The decision to decertify is not based on a material breach of the JCPOA, as the Administration acknowledges that Iran remains in compliance. It was not based on the counsel of the President's senior national security team, as both Secretary Mattis and General Dunford have made clear their belief that in the absence of a breach, the President should provide certification to Congress. It appears it is simply based on the President's anger that he must certify that the JCPOA is working as intended, when he so often claimed the contrary without any factual basis.    Among the many destructive and dangerous aspects of this decision is sowing further doubt that the United States will live up to its international commitments. If other nations do not believe that we will abide by our agreements, how can we credibly negotiate a diplomatic settlement to the North Korean crisis?    The failure to certify triggers a 60 day period in which Congress can reinstate nuclear sanctions against Iran under expedited procedures. However, in the absence of a breach, Congress should not take any action which would be contrary to our commitments under the JCPOA. Instead, Congress should endeavor to do what the President failed to do – abide by the JCPOA, uphold America's global leadership role and credibility, and develop a strategy to counter Iranian influence and malevolence in non-nuclear areas.   The President presented a list of the Iranian regime’s misdeeds – and there are many. What he did not provide is a coherent strategy to counter them, despite proclaiming a grand new approach. It would behoove the President and Congress to consider how much more difficult countering Iranian influence would be if the nuclear deal had not verifiably cut off their path to becoming a nuclear power.","status",NA,NA,838,170,199,23,3,10,98,97

Senator Feinstein and I just introduced the Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act which would add more than 191,000 acres to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, stretching from the Simi Hills and Santa Susanas to the Verdugos and on to the San Gabriel Mountains.  The Rim of the Valley is the critical bridge between the urban city centers, suburbs in the Los Angeles basin and the spectacular wilderness beyond. As more of this area is developed and open space diminishes, the wildlife it supports is increasingly at risk. Congress must preserve the Rim of the Valley for generations to come, but we must act quickly on a bipartisan basis, or this once in a century opportunity will be gone.

It has long been reported that the dossier began as opposition research for a GOP candidate and was later adopted by a democratic candidate; this new report provides greater detail on the latter. But regardless of who funded this research, the most important question is whether the allegations in the dossier are true. Some of Christopher Steele’s dossier has been corroborated, and other parts are still under investigation. By working only to discredit the dossier or its author, some of my colleagues are losing sight of the aim of the investigation: getting to the bottom of what the Russians did, how they interfered in our election, and how we must protect our elections in the future:","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepAdamSchiff/videos/10154773621476831/",NA,971,168,173,96,9,21,1,10

A true tax reform plan will require real tradeoffs and hard, but overdue discussions between both parties about how to put us on a sustainable fiscal path. We all want tax policies that benefit the middle class and boost our economy, and we should endeavor to negotiate something that lowers taxes on small businesses, simplifies the tax code, and gets rid of special interest loopholes that allow many companies to pay no taxes at all while others pay a high rate.  Unfortunately, from what we know thus far of the tax proposals presented by the Administration, the current plan would result in higher taxes for millions of middle class families and cut taxes for large companies and special interests by borrowing more money and putting the nation further into debt. In fact, these combined tax cuts would increase the federal debt by $2.4 trillion in the first ten years and cost an additional $3.2 trillion in the second decade.   Since I came to office in 2001, a combination of tax cuts, wars, growth in health care spending, and economic downturns have brought our national debt to over $20 trillion, with no end in sight. This current tax proposal would only widen deficits, damaging our nation’s long-term fiscal stability.   The one proposal that has been offered to offset the increased deficit is ending or limiting the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction – a tax break that allows individuals to deduct their state and local taxes paid from income when filing a federal tax return. In California, nearly 6 million residents claimed the deduction, and nearly 84% of those who claimed it earned less than $200,000 in annual household income. Elimination of this deduction would result in a massive tax increase on middle class families in countless states throughout the country. I've joined many members of both parties in urging those drafting this legislation to exclude this provision.    A tax reform should simplify the tax code, make sure everyone pays a fair share - rather than have some companies and individuals pay little or no tax while the rest of us pay more - and be fiscally sound. This initial plan does not meet any of those standards, and it is certainly not the comprehensive “tax reform” plan that the President promised. I hope that Congress and the President can get to work on a real tax reform, rather than a bill that punishes middle class families in states like ours, and worsens the long term fiscal health of our nation.   I look forward to hearing what you think.","status",NA,NA,447,112,101,8,1,6,31,26

Those lost and injured in the latest mass shooting, their families and friends, are in our thoughts, and we mourn with them. But thoughts and prayers are not enough -- and the refrain of ""thoughts and prayers"" is too often used as a cover for inaction. We cannot let that be. Yesterday, President Trump said it was too soon to discuss measures to decrease gun violence. ""We are not going to talk about that today,” he said. It's another all-too-common refrain, used to hide unwillingness to act and fear of the NRA.  No one bill or executive action will be a panacea that can prevent all mass shootings, but we can prevent some of them, and those we cannot prevent, we can make less lethal. And the simple fact that no one solution will stop every mass shooting is not an excuse for inaction.  If the Speaker had any political courage, we could bring up bills tomorrow on the House Floor that would help stop these tragedies. We could begin to tackle mental health issues. We could restore the Assault Weapons Ban, limit ammunition clips and make background checks universal. We could outlaw bump stocks and other devises that make assault weapons even more lethal.

Here's why:   I support a tax reform that would simplify the tax code and ease the burden on the middle class and small businesses, and one that would be revenue neutral and not increase the deficit. But that was not the bill before us. Republicans and President Trump have billed this as a “tax reform” bill. It’s not. It won’t simplify the tax code or ensure everyone pays their fair share.   It’s a tax shift. It drastically cuts taxes for the wealthy and corporations, and pays for it by raising taxes on millions of middle and working class households, and by adding trillions to the national debt. If you’re in the middle class, there is a one–in–three chance that you are among the 36 million Americans that will have their taxes RAISED as a result of this bill.    To offset the cost of cutting the tax rate for corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent, and eliminating the estate tax on estates worth over $11 million, Republicans are eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes and limiting the deduction for mortgage interest. For millions of Californians, that will mean an immediate hike in their taxes. Corporations, on the other hand, will be allowed to continue to deduct their state and local taxes. And while the lower corporate rate is permanent, the decreased tax rates for individual filers phase out, so just a few years down the road, millions will be looking at a tax hike, while corporations continue to enjoy a lower rate.   And it doesn’t stop there. While it maintains tax loopholes for corporations and the wealthy, it eliminates many small deductions that make a big difference for ordinary Americans. Currently, teachers can deduct the cost of buying school supplies for their classroom – something many do out of their own pocket to make sure their students have notebooks and pencils. This bill would eliminate that. It would eliminate the deduction for moving expenses if you relocate for a new job. All you need to know about the bill is contained in the fact that if you are a student paying student loans back, your taxes will go up as that deduction goes away, and that will help pay for the elimination of the estate tax.    When the GOP started talking about tax reform, they said they wanted to pass a bill that was deficit neutral and wouldn’t add to our national debt, which already exceeds $20 trillion. But this bill would add $1.7 trillion to the debt in the first decade, and trillions more thereafter. After years of railing against the growing debt, it’s the height of hypocrisy to put forward such an irresponsible bill.   I would like to say that the bill will get better in the Senate, but that looks unlikely. The Senate is now proposing to make this a bill not just about cutting taxes, but also about repealing the Affordable Care Act, eliminating a key provision of the ACA that would lead to 13 million Americans losing insurance and millions more paying higher premiums.  Republicans could have learned from the mistakes of their healthcare repeal effort when they drafted a partisan bill behind closed doors and tried to ram it through. But they didn’t. Instead, they’re doing it again to pass a tax cut that will benefit corporations and the wealthy – people like the President – at the expense of everyone else. I will continue to oppose this bill and speak out for as long as it takes.","status",NA,NA,1904,240,225,159,4,6,10,64

Flynn was not a minor player, but a senior member of the Trump campaign, Trump transition and Trump White House. His secret discussion with Kislyak — in which he urged the Russians not to overreact to the sanctions just placed on their country by the Obama Administration — must be viewed in this important context: The Russians had just intervened in our election to assist the Trump campaign.   It’s also clear from the plea that Flynn wasn’t acting as a rogue agent, but with the knowledge and at the direction of people who were senior members of the transition team, and likely ended up as part of the Administration. Perhaps most significantly, I believe that the limited scope of the charge Flynn plead to means that Robert Mueller must have concluded he was getting a lot of value in terms of General Flynn's cooperation with respect to even more significant officials.

Here's why:   Since their failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Trump and Republicans in Congress have desperately sought a legislative accomplishment — a ""win"" to show voters that with control of both the House and Senate and the Presidency, they could get something done.    Today, in the headlong pursuit of something, anything that they could point to as a legislative success, they passed a massive tax cut for the wealthy that they would like to portray as ""tax reform."" But this “win” comes as a terrible loss for the country. It is, in fact, a gift to GOP wealthy sponsors and lives up to none of the GOP promises about helping the middle class or simplifying the tax code. Instead, it is a highly partisan bill that was rushed through both chambers and benefits few families more than the President’s own.   I voted no on this bill because, simply put, it overwhelmingly benefits large corporations and families with large incomes and estates, while doing little for most families, especially those in California. This bill particularly hurts middle class families in states like mine, millions of which will get a whopping tax increase since their ability to deduct state and local taxes is reduced, along with the mortgage interest deduction.   The bill also repeals a key provision in the Affordable Care Act, which will lead to 13 million Americans losing insurance and millions more paying higher premiums. In other words, for any family or individual that may see a tax break, they’ll most likely be using that money to pay for higher healthcare costs.   To make matters worse, the $1.46 trillion cost to this bill will trigger massive automatic program cuts to social safety net programs like Medicare and Social Security. There is little doubt that having increased the deficit by trillions with this bill, Republicans will seek to pay back that money through such cuts to Medicare and Social Security. That is the other shoe which is now set to fall on middle class and working families.    President Trump promised a “giant tax cut for Christmas,” and there's no question he delivered that – for himself and other real estate developers who can now use pass through income to great personal advantage and reward.    The great shame in all of this is that none of it is necessary. There was nothing precluding bipartisan legislation that would simplify the tax code, assist the middle class and small businesses and diminish our national debt. Nothing except a decision by the majority to railroad through a deceptive measure for their wealthy patrons instead.","status",NA,NA,2013,321,329,208,14,5,63,193
