I have spent years working to reform the VA's outdated benefits appeals process. Today Congress sent it to the president's desk during a pro forma session.   The legislation is based on H.R. 5083, the VA Appeals Modernization Act of 2016, which I authored as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs of the House Veterans Affairs Committee.  With the passage of this bill, our nation will finally modernize a snarled system that’s only had one major update since it was first developed in 1933. I have been fighting for more than four years to reform this process and am thankful that the framework I first proposed will become law.   Together with the VA, Veterans Service Organizations, and other lawmakers, we were able to find a bipartisan compromise to ensure that veterans in Southern Nevada and throughout the country receive the benefits they so bravely earned in a timely fashion.  BACKGROUND There are more than 460,000 veterans stuck in an appeals backlog waiting for a decision on benefits claims. The average wait time is longer than two years and would have ballooned to a decade if Congress had not passed these reforms.  The VA estimates that the framework drafted by Rep. Titus will significantly decrease wait times for veterans filing appeals.","status",NA,NA,112,24,11,10,3,0,0,0

Since 2012, DACA has helped more than 13,000 DREAMers in the state go to school, build careers, and strengthen our community. Now they will be forced into the shadows. This is a disastrous mistake that will cost Nevada’s GDP hundreds of millions per year and the federal government billions to deport DREAMers. Republicans have spent the better part of a decade avoiding votes on bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform and bills I have co-sponsored to protect immigrant families.
