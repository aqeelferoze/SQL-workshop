International family planning programs are very important for fostering manageable and healthy families around the world. By supporting international family planning efforts, we can help families around the world avoid extreme poverty, lack of access to health care, educational, and economic opportunities. Even without this step backwards, U.S. funds are already prohibited from being used to perform or promote abortion services abroad by the Helms Amendment to the 1973 U.S. Foreign Assistance Act.

Building unnecessary walls, attacking local law enforcement by threatening grant funding, demanding costly mass deportation, and damaging relationships with international partners is misguided and reprehensible. Instead, we must have a clear, humane and legal way for those who seek to come to our country to flee violence and instability, or seek new opportunities, to build a better life in the United States.  I agree that a secure border is important for our national security. Contrary to the inflammatory rhetoric that President Trump chose to espouse during his campaign, our southern border is more secure today than it has been in decades. From 2006 to 2016, the United States drastically increased our border security budget, which has contributed to the fact that we have had zero net immigration from Mexico for the last three years. The United States has taken responsibility for our border security, and any claims that Mexico should or will pay for a wall is not only foolish but illustrates the President's disturbing ignorance when it comes to foreign affairs.   I am dedicated to fixing our immigration system. A comprehensive solution must include immediate changes to our inhumane and costly private immigration detention facilities that lack proper safety oversight. Allowing immigrants to become productive members of our society will only strengthen our communities, our economy, and our country's future. I applaud our region’s local mayors and Governor Jay Inslee for stating clearly that Washington state will remain a safe haven for those in search of safety. Our local leaders understand that maintaining safe communities and protecting the rights of recent immigrants are do not conflict with one another.   In Congress, I have strongly advocated for deportation relief, reforms to our immigration detention policies, and for comprehensive immigration reform that provides justice and equity for all people, regardless of where they were born.

Adam Smith","2017-01-27","2017-01-27 01:39:26","President Trump has failed to show that he understands the difference between a presidential campaign and the serious business of governing. To solve the challenging problems the President will undoubtedly face, he should review the facts, as well as engage in pragmatic conversation and thoughtful debate. President Trump’s current approach to governance, reliant on gimmicks and sound bites, seems doomed to fail from the beginning.  Any successful government or business leader understands that forcing indiscriminate cuts and hiring freezes on no merits-- other than to fulfill a misguided campaign promise-- is the wrong approach. This across-the-board hiring freeze only serves to undermine the efficiency and effectiveness of our Federal government, create uncertainty for our economy, and impose untold impacts on both Washington state and the country.  This incredibly short-sighted move to bar federal hiring will have an enormous impact on the care of our nation’s veterans, denying them access to essential care and resources. As recently as this past fall, the Department of Veterans Affairs had a staggering 45,000 job openings nationwide. With an average of more than 20 veterans taking their own lives each day, President Trump has decided to slam the door shut on critical mental health care providers, physicians, and other staff from being hired to help former service members get the care they need. The VA Puget Sound Healthcare System in Seattle is not spared from this, and is still without a permanent director for the foreseeable future.  This rash move is an embarrassment.  As if to justify the freeze, the Trump Administration has alluded to a dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years. In reality, the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms a very different set of facts. In December 2016, there were 2.8 million employees on the federal payroll. This is a 3 percent increase since May 2014. In comparison, the total civilian workforce, excluding federal employees, grew by about 4.9 percent between May 2014 and December 2016. In truth, the number of federal employees is approximately the same now, 2.8 million, as the number when President Barack Obama took office, 2.79 million. Even under the Administration of Republican President Ronald Reagan, federal employment never dipped as low as it is today. Mr. Trump should check the veracity of his talking points.  https://adamsmith.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-smith-statement-on-president-trump-s-indiscriminate-federal","status",NA,NA,348,69,51,16,0,4,10,7

Aside from the fact that the United States already has a very extensive vetting process for refugees, the White House's failure to issue guidance for the Department of Homeland Security, airport employees and airlines across the world is causing chaos, fear, and potentially irreparable harm to our international alliances. Legal scholars are already raising serious legal questions about whether the President's ban is even constitutional.    In directing the Department of Homeland Security to indefinitely deny Syrian refugees from entering the United States, as well as callously barring all refugees from the rest of the world for a minimum of 120 days, the President has chosen to act in direct contrast to our nation’s proud history of helping those in need. The fact remains that there have been no fatal terror attacks in the United States by immigrants from the seven nations identified in the President's executive order.   Mr. Trump's disturbing lack of knowledge of the current vetting processes and his complete disregard for American values is both disturbing and dangerous. If we are to succeed in the fight against Islamic extremists, we must make it clear that our fight is not against the Muslim religion. We need our Muslim allies now, perhaps more than ever.

The executive order related to regulation signed this week is just another gimmick under the guise of reducing regulations. It arbitrarily requires that for every regulation passed, two have to be eliminated. This would wreak havoc on our regulatory system and hurt American businesses that are faced with an unpredictable and unsound regulatory environment. The very first indication that this order was alarmingly unclear and confusing is that the White House itself had to quickly issue a subsequent clarification to explain that independent agencies were exempt from it.  I support a regulatory environment that focuses on the long term needs of our country, protects the American people from harmful environmental impacts, financial fraud, and unethical labor practices, while allowing us to transform our economy and create the jobs needed to compete globally in the future.  A well-functioning agency rulemaking process is critical to that goal.

Recently, I had the privilege to honor Elie’s contributions to the Jewish-American community by submitting a letter of remembrance to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum tribute to Elie. His memory lives on through his countless books that depict his childhood experiences with the Holocaust.

I am glad he made such a strong statement, but the rest of his speech returned to the old empty promises that offer almost no specifics for how he might achieve the goals laid out in his lofty rhetoric.   I am unconvinced that now five weeks into his term, President Trump has a sufficient understanding of the challenges that working families face. We must create broad-based opportunities for all, not just the wealthiest.   The President’s Budget blueprint released this week shows a disturbing disconnect from facts and fiscal responsibility. The proposed budget would destroy critical services and investments to American families, local communities, and endanger our national security. These catastrophic cuts will hurt the progress our country has made.   As Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee, I know that the President’s budget proposal and his policies are irresponsible and threaten our national security. The reported cuts to diplomacy and development – key pillars that are critical to supporting our national security – will make Americans less safe, harm our standing around the world, and feed the anti-American narrative of terrorist groups like Daesh.  President Trump's reckless, ignorant understanding of world affairs is placing our country in jeopardy.   I am proud to represent a district in a state with a long history of opening its doors and providing equal opportunity to those seeking a safe haven and a chance at a better life. We are a nation of immigrants and refugees, and that our diversity continues to make us stronger. Immigration is not an obstacle, but rather an opportunity that enriches our society, fuels our economic competitiveness, and helps to create additional American jobs by attracting needed workers, high-skilled entrepreneurs, and investors. Our immigration laws must be reformed in a constructive and humane manner, which keeps families together and is consistent with American values.   I have heard from thousands of constituents in the district I represent about their deep concerns with the direction President Trump has taken our country in his first month in office. I myself remain deeply concerned with the attacks on our American values that we are seeing come from our highest political office. Moving forward, I will continue to work with my colleagues to fight for policies that protect our working families, provide for good-paying jobs, preserves our environment for future generations, and brings our country together.","status",NA,NA,280,33,21,25,1,0,2,7

Adam Smith","2017-03-14","2017-03-14 22:11:21","I have been a strong supporter of the State of Israel and a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinian territories for a long time.  I believe our partnership with Israel and its people is critical and in our national security interests.  I have been troubled by the lack of progress on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, from the unresolved and unhelpful settlements and lack of recognition of Israel's right to exist, to the violence that has taken innocent lives on both sides and has unfortunately set back the path towards peace.  For the Israelis and Palestinians to reach a lasting peace, we must have persistent, high-level U.S. engagement with both Israel and the Palestinians in order to build such peace and arrive at a two state solution.  I also believe that both Israelis and Palestinians have the right to live in peace and security.  Since its creation in 1948, Israel has been under constant threat of attack. It is critical that we continue to support Israel’s qualitative military edge and ability to defend itself.  I am also sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians and believe that, in order for there to be long-term security and peace in the region; they too must have a state of their own. I know that the overwhelming majority of the people in Israel and Palestine want to live and raise their families in peace.  The only way to reach a two state solution is for Israel and the Palestinian people to directly negotiate and reach an agreement together.   It is for those reasons, that I am troubled by and oppose the nomination of Mr. David Friedman to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel.

The tax proposal released today by President Trump would be disastrous.  Its almost singular focus on cutting taxes for wealthy people and companies will harm working people and undermine a healthy economy.  It is deeply hypocritical for Republicans to have claimed for years that responsible budgets and limiting deficits matter, only to now support excessive and unpaid-for tax cuts. If spurring economic growth was as easy as cutting taxes, our economy would have grown considerably more in the past 16 years, following the Bush tax cuts.   The revenues generated by our tax system directly fund our government and its efforts to care for our fellow Americans, keep our country safe, and invest in the future through education, housing, research, defense, infrastructure, and other priorities.  This plan drastically reduces revenues and will devastate government and programs in all areas, explode budget deficits, and risk destroying our economy.

No one—especially not those Republicans who voted to pass it—bothered to consider the costs or the actual impacts of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) on working Americans, those with pre-existing conditions, and people who rely on Medicare and Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was by no means a cure to all of our healthcare challenges, but today’s bill ignores any opportunity for meaningful changes, and instead represents a dangerous leap backwards.  Prior to the 2010 enactment of the ACA, health care costs were rapidly increasing, government budgets were straining under health costs, and many patients, including those with pre-existing conditions, were unable to access affordable health coverage. We simply cannot revert to a system that allows costs to increase unchecked, insures too few, and drains our economy.

It comes as Comey is in the midst of an investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russian operatives to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.  We know the Russians were behind the hacking of DNC emails and that they did so to try and give Trump an advantage in the election.  Furthermore, there is troubling evidence of connections between a number of Trump campaign operatives and the Russians, connections that on more than one occasion those Trump campaign officials were caught lying about.  FBI Director Comey was in charge of what was the one clearly independent investigation of this unprecedented interference in our elections by a foreign power.  Did Trump fire Comey to stop this investigation?  There is no way to prove that, but it is a very troubling coincidence.  Coupled with President Trump's refusal to turn over his tax returns and continuing denial of what the Russians clearly did in the election, there is every reason to believe our president is acting to stop any legitimate investigation into those Russian actions.  We are a nation of laws, not individuals.  By firing Director Comey President Trump has shown he does not understand this basic, governing, Constitutional principle of our nation.  We must continue to push for a special prosecutor to get to the bottom of what happened in the 2016 election and not let this President sweep it under the rug. #ProtectOurDemocracy   https://adamsmith.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/smith-statement-on-firing-of-federal-bureau-of-investigation-director","link","https://adamsmith.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/smith-statement-on-firing-of-federal-bureau-of-investigation-director","adamsmith.house.gov",322,52,40,11,2,6,4,29

While the complete collapse of the tunnel was averted, I remain concerned. The Department of Energy (DOE) is relying more on luck than on certainty that all measures have been taken to avoid a potential incident that could release radiation and contamination. Such an incident would cause unacceptable harm, endanger lives and require long-term evacuations of the area and huge remediation costs. There have been too many near-misses across the nuclear complex. In addition to this latest incident, there are on-going concerns about noxious fumes at Hanford. Looking beyond Hanford to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico, in 2014, a drum burst because of an inexcusable typo in drum packing guidance which could have killed or sickened workers at the site had the underground area not been evacuated a week prior due to an unrelated incident.

Either the President does not understand or simply does not care about the devastating impact global climate change will bring about.    As the world’s second-largest polluter, emitting fifteen percent of global emissions, but with only about five percent of the world’s population, the United States has a moral obligation to reduce carbon emissions. The Administration’s action also shows a disturbing ignorance of our country’s role as an international leader and a complete disregard for the proven science and consequences of a changing climate.  With sea-levels continuing to rise, global temperatures increasing, and record droughts and fires destroying communities, it is irresponsible to abandon the international community. Across the world, extreme weather events and climate change disproportionately impact people and communities of color and those living in poverty. The United States and the international community have supported advancements in global health, stability, and democracy to combat climate change while making strides in promoting policies focused on expanding environmental justice. I have been heartened to see that combined efforts have created new jobs, increased standards of living, and lifted millions out of poverty. Now is not the time for the United States to turn its back on progress and our international partners.  The fight to prevent a changing climate does not stop today.

This interference should deeply concern all Americans, and the need to take measures to protect our democratic system of government should span the political aisle.  It is beyond disturbing for the President to attempt to stifle the FBI investigation into election meddling from any foreign power.

Their meddling has not been confined simply to our borders –  as they carried out aggressive campaigns to disrupt the elections of our European partners. These actions must stop.  In response, I joined a bipartisan majority of my colleagues today in voting in favor of comprehensive legislation that codifies existing sanctions put in place under the Obama Administration and enacts new sanctions against individuals and entities involved in these activities, and brings renewed pressure to the governments of North Korea and Iran. This package makes clear that cyber-attacks, provocative missile tests, and other destabilizing work by these governments runs contrary to global peace and security. It is incumbent upon our nation to lead the international community in confronting these actions.  Today’s vote is a meaningful step in preventing Vladimir Putin from conducting future influence campaigns around the world and ensuring accountability for the Russian Federation’s destabilizing actions in Ukraine including the attempted annexation of Crimea and fomenting conflict in eastern Ukraine. This bill also holds President Trump accountable in any potential roll-back of existing sanctions. It also holds that North Korea’s continued violations of U.N. resolutions and threats to disrupt the Indo-Asia-Pacific region cannot be allowed to continue. Following the July 4, 2017 North Korean missile test, on top of continued Iranian ballistic missile tests, the United States must make clear that further development of long-range weapons systems that threaten the United States and its allies is unacceptable.  Also included in the bill were critically needed initiatives, such as a pilot program to facilitate the processing of remittances by local credit unions and banks here in the United States to Somalia. The ability of Somali Americans to send money to their loved ones is an issue of life or death for families in Somalia, and we must explore creative solutions that allow for the continued flow of remittances to Somalia. The worsening humanitarian crisis in this fragile country will be made far worse if we do not take action.  In recognition of the important provisions of this legislation, I encourage swift enactment of this package of sanctions for President Trump to sign into law.  https://adamsmith.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/smith-statement-in-support-of-bipartisan-sanctions-legislation","status",NA,NA,147,28,11,11,4,1,0,0

Today, of the families who qualify for housing assistance, only a quarter will get the help that they need. While we must work to reduce our nation’s deficit over the long-term, we should not balance the budget on the backs of our nation’s low income families who are already struggling to make ends meet. We must invest in affordable housing now to invest in our future. #OurHomesOurVoices http://gph.is/2tKQZCO","link","http://gph.is/2tKQZCO","gph.is",33,15,1,1,0,4,2,4

This spending package includes funding for the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Legislative Branch, Department of Energy, the Army Corps of Engineers, agencies of the Department of Interior, and several independent agencies.  I am strongly opposed to this legislation because of the level of defense spending it mandates. We cannot continue to increase defense spending at the expense of critical domestic funding priorities such as transportation infrastructure, protecting the environment, ensuring access to education, and providing affordable health care. Additionally, the minibus would require $1.6 billion in wasteful funding for an unnecessary border wall for which the President promised American taxpayers wouldn’t pay, and eviscerates vital funding for clean energy and advanced energy research. The bill does not reflect the priorities of the American people and fails to acknowledge the finite resources that we have at our disposal.    As Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee, I recently voted in support of the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). I did so because I support the policies contained in the NDAA, but I have and continue to raise serious concerns with the unsustainable budgeting that has become the norm for defense spending. In contrast to the NDAA, which authorizes the critical programs for our men and women in uniform, today’s bill spends an untenable level of funding for the Department of Defense. This legislation would trigger sequestration cuts that would make our budget challenges infinitely more difficult to solve. We need to make hard decisions about our fiscal future and invest in building an economy that works for all Americans.","status",NA,NA,61,16,5,7,0,2,0,0

After attempting to bring the legislation up outside of regular order earlier this week, the House Republican leadership ultimately brought the bill to the House Floor today in a format that still did not allow for any amendments. Limiting the ability of Members to offer constructive changes on such a critical component of our government is a disservice to the democratic process.  Ultimately, I feel it is unacceptable to pass the authorization of our intelligence programs without a robust debate of important national security programs like Section 702 of FISA.  Section 702 is a statue that authorizes the collection and use of electronic communications of non-U.S. persons without requiring a warrant or proving probable cause. I have concerns with how this section is being used.  It is unacceptable to pass a blanket extension of our intelligence programs without incorporating significant reforms to ensure the Fourth Amendment rights of Americans are safeguarded.  We must have a transparent and open debate about how we collect information, from whom we collect it, and how it is shared. Congress has a responsibility to thoroughly review and appropriately restructure Section 702 to ensure that American’s civil liberties are protected.  While the United States should be allowed to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance, we must remain vigilant in our protection of the Constitutional rights of American citizens.  https://adamsmith.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/smith-statement-opposing-intelligence-authorization-act","link","https://adamsmith.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/smith-statement-opposing-intelligence-authorization-act","adamsmith.house.gov",46,8,1,0,0,0,2,0

This detestable proposal would slash our legal immigration program in half and keep families apart through dramatically altering our current family-based immigration system to a so-called merit-based program. The bill would also deny asylum to tens of thousands of refugees fleeing dangerous conditions and persecution. The RAISE Act contradicts American values, places the future of our economy at serious risk, and endangers our national security. President Trump’s support for the RAISE Act is based on a dangerous fear of America’s increasing diversity, and illustrates a clear misunderstanding of America’s heritage.   The incredible diversity and the range of talents that immigrants have brought to the United States defines our country and our history. In the Puget Sound region, in addition to contributing to our community as scientists and innovators, immigrants are the backbone of our thriving service and tourism industries. Washington state is the third largest agricultural exporter in the United States, made possible only by the hard work of immigrants.

Health care must include access to affordable birth control and reproductive services. The Trump Administration’s ideologically-driven decision is a shameful sanctioning of gender discrimination that endangers women’s health.     http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/10/06/555970210/trump-ends-requirement-that-employer-health-plans-pay-for-birth-control","link","http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/10/06/555970210/trump-ends-requirement-that-employer-health-plans-pay-for-birth-control","npr.org",49,46,21,2,0,2,12,78

He should let the facts inform him and bear the burden of making the right decisions to safeguard our country’s interests. Instead, President Trump is abdicating his responsibility and kicking the question to Congress, in what appears to be a cravenly political attempt to have it both ways. That is as juvenile as it is dangerous.  Congress must now act responsibly on this issue. Reneging on our obligations under the JCPOA by snapping back sanctions would seriously harm the national security interest of the United States. It could result in war or a nuclear-armed Iran. It would leave the United States isolated from our allies and partners who continue to support the JCPOA. It would undermine our global diplomatic efforts by sending a signal that the United States does not keep its commitments. And it would further destabilize the Middle East. We cannot afford to trigger any of those outcomes, especially at a time when we are confronting so many other grave national security crises.  As the President’s decision not to decertify based on noncompliance implicitly admits, the Iranian government has not failed to deliver on its obligations under the JCPOA, whose terms are limited to the development of nuclear weapons. We have other methods of countering Iran’s malign activities—such as missile launches and terrorist activity—that fall outside the scope of the agreement. We should apply them vigorously to contain and counter Iranian actions that threaten our national security. But we should not take actions that violate our commitments under the JCPOA when adhering to its terms is the best option available, and when the alternatives would invite disaster.  https://adamsmith.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/smith-statement-on-president-trump-s-decision-to-decertify-the-iran-deal","link","https://adamsmith.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/smith-statement-on-president-trump-s-decision-to-decertify-the-iran-deal","adamsmith.house.gov",55,20,3,1,1,4,3,1

Instead of having an honest discussion about our federal budget, House Republicans are attempting to force a partisan bill that will hurt millions of middle class Americans, only to give tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest among us. This tax plan illustrates how far out of touch the Republicans are with the needs of the American people.   Republican’s overly optimistic claims are deeply disingenuous. Their plan will cost Americans $1.5 trillion, or more, and is only partially paid for by eliminating credits and deductions that working and middle class Americans rely on to make ends meet. The cuts in this bill, and the debt increases that they will exacerbate, will not help families or spur job creation. With federal revenues already significantly reduced by the Bush-era tax cuts, this misguided tax plan will further constrain our ability to grow the economy for everyone. To cut taxes for those that do not need it, following trillions of dollars of tax breaks over the past decade and a half, continues to take us in the wrong direction.  http://bit.ly/2z9usPu","link","http://bit.ly/2z9usPu","bit.ly",89,50,24,0,1,3,13,34

It is both bad economic and fiscal policy to be debating a $1.5 trillion tax bill at a time when we are already $20 trillion in debt and running deficits of nearly $700 billion.  With deficits already projected to rise for the foreseeable future, this bill will have devastating impacts on our national debt and the priorities that the constituents of my district have made clear they support. We need to be able to invest in our education system, repair highways and bridges, support healthy children and families, advance scientific innovations and research, and provide for homeland security and our national defense.     History has shown that cutting taxes does not increase revenues or grow the economy. We raised taxes in the early 1990’s, and the country experienced strong economic growth. In contrast, we slashed taxes in the early 2000’s which led to ten years of sluggish economic progress, a ballooning debt, and diminished investment in the economy.  Drastic cuts like the one we will be voting on in the coming days will cause serious risks to the future health of our economy. http://bit.ly/2mapfE8","link","http://bit.ly/2mapfE8","bit.ly",226,64,32,15,1,0,2,6

I voted against H.Res. 599. I believe the resolution did not go far enough to articulate Saudi Arabia’s role in creating and perpetuating the ongoing humanitarian crisis. Instead, the resolution placed a disproportionate level of blame on Iran. Iran remains a detriment to peace and stability in Yemen, however, Saudi Arabia should also be held accountable for their actions.  It is critical that the United States not choose sides in this war. I fear that our historical relationship with Saudi Arabia has resulted in de facto support for the conflict. Understanding that this resolution was a compromise with Republicans in the House, the lack of any enforceable provision removing U.S. support was reason to vote against it. While I do believe that Saudi Arabia is an important ally in the Middle East, the fact is that the people of Yemen currently face a fractured civil infrastructure that has led to what could be the world’s largest Cholera outbreak in history – on top of blockaded ports that have stymied the flow of humanitarian supplies.  Something must change. I am a cosponsor of H.Con.Res. 81, a War Powers resolution introduced by Representative Ro Khanna that would help stop the United States from endorsing what is a nearly intractable conflict. Congress has a critical role to play, and any American involvement can and must be debated transparently. Ultimately, we must find a way to help bring about a peaceful conclusion to this conflict, and that invests heavily in humanitarian assistance for the Yemeni people – including rebuilding their nation after this debilitating period.  https://adamsmith.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-smith-statement-on-yemen-resolution","link","https://adamsmith.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-smith-statement-on-yemen-resolution","adamsmith.house.gov",33,6,0,0,0,0,0,0

Adam Smith","2017-11-17","2017-11-17 19:15:01","This week, the House of Representatives voted to approve the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act Conference Report. This legislation establishes the policies of the Department of Defense that impact our service members, their families, and our local communities.   During the conference process and debate, in my role as Ranking Member, I made sure that a number of important policy provisions remained in the legislation. In addition to supporting members of our Armed Forces and their families, the bill includes important provisions supporting investments in education, public health, workforce development, and prioritizes environmental cleanup. Additionally, the bill secured $190.9 million in funding for construction projects in Washington State that will help create both civilian and military jobs throughout our region. I fought back against efforts to include discriminatory language and ensured critical funding continues to support life-saving medical research. I will continue to advocate for a comprehensive policy that addresses our national security and economic challenges.     I fought for numerous provisions in the FY18 NDAA Conference Report, such as:    Environment:  • Establishes that it is policy of the United States Congress to acknowledge climate change and the impact it continues to have on our national security. • Authorizes $755.6 million for environmental cleanup of the Hanford Nuclear Site.    Education:  • Provides record funding for Impact Aid schools by increasing funding by $50 million to support military connected school districts, including many in Washington State.     Immigration:  • Directs the Secretary of Defense to ensure legal permanent residents serving in the military are informed of the availability of naturalization through their military service.    Military Health:  • Directs DOD to study safe opioid prescribing practices for those currently serving in the Armed Forces. • Blocked earlier attempts to discriminate against transgender service members that would have limited their ability to receive health care.  • Successfully fought to maintain funding to conduct medical research on diseases that contribute to military readiness, such as breast cancer and traumatic brain injury.     Diversity in the Military:  • Recognizes the important contributions of Historically Black Colleges and Universities by increasing funding by $12 million to help educate and train the next generation of scientists and engineers.    Military Spouses:  • Extends survivor benefits for military widows and widowers by permanently extending the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance.    Nuclear Proliferation:  • Requires a report from the Secretary of Defense on how DOD is responding to and reducing the threat of nuclear proliferation.  • Requires a plan to reduce risk of accidental war and encourages dialogue with Russia, China, and North Korea.    Washington State projects include:  • $44.4 million for construction of a project to ensure the safety, accuracy, and efficient storage of munitions required to support ships homeported in Washington State.  • $19.5 million for a new fire station at the Yakima Training Center to provide fire protection and emergency response for base facilities, fires on the training ranges, and local communities in the region.  • $30.0 million for a new Army Reserve Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord.  • $31.0 million for a new National Guard Readiness Center in Tumwater to replace an outdated facility constructed in 1939 and provide administrative, training, and storage areas for Washington National Guard units.","status",NA,NA,32,7,0,0,0,1,0,1

I support the ME TOO Congress Act to reform the complaint process for victims of sexual harassment on Capitol Hill as well as the CEASE Resolution to comprehensively update the Office of Compliance’s policies. We must make it so that everyone is held responsible for their actions. More broadly, we need to ensure transparency and accountability and promote workplace cultures that will prevent sexual harassment in the workplace.","status",NA,NA,108,34,4,5,0,0,1,1

In a stark departure from current reciprocity standards, this legislation will force states with strict concealed carry laws to recognize the lowest common denominator. As written, this bill would allow citizens from some states to carry firearms nearly unrestricted in any state in the country, while only requiring a driver’s license. With gun violence on the rise in America, the act of Congress injecting more firearms into public spaces, while weakening both state and federal statutes, is irresponsible.  Unfortunately, Republicans have chosen to include language in this bill that makes marginal improvements to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). While changes to NICS reporting standards are needed, these benefits do not outweigh the danger posed by the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. We need to be working together to enact sensible firearm safety reforms, including universal background checks on all purchases as well as bolstering our mental health care across the country. This is a step in the wrong direction.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepAdamSmith/videos/1964892070203961/",NA,164,103,41,10,4,4,3,54

This shift is unacceptable, as hospitals are not equipped to administer and implement best practices on housing programs.

In addition to massively benefiting the wealthy and corporations, as well as reducing revenue by more than a trillion dollars, the tax bill endangers important mandatory spending priorities on which middle class and working Americans rely.                                                  In 2010, to help reign in deficit spending, Congress passed what is known as a PAYGO law, requiring that the legislation enacted during a session of Congress not increase the deficit under threat of automatic cuts. Because of its imbalance, the Republican tax bill risks triggering these automatic and across-the-board PAYGO cuts to critical mandatory spending programs. In a strikingly disingenuous statement, the Senate Majority Leader and Speaker of the House have asserted that the PAYGO cuts to mandatory programs that will be triggered by their tax bill “will not happen” for some unspecified and seemingly miraculous reason. Either Republicans have a way to skirt the law that they haven’t shared, or their tax bill is going to trigger the automatic cuts. Both scenarios are terrible for the middle class.   Empty rhetoric is not enough, and Republicans’ irresponsible disregard for the consequences of their actions is dangerous.
