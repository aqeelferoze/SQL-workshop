As elected officials, we are sent here to make tough choices and to represent the people – not to be obstructionists for the sake of it or because it makes us famous on Cable TV. Or worse yet, because it helps out our re-elections, and being called congressman is more important than actually serving as one.

While we are quick to jump on the President’s mistakes, we should be equally ready to give him credit for making a difficult decision. He didn’t embrace this decision easily, and it wasn’t until he became President that he could fully understand the consequences of a lawless Afghanistan. While all of us wish the longest war in U.S. history was over and the Taliban, ISIS and Al Qaeda were no more, this is simply not the reality. The truth is that those groups hate our country and the ideals that we stand for. They want America and our way of life to fall. The President is keeping his promises to not make arbitrary deadlines or project numbers, while accepting that his most important duty as Commander-in-Chief is to keep us safe. As long as there is a threat in Afghanistan, it is his job to stop it. Last night the President told our men and women in uniform that he was going to do just that. I have the utmost faith that our brave service members will dutifully answer his call.","link","http://www.theledger.com/news/20170821/trump-renews-afghanistan-commitment-but-says-no-blank-check","theledger.com",132,69,13,11,1,1,2,28

I’ve heard from many of you whose power has been out for almost a week now (mine is as well), and the impact it's had on you and your families, which is made a lot worse in the Florida heat. I want to assure you that my staff and I have been in constant contact with Duke Energy and multiple agencies at the federal, state, and local levels to ensure that much-needed supplies make it to your County. Just today, Duke Energy reported that 20,945 customers have had their power restored in Highlands. Though it doesn’t make the situation any better, I think it’s important for folks to understand the extent of the damage that the electrical grid in the area sustained—parts of the grid in Highlands County are essentially being rebuilt from scratch. One issue that companies are facing is a lack of resources due to high demand. Duke alone had 3,000 poles and 1,000 miles of wire go down, which they need to either repair, stand back up or replace. Sometimes even if they have crews in place, they’re still waiting for supplies to arrive. Duke has told us that much-needed resources are headed to Highlands County and that they feel that, even though the grid is badly-damaged in some places, they’ve reached a turning point. Hopefully many more residents in Highlands will begin to see their power restored throughout the next week. I know you are very frustrated, and I am too - but I will keep making sure the needs of Florida's heartland are not forgotten about. As always, should you need any assistance or have any questions, please do not hesitate to call my office at 202-225-5792.","status",NA,NA,151,52,107,7,1,5,2,0

This program is available at no cost to eligible primary homeowners with less than 50 percent structural damage in Charlotte, DeSoto, Glades, Hardee, Highlands, Lee, Polk, and Sarasota counties. Other counties may be added at a later date.  To get assistance, you are required to sign a “Right of Entry” (ROE) form to allow Corps staff and contractors to access your private property and assess roof damage. You must sign up in person once a Blue Roof location has been established in your area. At this time, Operation Blue Roof has set up in the following locations in FL-17, which are open from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.:  -Lee: Lowes Home Improvement Center, 8040 Dani Drive, Fort Myers, FL 33966  -Hardee: Hardee County Library, 315 N. 6th Ave. Wauchula, FL 33873  -Highlands: County Civic Center, 4509 George Blvd. Sebring, FL 33875 (staff will be at the east end of the parking lot)   -Polk: Near Airport, 5253 Airport Blvd. Bartow, FL  -Sarasota: Bee Ridge Park, 4430 South Lockwood Ridge Rd. Sarasota, FL  Before you go, determine if you qualify for the program:   1.  The home must be the primary residence* of the person or household requesting the emergency roof covering; AND  2. The residence has more than 50 percent of the roof framing undamaged. The framing must support the plastic sheeting as a temporary repair, and be able to provide safe shelter once contractors install the tarp; AND  3. The resident certifies that he or she is the owner of the residence requested to be covered OR is a renter that has obtained legal permission to continue occupying the residence until more permanent repairs are made; AND  4. The resident certifies that they will shelter in the residence that they have requested to be covered; AND  5. The roof must be standard roof shingles, or a similar material that will allow contractors to nail the tarp in place. Contractors will consider repairs to metal roofs and mobile homes on a case-by-case basis and will install the cover if possible.  Contractors cannot cover roofs made of materials such as slate, asbestos or clay tile, or other material which would be exceptionally difficult to repair, or would likely be damaged during tarp installation.","status",NA,NA,36,11,57,0,0,0,0,0
