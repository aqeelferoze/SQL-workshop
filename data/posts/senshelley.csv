Throughout this debate, I have said that I will only support a bill that provides access to affordable health care coverage for West Virginians, including those on Medicaid and those struggling with drug addiction. In West Virginia, Obamacare has led to skyrocketing premiums, co-pays, and deductibles for families and small businesses. Patients have fewer choices in doctors and hospitals as networks shrink and plans become more restrictive.  I have consistently looked for opportunities to improve this broken law, including co-sponsoring the Patient Freedom Act of 2017 earlier this year. I continue to believe we must repair what can be fixed, scrap what is not working, and create a better health care reality for West Virginians. At the same time, West Virginia has the largest Medicaid population in the country. I recognize that many West Virginians rely on health coverage and access to substance abuse treatment because of my state‚Äôs decision to expand coverage through Medicaid. I have studied the draft legislation and CBO analysis to understand its impact on West Virginians. As drafted, this bill will not ensure access to affordable health care in West Virginia, does not do enough to combat the opioid epidemic that is devastating my state, cuts traditional Medicaid too deeply, and harms rural health care providers.

This was a significant step, but it has become clear that more can be done to prevent addiction and opioid abuse among out veterans served by community care providers. Today, I introduced another bill, the Andrew White Veterans Community Care Opioid Safety Act, which I named in memory of West Virginia veteran Andrew White. This legislation will help ensure the health and well-being of all veterans seeking care‚Äîveterans like Andrew who tragically lost his life after being overprescribed. I‚Äôm proud to honor Andrew‚Äôs memory with this bill and to continue such an important effort with Senator Tammy Baldwin.","status",NA,NA,15,20,3,0,0,0,0,3
