Davis on President Trump’s executive order on the travel rights of individuals from certain Muslim-majority countries.  I am outraged, and I condemn in the strongest terms, the executive order issued by President Trump  aimed at the world’s most vulnerable people: refugees and asylum seekers who are fleeing the most horrific wartime conditions.  The order has also swept up individuals who have previously been carefully vetted by our national security system including students and faculty, green card holders, tech workers, dual nationals and others.  This is an action aimed at excluding individuals based on religion and country of origin and does nothing to enhance our security.  On the contrary, it will fan the flames of religious bigotry and extremism.  The actions taken by Customs and Border Protection to detain, exclude and, in some cases, return individuals to immediate danger are in violation of U.S. and international law and I am doing, and will continue to do, all in my power to have the order rescinded and those who have been harmed offered protection.  As is now clear from news reports, the order was drafted without appropriate input from relevant agencies including the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice.  The language of the executive order is vague and imprecise and the Trump administration now appears to be attempting to redefine the meaning of the order resulting in still more confusion.  As Judge Ann Donnelly, who issued an emergency stay in response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU stated, “I think the government hasn’t had a full chance to think about this.” The language of the order suggests that the order may be broadened in coming days beyond the seven countries of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and that the number of individuals potentially affected could increase significantly.  Trump’s order has been met by mass protests across the country.  Protesters have emphasized that the order is not only illegal but stands in contradiction to our nation’s values and precepts.  We are a nation of immigrants, a nation built by immigrants, a nation drawing its character and strength from our diversity.  I am proud to live among, and represent, a people who stand up for our values and I stand with and applaud those who have peacefully, but emphatically, joined together to resist this order as an attack on our democracy.","status",NA,NA,114,36,11,12,0,0,0,0

Davis","2017-02-15","2017-02-15 16:35:59","Today, Chairman Smith and I (Ranking Member) held a hearing on the “Geography of Poverty""  in the Human Resources Subcommittee Committee of the House Ways and Means Commitee.  We know poverty is a serious problem in rural, urban, and suburban communities.  No matter where you live, a good job is the most efficient way out of poverty.  To get and keep good jobs, many workers need better opportunities to upgrade their skills and basic supports, like child care and health care.  In 2015, 43 million Americans, including 14.5 million children, lived in poverty.  We have made significant progress to reduce poverty since the Great Recession – the poverty rate declined significantly last year for almost all demographic groups.  However, income is still lower, and poverty higher, than it was in 2007, before the recession.  Despite declines between 2014 and 2015, poverty rates are much higher for African-Americans (24%) and Latinos (21%).  Poverty rates are also much higher for non-citizens (including both documented and undocumented immigrants) – 21% in 2015.  There is considerable regional variation, but nationally, rural areas have both lower median income and also lower poverty (less dramatic income inequality).  Thirteen percent of rural Americans are below the federal poverty line, as compared to 16 percent of urban Americans. However, both poverty and unemployment are higher in counties that the Census Bureau classifies as “completely rural” than those considered “mostly rural.”   Poverty rates for people of color are similar whether individuals live in rural or urban areas, but poverty rates for white Americans are higher in rural areas than in urban areas.   There is also some geographic variation - • Poverty rates are significantly higher in urban areas than in rural areas in the Northeast and Midwest. • There is a much smaller difference in the West. • There is only a slight difference between urban and rural poverty rates in the South (where overall poverty rates are much higher).  In part because of the foreclosure crisis, suburbs have seen the fastest poverty growth in recent years, and where the largest numbers of poor Americans live.  The Brookings Institute estimates that about 16.4 million Americans in poverty live in the suburbs, as compared to 13.4 million in big cities and 7.3 million in rural areas (number does not add up to 43 million because many people live in areas that don’t fit neatly into those three categories).  Between 2000 and 2012, the number of suburban poor living in neighborhoods with concentrated poverty grew by 139%, and almost half of high-poverty census tracts are in the suburbs.  We will be looking ways to move Americans out of poverty via Federal programs at our disposal.  Today we have testimony from:  William Leavy, Executive Director, Greater West Town Project (Chicago).  Mr. Leavy will talk about urban poverty, and how GWTP works to improve economic opportunities and reduce poverty for hard-to-employ people from poor Chicago neighborhoods.  Elizabeth Kneebone, Fellow, Metropolitan Policy Program, Brookings Institution.   Dr. Kneebone is the co-author of Confronting Suburban Poverty in America, which details the rapid growth of poverty in the suburbs, and has advocated an evidence-based policy approach.    Mark Partridge, Professor, Swank Chair in Rural-Urban Policy, Ohio State University.  Dr. Partridge is a specialist in regional science whose recent work has focused on income inequality and how economic shocks affect local communities. He also may talk about his recent research about urban and rural  economic interdependence.  Tammy Slater, CEO, Goodwill Industries of Greater Nebraska.  Ms. Slater will talk about rural poverty in central and western Nebraska and the donor-funded services Goodwill provides, including job training, paid work, behavioral health and disability services, and housing assistance.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanDKDavis/photos/a.305491412795734.86537.280757931935749/1479706772040853/?type=3",NA,14,8,7,0,0,0,0,0

Davis","2017-02-28","2017-02-28 17:56:52","My Statement this morning before the Commerce, Justice, State and Related Agencies testimony in support of Second Chance Funding.  ""Good Morning.  Chairman Culbertson and Ranking Member Serrano, I am here today to advocate for a critical program that is reconnecting families and stabilizing communities; The Second Chance Act.  The Second Chance Act, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support and was signed into law in April 2008, authorized $165 million for programs that has improved coordination of reentry services and policies at the state and local levels.   The SCA includes a program for Adult and Juvenile Offender State and Local Reentry Demonstration Projects, which improve coordination of reentry initiatives and implement evidence-based practices.  In addition, the SCA also authorizes a program for Mentoring Grants to Nonprofit organizations, which provide mentoring and other transitional services to adult and juvenile offenders reentering the community.   At the end of 2014, federal, state, and local correctional facilities held more than 2.2 million people. This amounted to at least one in every 200 residents.  Unfortunately, most individuals face numerous challenges when returning to the community from prison and research indicates that over half return to prison within three years of their release.  At least 95 percent of people incarcerated in state prisons will be released back to their communities at some point.  Research suggests that, without support, more than two-thirds will be rearrested within three years of their release, and half will be re-incarcerated.  However, when individuals returning from prison are able to access the services they need to rebuild their lives, the families and communities they return to are stronger and safer.  There have been more than 700 grants awarded in 49 states, allowing reentry programs to expand.  Second Chance grantees have served more than 137,000 participants since 2009, with 83 percent of all adults served receiving mental health and/or substance use treatment services and referrals.  Also, 60 percent of all adult participants have received cognitive-based services.  Major Second Chance Act grant programs—including those awarded to community-based organizations—are prioritizing the use of grant dollars for independent program evaluations.  State and local governments and nonprofit organizations around the country have been eagerly launching innovative reentry programs, and families and communities are desperate to access the services the Second Chance Act provides.  Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, I am hopeful for full funding of the Second Chance Act and I look forward to working with you on this request.  I also would like to submit to the record further information on the success of the SCA.  Thank you.""","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanDKDavis/photos/a.305491412795734.86537.280757931935749/1493048870706643/?type=3",NA,17,12,6,9,0,0,0,0
