Despite brutal defenses they scaled those bluffs and secured a beachhead on the continent in the name of freedom and liberty. Today we honor the 73rd anniversary of D-Day, the beginning of the “Great Crusade,” which led to the Allied liberation of Western Europe from Nazi Germany. The courageous sacrifices of those troops lasted long past D-Day with 11 more months of hard-fought battles ending in Berlin and victory.
