Most immigrants do not enter the United States with a goal to do harm, but to escape the conditions they faced where they are from. They know that living in the United States will present numerous new opportunities for them. We, as Americans, know that our country is great, so we must handle all things according to our standards, and banning these people in need of a fresh start from our country is not up to them….

Over the past decade, we have seen tragic attacks take place in a Charleston church, an Orlando nightclub, downtown Dallas, an office park in San Bernardino, and on a college campus in Ohio.  Law enforcement and first responders are on the front lines of preparing for and responding to these kinds of attacks.  It is critical that they have the training and exercises to do their jobs effectively.  The most effective planning and exercises, however, must include non-law enforcement partners who would be involved in the response.   My amendment ensures that a variety of partners--from mass gathering venue operators to educational institutions to places of worship--are included in exercises that inform response plans and the training funded under the grant program authorized by H.R. 2188.

The last minute changes to the bill do not change that fact.  At least 24 million Americans, and perhaps many more, will still lose health coverage as a result of Trumpcare. People with pre-existing conditions will lose their guaranteed access to equal treatment. Costs for American families will still skyrocket, and at the same time coverage will get worse.  New Jerseyans aged 50 to 64 will be charged up to five times more in premiums than what others pay, as part of the bills ‘age tax.’ With its cuts to Medicaid, the bill also targets special education services, putting at risk families in New Jersey, which has one of the highest rates of autism in the country.  Republicans rushed this vote through the House without a CBO score to hide the extent of damage Trumpcare will cause to the American people and the nation’s health care system. They are so desperate for a ‘win’ that they only care about the bill passing the House, not the harm it will do or even if it’s dead on arrival in the Senate.  Republicans are treating health care as if it’s a game. The American people will hold them accountable.","status",NA,NA,44,14,16,1,0,0,3,11

The Trump-Ryan-McConnell tax plan is a tax increase for nearly two million lower- and middle-income people in New Jersey. By eliminating the federal deduction for state and local taxes, the plan will take money out of people’s pockets and out of New Jersey to fund tax cuts for the one percent. That’s just not going to work.  If you pay state and local taxes on your hard-earned money, the federal government should respect that. After all, state and local taxes pay for our roads, our schools, our police, and all the essential services we rely on each day.

This morning, I joined Members of #Congress on the Capitol steps to demand that Republicans join #Democrats to establish a Select Committee on Gun Violence Prevention that will study gun violence in the United States and make recommendations that put people first.

Firearms kill people by the dozens in one mass shooting after another. Firearms kill and injure people on the streets every day. And firearms are the most lethal method of suicide.

The Select Committee on Gun Violence will address all these issues and make recommendations that help save lives.   —with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Grace F.

The American people want sensible tax reform that builds infrastructure, helps out those in need, empowers young people to get an education, protects the middle class, and stops tilting the board in favor of billionaires.  The GOP tax scam will harm real people. We cannot forget that. Earlier this week, students from the Cristo Rey Newark High School came to the Capitol to tell me about how the GOP tax bill will hurt their educational prospects. The young people I met with are from financially struggling families. They worked hard and got accepted into an innovative school. To gain professional skills, the students take part in corporate work-study programs. Their earnings go toward their college preparatory education. That model works. Last year, 100 percent of Cristo Rey Newark’s students were accepted into four-year colleges.   But under the GOP tax scam, these bright young people from financially disadvantaged families will have to pay taxes on their work-study earnings – taxes they cannot afford.   That is wrong!  I will continue to stand against the GOP tax scam and stand for programs that benefit America’s children.","video","https://www.facebook.com/DonaldPayneJr/videos/1457295664378507/",NA,24,1,2,2,0,0,0,0

In my hometown of Newark, New Jersey, new HIV cases have been rising among young people under the age of twenty-five. Experts link the rise in new HIV-AIDS cases among young people in Newark to the opioid crisis. A similar pattern is playing out across the country: areas affected by the opioid crisis and intravenous drug use are disproportionately vulnerable to new HIV infections.   There has been a lot of discussion lately about the opioid crisis, but most of the talk focuses on rural America. We cannot lose sight of the fact that the opioid crisis is inseparable from other social issues — including health care access, mental health treatment, public health, poverty, and joblessness.  Congress can help end the opioid crisis and the HIV-AIDS crisis here in the United States. To do that, we must increase funding for health care access, mental health treatment, anti-poverty programs, disease control, education, and access to HIV PrEP medication, which greatly reduces a person’s chances of getting HIV.","video","https://www.facebook.com/DonaldPayneJr/videos/1471633319611408/",NA,17,3,6,2,0,0,1,0

This morning’s attack occurred at the country’s largest bus terminal, which carries nearly a quarter of a million commuters into and out of New York City each day – many of them New Jerseyans who I represent.   Attacks like this morning’s Port Authority Bus Terminal explosion are meant to weaken the bonds that hold the American people together.

My heart goes out to the parents and families of the children and adults who died that day.  My triplets were barely teenagers at the time. And I was stricken with the same fear parents everywhere feel when confronted with the reality that we cannot always protect our children. The same fear of senseless gun violence plays out daily in communities throughout the United States. Every day in this country, forty-six children are shot. Every day in this country, seven children die from gun violence. Those statistics do not occur in any other high-income country on this planet.  As parents, we may not be able to protect our children from the world, but those of us who are both parents and Members of the United States Congress have the power to make the world safer for all children.   We in the Democratic Party have repeatedly introduced reasonable measures to protect the American people from gun violence.   We have proposed bills that would stop the online sale of bulk ammunition.   We have proposed programs to buy back some of the guns that are most often used in crimes.   We have proposed banning assault weapons.   We have tried standing up. We have tried speaking out. We have tried sitting in for sensible gun safety laws.   But each time we take action, the NRA and its allies in Congress shut us down.   So, here we are — five years after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, still waiting for the nation's leaders to lead.   Here we are, crying out to prevent the deaths of the seven children who will die by gunshot before the day is over.
