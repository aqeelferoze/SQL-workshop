The Veteran Identification Card will serve as proof of service in the Armed Forces and can be used to obtain discounts on goods and services offered to Veterans. Application must be submitted via VETS.gov. As part of the application process, Veterans will be asked to upload photo identification such as a Driver’s License or Passport. All honorably discharged Veterans of every era will be able to get a free photo identification card from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VIC does not qualify Veterans for additional benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and does not serve as proof for any benefits to which you may be entitled. Also, the VIC will not grant access to military post or installations. Questions about Veteran Identification Card (VIC) can be directed to VETS.gov, Help Desk 1-855-574-7286, TTY: 1-800-877-8339.   In addition, Veterans can also apply for enrollment for the Veteran Health Identification Cards (VHIC) by visiting www.va.gov/healthbenefits/enroll, calling 1-877-222-VETS (8387) on Monday – Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET., or by visiting a local VA medical facility. The VHIC is for identification and check-in at VA appointments and will be issued only to Veterans who are enrolled in the VA health care system. It cannot be used as a credit card or an insurance card, and it does not authorize or pay for care at non-VA facilities. Once enrollment is verified, Veterans may have their picture taken at local VA medical center, so that a VHIC can be mailed to them. Veterans will have to upload a copy of their driver’s license or passport, as well as a photo, in order to obtain this card.","link","http://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/enroll","va.gov",63,14,92,2,0,0,0,0

At over $20.5 trillion, the current federal debt is simply unsustainable. The proposed tax bill provides tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy on the backs of our children, grandchildren, and the middle class. It explodes the national debt and puts budgetary pressure on key programs, including Social Security and Medicare. As an institution, we are at a moment of truth. It is past time to put our political differences aside, and to finally find common ground to address the national debt and get our fiscal house in order.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/sanfordbishop/photos/a.414537466606.190137.366739521606/10154899506076607/?type=3",NA,104,78,21,1,2,0,4,16

However, it needs to be fair, balanced, and fiscally responsible both in the short and the long term. The benefits must be shared among Georgians of all income levels rather than just concentrated at the top. The tax legislation approved by the U.S. House of Representatives today fails this test.  As an institution, we in Congress are at a moment of truth. The time is now to put our political differences aside, and to find common ground on a rational tax package that is fiscally responsible, grows the economy, creates jobs, and improves the lives of all Americans.","link","https://bishop.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-bishop-statement-in-opposition-to-misguided-tax-bill","bishop.house.gov",201,172,32,36,5,0,1,38
