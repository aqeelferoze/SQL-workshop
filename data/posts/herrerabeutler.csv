But we can do better than the current House replacement plan, and I cannot support it in its current form.  While I appreciate this week's effort by Speaker Ryan and his leadership team to better protect older Americans from health care cost increases, the difficulties this bill would create for millions of children were left unaddressed.  I’m disappointed that it appears my amendment to strengthen the Medicaid safety net for the kids who depend on it for their health care will not be considered.  Protecting vulnerable children is a core purpose of the Medicaid program and when the program fails to do so, it fails entirely.   I will not vote to let those kids fall through the cracks.  Southwest Washington residents also deserve a greater commitment to lowering health costs so that out-of-pocket expenses, premiums and taxes are taking up less of their monthly paychecks.  Congress should more purposefully move ahead with free market reforms that increase competition between insurance providers and drive down premiums and deductibles.  Obamacare also levied numerous taxes on hardworking Americans, and in our effort to pull back this harmful law we should more quickly repeal them.  In the final analysis, this bill falls short.  We can't give up on replacing Obamacare with a solution that provides affordable, high-quality health care to all Americans.

We’ve learned some of the facts, and they aren’t good: It takes on average 134 days – that’s over four months – for the Veterans Health Administration to hire a healthcare provider. And 8% of the providers who made it through the credentialing phase – which means they’ve been in the VA hiring process on average 74 days – do not end up being hired by the VHA because they receive another job opportunity during this lengthy hiring process. Then, the VHA is forced to start the hiring process all over again – at the expense of agency funding and the loss of good providers.  Veterans are the ones who ultimately feel the adverse effects of the delays when they have to wait extended periods of time to receive medical attention due to the lack of providers. This is a critical issue, and I’ll stay dogged in my efforts to better understand and help tackle these problems.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/herrerabeutler/photos/a.185529758145674.40382.177551525610164/1593591017339534/?type=3",NA,42,24,6,4,0,1,0,3

I think of the firefighters on 9/11 who rushed into the smoke, flames, and debris – danger in its purest form – to save lives. We should do everything we can to mitigate the adverse health risks for our country’s firefighter heroes, which is why I am proud to have cosponsored the Firefighter Cancer Registry Act of 2017, which passed the House today. This bill requires the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention to develop and maintain a registry to collect data regarding the incidence of cancer in firefighters. This registry will allow researchers to have a greater understanding of the impacts smoke inhalation and other occupational hazards have on a firefighter’s health, and lead to better treatment options.","status",NA,NA,43,14,1,2,0,1,0,0
