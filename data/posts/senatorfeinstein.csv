However, his record and ties to major fossil fuel polluters demonstrate extreme hostility toward that view. Throughout his career in Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt sued the EPA numerous times over its right to enforce regulations of carbon emissions, fought to block federal air and water regulation and challenged the science behind many of the agency’s decisions.

Simply put, it would devastate California and leave millions without health insurance.   The plan would cut financial help for low- and middle-income families and replace it with tax credits too small to help those who need it most and tax breaks for insurance company CEOs.  The plan would end Medi-Cal as we know it, the state’s Medicaid program that covers 13.5 million Californians. The federal government currently covers a fixed portion of the cost of health care services for Medi-Cal beneficiaries. Under the Republican plan, the federal government would place a strict limit on the amount it pays for each Medi-Cal beneficiary. The state would be on the hook for the rest of the cost, which would overwhelm the state’s budget.   Continuing the years-long attack on Planned Parenthood, the plan would defund this critical health care provider. Women in California who go to Planned Parenthood for basic preventive care, including annual check-ups, would be forced to go elsewhere or do without care. It’s the height of hypocrisy for Republicans to espouse the importance of patient choice and then move to deny 776,000 patients in California the ability to see their doctor.  Republicans should be working to improve the Affordable Care Act rather than putting forward a half-baked plan that would leave Californians worse off.","status",NA,NA,876,331,424,9,4,16,205,691

All women face unique challenges, but we also share the same goals—equality and fairness. We’ve made great strides in our mission, but there are a few areas in which we must continue to focus our effort.  Reproductive Rights   We’ve seen gains over the past few generations in large part due to expanded reproductive rights. We must protect that. I remember what it was like before Roe v. Wade. We simply can’t return to those times. We must protect our rights so women can control their own bodies.  Equal Pay  Women in America STILL get just 80 cents for every dollar paid to men. That means, women who perform the same job as men, with the same level education, still suffer from a wage gap. I’m proud that California has enacted the strongest equal-pay law in the country. Congress must follow, so those standards are followed nationwide.  Paid Leave  The United States is the ONLY developed country that doesn’t guarantee paid time off to care for a new baby or sick family member. That’s why it has become increasingly difficult for women to meet the demands of family and work. California’s paid leave program, in place for nearly 15 years, has been a tremendous success. It’s time to create a federal paid-leave program so ALL families can access those types of benefits.  Health Care  Before the Affordable Care Act, only 12 percent of individual  health plans covered maternity care. A big reason we must preserve the ACA. 776,000 women in California get preventative care at Planned Parenthood. They’ll lose that under the new Republican plan.  Women do so much for families, their communities and the economy. International Women’s Day is a chance to honor that.   My message for the day: Wear your red with pride!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorFeinstein/photos/a.337435776279600.76865.334887279867783/1337899032899931/?type=3",NA,894,164,87,126,2,6,2,2

She has said that the poorest Americans need to have ‘skin in the game’ and pay more for their health care—a popular policy among Republicans. I can assure her that the poorest people in our society already have ‘skin in the game.’  Verma also made deeply troubling statements in her confirmation hearings, stating that she thought insurance companies should not be required to cover maternity care.

The situation in the West Bank is grave. There are nearly 400,000 settlers on 129 official settlements directly supported by the Israeli government.

I’ll never forget the images of row after row of dead men, women and children wrapped in body bags and shrouds, awaiting burial.  That 2013 attack spurred an international effort to rid Syria of its chemical weapons, and by 2016 the United Nations had destroyed 1,200 tons of chemical agents. But unfortunately that didn’t end the use of chemical weapons in Syria.  Rather than using nerve agents, Assad loaded barrels with chlorine and dropped them from helicopters on towns that rejected his authoritarian rule. Backed by Russia and Iran, Assad’s butchery continued, and today nearly 500,000 civilians have died in this civil war.  This week, Assad again used chemical nerve agents to kill his own people. The United States and the international community cannot continue to countenance a leader who has now killed 1,500 of his own people with chemical weapons that the rest of the world has agreed never to use.  Last night’s cruise missile strikes against the Syrian airfield that launched the chemical weapons attack was a limited but necessary response to those heinous acts, and I hope the intended message was received. The United States cannot continue to stand by and watch Assad commit these atrocities.  President Assad is not the only leader at fault. Russia has made this problem worse by shielding Assad from international intervention, allowing him to ignore the 2013 UN order to destroy all chemical weapons and reconstitute his chemical weapons program.

I’ve long called for an end to the EB-5 program. It says that visas—and eventual U.S. citizenship—are for sale, a terrible message for the 4.4 million people waiting in line for visas—some for as long as 23 years.   EB-5 is also rife with fraud and abuse. In addition to numerous cases of securities fraud, the program is frequently exploited by real estate developers to finance projects in the wealthiest parts of this country. This is a far cry from the program’s original intent to spur economic development in depressed communities. There isn’t a better example of how the program has been distorted than the Kushner Company’s marketing campaign in China.   Given that President Trump and Jared Kushner refuse to divest from their vast financial holdings, the only way to eliminate this conflict is for Congress to allow the program to expire in September.

Importantly, 400,000 people who are insured, but may be struggling to pay their premiums will also gain access to tax-credit subsidies.   Older Americans between ages 50-64 would see the greatest benefit because they pay up to three times more for insurance. It’s estimated that 96 percent of the newly insured would be in this age group.   Expanding eligibility for tax-credit subsidies would partially pay for itself.

Nothing in Nielsen’s record or testimony indicates that the department under her leadership would treat a family like this one differently.","status",NA,NA,1857,1025,211,41,41,30,297,305

That is why President Trump’s decision today to unilaterally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel without any progress toward peace is a major setback to a two-state solution. His announcement rejects decades of bipartisan policy and undermines our standing with the Palestinians and our partners in the region.   In 1995 we passed a bill to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and move the U.S. embassy in the context of the Oslo peace process. Today, there are no direct negotiations, and by taking this action there’s a real potential to further inflame the Middle East. I urge all sides to exercise restraint at this difficult time.","status",NA,NA,1182,1039,227,20,55,35,295,403

They advanced the NRA’s top priority in the wake of two of the deadliest shootings in U.S. history—before they’ve taken even a single step to prevent gun violence. It’s truly beyond the pale.   This concealed carry bill would effectively allow states with the weakest gun laws, like Arizona, to supersede states with the strongest gun laws, including California. In our state, concealed carry is allowed only by permit of law enforcement—and that’s the way it should be.   California has tight restrictions on concealed carry. Under this bill, someone who can carry a concealed weapon in Arizona without a permit would be able do the same in California, even though California has strict permit requirements for concealed carry. Republicans are all for state’s rights unless a state wants to protect its citizens from gun violence.    California law enforcement is uniformly opposed to this bill, which would put officers at greater risk and make it harder to keep our communities safe. We will do all we can to ensure this bill doesn’t see the light of day in the Senate.","status",NA,NA,1193,1655,552,114,133,69,270,1768

I’ll never forget the pit in my stomach when I heard the news.    I keep a copy of the New York Daily News cover with photos of the children and the words ‘Shame on Us’ in my office as a constant reminder of why we continue to fight for commonsense laws to prevent gun violence.    Five years later Congress has done nothing—nothing—to protect our communities.   I renew my call for Republicans to support our bill to ban bump-fire stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns. I’ve reached out to 17 Republican senators. They all agree in theory that civilians shouldn’t have bump-stocks, but won’t sign on. Today, of all days, is a day for every Republican senator to consider supporting our bill.   Banning bump stocks is just one of the many steps we should take. We also need to improve the background check system, ensure all sales are subject to background checks and ban military-style assault weapons. We honor the memory of those 20 children by taking action, not with our words.","status",NA,NA,1771,942,428,71,13,13,1482,366

Just days before a potential government shutdown, Republicans have rushed through a tax cut bill written in secret that adds more than $1 trillion to the deficit in order to give the top 1 percent a big tax cut. That’s unconscionable.   Republicans will now turn around and claim we don’t have enough money for domestic programs like Medicare and Social Security. The middle class can’t afford to lose these vital programs.  Even more appalling, Republicans made the huge tax cut for corporations permanent while the few savings given to the middle class disappear over time. Talk about misplaced priorities.  Californians will be hit especially hard by the cap on the state and local tax deduction, making it more difficult for communities to pay for services that our families rely on.  It’s no wonder a bill that primarily benefits the wealthy is so unpopular with the American people. They understand this isn’t middle-class tax reform, it’s a middle-class tax hike.","status",NA,NA,1775,2373,1132,40,258,62,811,3473

I’ve been a vocal supporter of young people protected by DACA since President Obama created the program in 2012. I’ve been an advocate for CHIP, which insures millions of children, for two decades. I’m not new to these issues, and my positions haven’t changed.   It’s absolutely unconscionable that Republicans are leaving these items out of their bill to fund the government. Given the lack of any realistic plan to pass the Dream Act and long-term CHIP funding, it’s my intention to vote against the continuing resolution.  Around one-third of all young people protected by DACA live in California. I’ve talked with them, I’ve met with them, I understand their plight and it breaks my heart. In California, 200,000 DACA youth are living in fear. The government knows where they live, where they study and where they work, and unless Congress acts, they know the government can show up at any moment and deport them.   To allow these young people to suffer is tragic.   These young people came here through no choice of their own. Most know no other country than the United States. The country overwhelmingly believes they shouldn’t be deported. And yet all we get from Donald Trump and congressional Republicans is lip-service.   I call on President Trump, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan to do their job, include the Dream Act in this bill, include long-term funding for CHIP in this bill, include funding to stabilize the Affordable Care Act so millions don’t lose health care.   Republicans so far this year have put on a terrific display in how not to run a government. Please do your job, the country demands it.","status",NA,NA,2427,1274,291,236,83,24,205,192
