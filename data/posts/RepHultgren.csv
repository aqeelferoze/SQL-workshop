I do not believe in simply repealing the ACA and walking away. If repeal is to happen, I will work with my colleagues to replace the law gradually over time with a system that offers Americans more and better choices for health insurance. Any replacement of the law must improve plan choice, provider choice and affordability for people in the 14th District, or I won’t support it.  Health insurance coverage should be accessible and affordable for all Americans, but Obamacare has delivered on none of these promises. The ACA has created a marketplace with more expensive and fewer insurance options, and fewer doctor and hospital networks for everyone.  Statewide, Illinois residents have had to pay some of the highest premium increases and have faced some of the fewest plan, doctor and hospital options in the country. I have heard countless stories from my constituents who have lost insurance plans, been shut out of doctor networks they rely on for care and faced an effective pay cut with new high-deductible plans. Many in Illinois cannot go to their nearest hospital for care.  I supported this measure because I believe we need to do better by people in Illinois and the 14th District.

Given the nature of the threats we face in the 21st century, I believe it is prudent to once again review and strengthen our visa screening processes to ensure those we let into our country have American interests at heart. I believe we can and must continue to strive for that balance of compassion and security.  I have consistently fought for strengthening our security policies. I believe that the vetting within the refugee program is already extensive and thorough—it is currently the most difficult and lengthy process to get into the United States, typically taking 18 months or more for a vulnerable family to survive while they wait approval to enter our country. I expect the rigor of the vetting process to be confirmed during the 120-day review of our current visa policies regarding refugees. I also urge recommendations that will increase collaboration and the sharing of information between our international partners, federal law enforcement agencies and local communities.  Unfortunately, the President's executive order is overly broad and its interpretation has been inconsistent and confused. This has led to unintended consequences, like the barring of legal permanent residents and the rejection of Syrian Christians at the airport, a religious minority that was supposed to be protected by the executive order.  Keeping America First means keeping our principles first—both compassion and security. To remain the world's shining city on a hill and beacon of hope to many, we should have our arms open to those who are fleeing oppression and seeking safety, not turning them away at the door.","status",NA,NA,201,182,38,20,0,3,1,22

Our seniors deserve respectful and dignified living situations.  Concerns mentioned that I am committed to addressing:  -Accountability: What does Illinois do with the federal money it receives? How and when can providers like Heritage Woods expect to receive their funds from the state?  -Delays: Applications sent to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are to be approved within 45 days. Yet often this stretches out months. Payments to doctors are way behind as well. We can't have patients left in a state of limbo before getting the care they need.

There’s been much discussion and confusion about S.J.Res. 34 which passed the House this week and reverses a recent Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulation on internet privacy.  When this regulation was promulgated the FCC claimed that the rules would provide broadband customers meaningful choice, greater transparency and strong security protections for their personal information collected by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). ISPs only include a designated number of providers. As these ISPs do not have unique or complete access to consumers’ online activity, the FCC rules arbitrarily treat ISPs differently from the rest of the internet. The most popular search engines like Google and Microsoft’s Bing, as well as third-party companies, were carved out, creating a false sense of privacy that simply doesn’t exist. This left a vast majority of consumer information unprotected and does a great disservice to consumers. That’s why I supported reversing this rule.  I believe the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which has been focused on protecting consumers since the 1970s, should maintain its jurisdiction over this area. In a bid to expand its own power, the FCC stripped the FTC of its jurisdictional authority and reclassified ISPs as common carriers. The FCC’s power grab created a dual-track system in which the FCC applies its own set of rules for ISPs while the FTC monitors the rest of the internet ecosystem. The FTC has been the “cop on the beat” for decades and the FCC’s decision abandoned a bipartisan privacy protection system to advance its own political clout.  Contrary to some reports, personal health and financial information are already protected under existing regulatory regimes created by the Gramm Leach Biley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The FCC’s rule did nothing to expand these protections. Reversing the rule did nothing to diminish them.  Reversing the FCC’s overreaching regulation puts all segments of the internet on equal footing and moves consumer privacy protection back to the FTC where it is best housed. American consumers will be once again provided with a consistent set of privacy rules.","status",NA,NA,47,181,31,0,4,1,8,95

I have had great concerns about the American Health Care Act, and expressed those to Speaker Ryan and House leadership. But doing nothing isn't an option, which I why I supported this amended bill as an important next step in the longer process of broader health reform that will benefit Illinois.  The Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) downward spiral is accelerating. This year, three of the seven counties in the 14th Congressional District are left with only one insurance carrier on the ACA exchange, and there are communities in my district that saw premium increases of up to 77.3 percent in 2017. The forecast for next year is more desperate, which is why I support moving a solution forward that does something to protect care for people in the 14th District. Not only are these ACA plans more expensive, but insurers are seriously restricting choice to control escalating costs, refusing coverage for some of the best doctors and hospitals in northern Illinois. Thousands of individuals and families can no longer go to their trusted doctors or get care at their nearest hospital.  I have said repeatedly I will ensure people with pre-existing conditions are protected. Under the American Health Care Act (AHCA), insurance companies can never deny someone coverage based on pre-existing conditions. This legislation requires a state to meet very specific requirements if it chooses a waiver to deliver health care that is better tailored to the needs of its population. What people are forgetting is that this much criticized provision is similar to the State Innovation Waivers already granted by standing ACA law. The AHCA provides several layers of protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions in states that get an approved waiver, with rules in place to make sure those individuals have help affording their premiums and that they maintain continuous coverage to keep their costs down. No one can be charged more if they maintain continuous coverage. Today the House also passed H.R. 2192, which applies state waiver rules to Congress and congressional staff.  The AHCA also increases plan and network choice by encouraging states to use federal funds to promote participation in private insurance outside failing ACA exchanges, encourages Americans to take advantage of preventive care services and reduces costs in the individual market that have increased dramatically since the ACA took effect.  This bill is not the final product—it is not law. It is simply one solution that offers a way out of the restrictive, costly and unsustainable ACA and moves deliberations to the Senate for consideration. I have faith that the Senate will keep their eyes on what matters most for residents of Illinois, including improving access to affordable coverage and high-quality care regardless of health status, income or age. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues and the Trump administration to improve this legislation on the road ahead.","status",NA,NA,184,1566,91,10,1,3,48,839

Comprehensive tax reform is long overdue, and this bill provides significant relief to people in Illinois and across the country.  I am especially pleased the legislation includes my bill, the Bring Small Businesses Back Tax Reform Act, to cut the overall small business tax rate to 25 percent and provide much-needed relief to the engine of Illinois’ economy. Every time I meet with family-owned businesses and ask them what it would take to hire one more employee, they unanimously state fixing the tax code, among other issues.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to finalize a plan that includes municipal finance tax protections that preserve a key tax tool for funding local and state infrastructure projects like hospitals, roads and bridges. Our goal is a tax code that benefits and works for families, seniors, workers and job creators in the 14th District.

Worth the short read:  Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.  But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
