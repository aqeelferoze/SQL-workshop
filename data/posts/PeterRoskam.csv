Religious freedom is a cornerstone of our nation and the ability for all faiths to worship freely is sacred to our identity as Americans – no hateful acts of vandalism or violent threats can change that. This week we re-launched the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism for the 115th Congress.  On health care, the President reaffirmed his commitment not just to repealing Obamacare, but to responsibly replacing it with a better plan to provide access to affordable care for everyone. It is clear Obamacare has failed. Illinois families are paying more money for fewer and fewer benefits. Insurance premiums have increased by an average of over 21%. Last year, the Land of Lincoln co-op became the 16th in the country to collapse, leaving 49,000 Illinoisans without any healthcare coverage at all and taxpayers on for hook for over $160 million. I’m committed to developing a replacement plan that brings down costs and provides greater access to affordable care for Illinois families.  President Trump talked about the perverse incentives currently built into our tax code. We literally reward companies for shipping jobs overseas and then bringing their products back to sell in the United States. That’s why the Ways & Means Committee has put forward a plan to repeal the “made in America” tax. It will put American companies on a level playing field with the rest of the world: everyone will pay the same tax rate when they sell their products in the U.S. I’m honored to serve as Ways & Means Tax Policy Chairman in the 115th Congress and look forward to working with the administration to overhaul our tax code later this year.  It was also encouraging to hear President Trump’s renewed commitment to national defense. This needs to be matched with a redoubling of our diplomatic efforts to support democracy and human rights abroad. Adversarial regimes such as Iran and Russia continue to threaten our allies – we must show them the true meaning of American resolve. I pressured the last administration to do more to support our friends resisting the rising tide of Russian and Iranian aggression. I intend to do the same with this one.  Finally, I’m glad to see increased support for our men and women in uniform. I wholeheartedly support the President’s renewed commitment to our veterans. Nobody is more deserving of our support and care than those who have fought and bled for our country on the battlefield.","link","https://roskam.house.gov/Joint-Address-Response","roskam.house.gov",178,181,18,11,1,1,1,46

The spectacle that is the United States Congress is amazing to witness and a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  Through all the committee hearings and briefings, legislative business, policy analyses, Capitol Hill receptions and Presidential speeches, I could not have received a more eye-opening summer.  Congressman Roskam, a man of faith and integrity, reminded me that the government does not control we the people, but we the people control the government.  While interning on Capitol Hill, I gained invaluable and firsthand education on the process, structure and daily operations of the United States Federal Government. I met a great deal of prominent leaders in our nation today, among them, Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, John McCain, Kevin McCarthy and Ben Sasse just to name a few.  I not only walked in the footsteps of today's leaders, but historical leaders as well. While freely flashing my intern badge and walking the halls of the United States Capitol Building, I could not help but be humbled and exhilarated by thinking about those who came before me: Men and women among the likes of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Jeanette Rankin, Rosa Parks, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan.  I will be forever grateful for the opportunity Congressman Roskam bestowed upon me to help him serve the people of Illinois's 6th Congressional District. I recommend this internship to all students, regardless of race, creed, color, ethnicity, gender or political affiliation, for you will not be disappointed.  But most importantly, you will be reminded that out of many, we are one. E Pluribus Unum.""

The RESPECT Act is a big step toward delivering justice for victims of IRS abuse. It’s clear to everyone involved that the IRS and DOJ abused their authority and took money from people who did nothing wrong. With this legislation, we’re making sure they can never do it again. I want to thank the Clyde, Hirsch, Sowers, and Taylor families for their bravery and willingness to share their stories in the hopes of preventing future injustice. I appreciate the support of Congressman John Lewis, Rep. Joe Crowley and the Committee on Ways and Means on this bipartisan bill. I’m glad we can finally put this ugly chapter to rest.  https://roskam.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/house-votes-unanimously-end-irs-forfeiture-abuse","link","https://roskam.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/house-votes-unanimously-end-irs-forfeiture-abuse","roskam.house.gov",81,43,11,7,0,1,0,3

During her service, Captain Matthews served in combat zones as a surgical nurse and directed doctors, corpsmen and nursing staffs in new plastic surgery techniques. Since her retirement Captain Matthews has continued support for military and veterans organizations such as the American Legion Post 690 Palatine, the Sons of American Legion, Honor Flight and served as a member of the executive committee of the Veterans of Lake Barrington Shores. We are forever grateful for the service and sacrifice of Captain Matthews both as an active duty servicemember and as a veteran.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/PeterRoskam/photos/a.147005475313080.26940.118777661469195/1993278127352463/?type=3",NA,54,30,3,8,1,1,1,12

I'm excited to be a part of an historic movement to overhaul a broken tax code that has maintained a status quo that hurts American families.

Earlier this year, Democrats in Illinois were complicit in shoving through a massive state income tax hike that hurt middle-income families; this bill not only gives those families the tax relief they deserve, but it also gives small business owners the relief they need to grow their businesses and create new jobs. Watch my speech on the floor of the House  earlier today.","video","https://www.facebook.com/PeterRoskam/videos/2003941419619467/",NA,226,482,28,28,11,1,5,370

The increase in the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples – nearly double the amounts available today – will protect far more of every paycheck from taxes and make tax filing dramatically easier for the American people.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/PeterRoskam/photos/a.147005475313080.26940.118777661469195/2007071145973161/?type=3",NA,117,265,4,7,20,0,1,175
