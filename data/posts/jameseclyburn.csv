The site is one of the state’s most dangerous intersections featuring multiple railroad crossings which are adjacent to both Claflin and South Carolina State Universities.  I secured a total of $3.25 million in federal funds which will realign Zan Street, close two railroad crossings, and reconfigure the intersection to enhance vehicle and pedestrian safety.  This is a critical infrastructure project for Orangeburg, and I thank the leaders of the community for having the vision to make it a reality. http://bit.ly/2BvqMIW","status",NA,NA,54,16,3,8,1,0,0,1
