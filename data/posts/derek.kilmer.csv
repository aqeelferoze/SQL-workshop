We should be providing more opportunities for people to get quality, affordable healthcare – not taking care away from folks who need it. This debate is about people. People who have been able to get the treatments they need, or stay on their parents’ insurance, or families wrestling with the impact of the opioid crisis. It’s about every staff member and every patient at facilities like Olympic Medical Center and Hilltop Regional Health Center where the number of uninsured patients walking through the doors has dropped. The law isn’t perfect. We can and should look at constructive ways to reduce health care costs for seniors and families, invest in prevention, increase choices for consumers and streamline regulations.

Shipyard employees are essential to our nation’s defense and a big part of our community. That’s why my agenda includes fixes to policies like a lack of overtime for maintenance jobs overseas and the reduction in compensation when men and women have to travel for extended periods of time for their job. We touched on these issues and how I’ve been pressing President Trump to exempt our public shipyards from the hiring freeze. The announcement that 900 helper trainee positions opened this week in Bremerton is a start but we are going to keep at it. Finally, we also talked about my bill that would do away with a rule that doesn’t allow retired servicemembers to take a civilian defense job until 6 months after they retire.

This plan (known as the American Health Care Act or the AHCA for short) doesn’t pass the test of improving the system. The Congressional Budget Office today determined that the proposal would cause 24 million Americans to go without health insurance and it would raise premiums by 15 percent. It would do real damage to the Medicaid system that provides healthcare to lower-income Americans and their families and has covered cancer treatments for 20,000 people in Washington state alone. It hurts women’s health services that provide critical care, eliminates a key public health fund that invests in immunizations in our state, gives tax breaks to the wealthiest while setting us back in the fight against opioids and hurting seniors. Folks know that I’m willing to work with anyone – regardless of party – to try to make progress. But I’m really struck by how damaging this proposal is.

I’m deeply concerned that President Trump has not taken this approach. We know he has financial interests beyond American shores. But we don’t know where all of the President’s money comes from. Saying ‘trust me’ isn’t good enough. He should follow the standard set for all presidents in modern history and release his tax returns. We also need clear disclosure and divesture. Unfortunately, the President continued his pattern of secrecy by announcing today that visitor logs at the White House – which were made available by his predecessor – will not be open to the public. This is unacceptable.

This center is a win-win because it will show that the Peninsula can be a hub for groundbreaking innovation while giving folks the skills they need to build a career with composites. Recently, the center won the 2017 Washington Manufacturing Award from Seattle Business Magazine.

From what we’ve seen so far it’s not a blueprint for creating opportunity for everyone. Rather, it’s another example of President Trump breaking promises he made to the American people. There are bone deep cuts to initiatives that provide insurance so kids in our community can see a doctor, bring meals to seniors who might otherwise not get them, and invest in infrastructure that helps our rural communities grow and attract new businesses to Main Street. As Vice Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee, I will continue standing up against this plan and work with my colleagues on a budget that actually delivers for folks in our region and across the nation.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-to-propose-big-cuts-to-safety-net-in-new-budget-this-week/2017/05/21/62c01f44-3e34-11e7-adba-394ee67a7582_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_budget-0440pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.277c957515dd","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-to-propose-big-cuts-to-safety-net-in-new-budget-this-week/2017/05/21/62c01f44-3e34-11e7-adba-394ee67a7582_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_budget-0440pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.277c957515dd","washingtonpost.com",93,47,20,3,0,7,14,55

Today at a hearing with the Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, I asked why the administration thought eliminating federal support for the West Coast’s Early Earthquake Warning System was a good idea. Because a fully operational system could make the difference in keeping people safe if the big one hits. I also pointed out that our national parks are economic drivers on places like the Olympic Peninsula and deserve to have a good partner in the federal government to make sure facilities and trails can keep up with the millions of visitors spending time there.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/derek.kilmer/photos/a.451234788272550.101994.450819048314124/1420628981333121/?type=3",NA,200,22,17,26,0,0,0,2

Some people refer to the role she played diplomatically. They would say that she was a convener. I think we should call it what it is. She was fearless about corralling local elected officials, knocking them upside the head, and telling them to get their acts together.   There are very few people in this world who, simply by the potent combination of intelligence, kindness, sweetness, and delicious appetizers, could summon people of all parties, of all degrees of seniority to her home, and make things happen. What has always struck me about Dawn was her amazing ability to get things done. Not only did Dawn convene and simply persuade decision makers – but once she had her audience - she always made a clear case for action. And, the results are indisputable.   Whether it was the UWT campus, the Murray Morgan Bridge, or the development of Tacoma schools and the downtown core…there is no doubt that if it helped move Tacoma forward – Dawn probably put together a meeting to talk about it early on. While Dawn had some pretty amazing titles – Norm Dicks's Office Manager, City Council Member, Delegate to the United Nations Economic and Social Calendar – it is amazing what she was able to accomplish with the title of citizen.   She was such a passionate and energetic citizen of Tacoma. I am so grateful to Dawn for her contributions to this community, for her friendship, and for giving me plenty of good marching orders.  Tacoma will miss her terribly.    http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article155577859.html","link","http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article155577859.html","thenewstribune.com",142,11,17,16,0,1,51,0

We need to ensure that the millions of Americans paying back student loans have all tools available to keep them on the road to a balance of zero. But recently, the Department of Education decided to change requirements for student loans that help ensure borrowers don’t fall behind. These are noncontroversial standards like requiring servicers to present options to borrowers who can only make partial payments, notifying borrowers when payments are sent to the wrong address, or letting a borrower know when loans are transferred between servicers. We should not be doing away with these common sense rules.

The president's budget proposal completely eliminates this program even though it's working to help seniors and others pay for their home energy bills, provide aid in energy crises, and weatherization and energy-related home repairs. I sat down with Kitsap Community Resources (KCR) to talk about why it should not be zeroed out. A big thank you to Carol who welcomed us into her home to learn about how LIHEAP helped her weatherize her home; allowing her to reduce the health risks of unsafe heating and cooling practices.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/derek.kilmer/photos/a.451234788272550.101994.450819048314124/1451570881572264/?type=3",NA,115,32,13,7,0,1,15,1

I want to say thank you to every worker who has fought and won victories for better pay, better benefits, and safer workplaces. Our country is a better place when we value the contributions of every man and woman on the job – no matter their profession. This Labor Day, join me in celebrating the spirit and achievements of the American worker.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/derek.kilmer/photos/a.451234788272550.101994.450819048314124/1507212239341461/?type=3",NA,82,0,2,2,0,0,0,0

Earlier this year I met with a group of DREAMers in our region. A young woman attending high school in Bremerton told me she was brought here by her parents as a toddler. She built a life here and is thriving because of the opportunity was given. She said to me simply – “This is my home. I have no other home. I know no other country. If I’m deported where am I supposed to go?”   It’s a shame that the President has chosen to ignore questions like that. It’s a shame he’s willing to cause folks like this young woman so much heartache and uncertainty. It’s time for this Congress to come together and tell the President we can pass legislation that will strengthen our borders while giving young people who have never known any other home the chance to stay.","status",NA,NA,599,237,84,23,3,2,85,81

For me, trips there for hiking and camping have been a family staple since I was a kid. It’s a prime example of how our national parks aren’t just a place for folks to come and take in iconic landscapes. They are also job generators for the surrounding communities and are key to the ever growing outdoor economy. That’s why I’m troubled by a proposal from the Department of Interior to make it more expensive to visit. It’s true that our parks have seen a lot more wear and tear recently. But we shouldn’t put the burden of fixing them on the backs of hikers, bikers, and families bringing a vehicle in for the weekend. Instead, Congress should act on my bipartisan bill, the National Park Service Legacy Act, that would address the big maintenance backlog in a responsible way without raising the price to visit. https://www.seattletimes.com/life/outdoors/70-per-vehicle-to-go-to-a-national-park-big-fee-hike-proposed/  You can also tell the National Park Service your concern about hiking park fees here https://parkplanning.nps.gov/commentForm.cfm?documentID=83652","link","https://www.seattletimes.com/life/outdoors/70-per-vehicle-to-go-to-a-national-park-big-fee-hike-proposed/","seattletimes.com",229,141,104,6,2,16,47,102

Our tax code should be simplified so that folks don’t need to call a specialist to understand what it means. It should also prioritize competitive tax rates for businesses right here, rather than encouraging companies to go abroad. The earned income tax credit and child tax credit should be boosted. I’m also going to be fighting for benefits important to middle-class Washington state families like being able to contribute to 401K accounts and the state and local sales tax deduction. The benefits of tax reform should be fairly balanced so middle class taxpayers see the biggest benefit.

The Trump Administration’s analysis includes proposals to cut the things working families use to pull themselves up into the middle class to pay for the tax plan, and independent analysis continues to show the bill would add $1 trillion to the deficit. This is all to pay for the tax breaks primarily going to corporations and a handful of very wealthy families, while actually raising taxes for many middle class families. To me, that’s just wrong.

I am disappointed that rather than using these last few weeks to do their jobs and produce a long-term, bipartisan spending plan, the majority of Congress has decided to once again kick the can down the road. I remain committed to working with the members of both parties to pass a long-term, bipartisan spending plan.  Congress has punted from September to early-December, then to mid-December and now to January. No household would run their family finances three weeks at a time. No business would either.  These manufactured crises are certainly no way to run the government either.  That’s why I supported measures like No Budget No Pay, which would mean Congress wouldn’t be paid if the government is shutdown.  In January, Congress should get serious and pass a long-term, bipartisan deal. That’s overdue. Doing so would mean government agencies and the federal workforce has the assurances needed to make long-term plans, which saves taxpayer money, allows the military to maintain readiness, and prevents Americans from having the government services on which they rely held hostage by partisan politics.","status",NA,NA,357,124,24,15,2,3,31,5
