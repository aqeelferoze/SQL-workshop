Our coal miners have worked tirelessly over the last several decades to power this country. They earned these benefits and they don’t deserve to have them taken away.

Existing BOP regulations do not permit correctional officers like Lieutenant Albarati to carry their personal firearms while they commute to-and-from work.  This is a serious problem.   To address this, I have introduced bipartisan legislation with Representatives Tom Marino, Rick Nolan, and Tom Emmer that will help make sure this tragedy does not happen again. Our bill, the Lieutenant Osvaldo Albarati Correctional Self Protection Act directs the BOP to provide a secure storage area located outside the secure perimeter of a BOP facility for correctional officers to store personal firearms and allows employees to keep firearms in a vehicle lockbox approved by the BOP.   Let’s work together and gather support for this legislation. Our law enforcement officers put themselves in dangerous situations every day and they must be able to defend themselves.

At a time when we are trying to kick-start our economy and create new jobs, the last thing we need is a tax that will take money from the pocketbooks of middle class families.   There are three outcomes with the implementation of a carbon tax; a decrease in the production of fossil fuels that will lead to further job losses, an increase in energy costs for consumers, and a weakening of American competitiveness across the globe.  We should instead be focused on advancing a national energy policy that promotes efficiency and embraces all of our resources by using them in the cleanest way possible.

In addressing these concerns we made sure that we protect Americans with pre-existing conditions and allow younger Americans to stay on their parent's plan.    However, since the bill was introduce last week we have heard further concerns and I have shared these concerns with the Leadership in the House.  Contrary to some misleading reports Black Lung benefits will not be jeopardized under the proposed legislation. Those benefits will continue.   For those who gained coverage through Medicaid expansion, states will be provided with new flexibility and a transition period so no one has the rug pulled out from underneath them. States will also have an option to keep expanded eligibility in the future.   Finally, there are concerns of how older Americans and low income people could pay a lot more under the tax credit proposal. This is a serious concern of mine as well and our office is currently working with leaders in the House to modify the bill and provide better assistance for these people.   This bill is not a final product and it will continue to be amended and modified in both the House and Senate before being sent to President Trump.  One thing is certain; the current system has failed the American people and is completely unsustainable. Premiums are soaring, deductibles are skyrocketing, and choices are limited.   The American people deserve access to affordable, quality healthcare coverage and I look forward to working towards that goal.","status",NA,NA,29,45,12,2,0,0,1,5

Unfortunately, CMS’s misguided rule jeopardizes the ability of rural hospitals to provide vital services. This would have a huge impact on West Virginia hospitals’ ability to provide affordable care. We led a bipartisan letter to CMS with nearly 250 signers, urging them to reconsider, but they didn’t listen. This bill ensures that hospitals are able to continue providing affordable services, and gives rural families peace of mind.","link","https://www.axios.com/bipartisan-bill-would-halt-cuts-to-hospitals-drug-subsidies-2509725144.html?utm_medium=linkshare&utm_campaign=organic","axios.com",7,31,1,0,0,0,0,0

America is now much more deeply involved in global competition; therefore, it’s time to reform our tax system. This reform will bring some much-needed relief to the middle-class. We must make our code simpler and fairer, and this bill removes special interest loopholes, reduces rates, and makes it so that most families can file their taxes on a postcard. It will also increase America’s competitiveness on the world stage, and open the door for private sector job creation.   Our office successfully worked to preserve clean coal research credits in the House legislation. We are expecting the Historic Preservation Tax Credit to be included in the final version.  We have a clear choice here: do we allow the status quo to continue, which only benefits the wealthy and politically connected? Or do we allow the process to continue and fight to ensure the final version is the best deal possible for the middle class and small employers?  This is a process, and today we voted to move forward to the next step. Some issues still need to be resolved in the final bill, and we will be closely monitoring the negotiations.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepMcKinley/photos/a.130614043672264.23124.130377260362609/1550597281673926/?type=3",NA,23,46,3,4,1,1,0,25
