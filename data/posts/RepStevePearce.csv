The Select Panel on Infant Lives sent their first criminal referral in June of 2016 and, after finding more evidence of violations in the procedures of fetal tissue procurement by the University of New Mexico and Southwestern Women‚Äôs Options, sent their second criminal referral in December 2016.  Full statement below. Please share if you, too, believe we need to escalate this critical issue.  :::: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Todd Willens                                               Tel. 202-225-2365 Email: Pearce.Media@mail.house.gov   Pearce Urges UNM Board of Regents, New Mexico Attorney General to Uphold Laws and Respect for Human Life   Washington, DC (January 6, 2017) Congressman Steve Pearce released the following statement after the second criminal referral to New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas was made by the U.S. House Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, imploring state and university leaders to address the serious violations uncovered by the Panel‚Äôs investigation.    ‚ÄúThe entire report released by the Select Panel raises serious concerns of ethical and legal violations occurring at UNM and Southwestern Women‚Äôs Options. Most troubling though is their complete disregard for regulations put in place by lawmakers to protect women and children. UNM and SWWO have created a culture where obtaining baby body parts, deceiving patients, and maintaining faculty perks are higher priorities than following laws and basic healthcare principles,‚Äù said Pearce.   During the Select Panel‚Äôs investigation an employee of SWWO and faculty member of UNM admitted that she had never received proper consent from a patient for the harvesting of baby body parts, and further acknowledged that she did not recognize the consent form SWWO and UNM provided to the Panel. Another faculty member from UNM admitted that there is no procedure in place to handle infants who are born alive during an abortion, and confirmed that there have been instances of infants exiting the womb before expected.  When asked if she was familiar with the Born-Alive Infant Protection Act, she responded that she was not familiar and that she did not understand the relevancy to her practice.   ‚ÄúI am here to remind UNM, SWWO, and NM Attorney General Hector Balderas that respecting human life is relevant. I am here to remind them that as a taxpayer funded institution, upholding the law and punishing violators is relevant.  In the UNM Health Sciences Center Code of Ethics, Dr. Paul Roth writes that, ‚ÄòIn order to maintain public trust and accountability, we adhere to the highest ethical standards and compliance in all research activities.‚Äô  So I ask Dr. Roth, the UNM Board of Regents, NM Attorney General Hector Balderas and the taxpayers of our state; is it ethical to disregard procedures that check for signs of life, such as looking for a heartbeat or giving an Apgar test? Is it ethical for UNM to obtain the body parts of aborted babies, including baby brains for a high school summer camp dissection project, without proper consent? Is it ethical to leave a baby to die without care or acknowledgement in the name of research?   We have reached a critical point where UNM and the NM Attorney General must decide if the rule of law applies to everyone, or if they will remain silent and let the negligence of laws and human life become the status quo. The laws of fetal tissue procurement are exact and prescriptive, and by their own admission UNM and SWWO either don‚Äôt know the laws or don‚Äôt care about them. It is time for the leaders of UNM and the New Mexico Attorney General to ensure that illegal and unethical conduct at the expense of innocent New Mexicans is investigated and met with just punishment.‚Äù","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepStevePearce/photos/a.183861418304050.38430.180280568662135/1279187995438048/?type=3",NA,57,9,61,1,0,2,3,0

As I have said for decades, WIPP is successful because of the community that supports it. Their dedication and hard work has made today's grand re-opening possible.  I issued the following statement to correspond with the official reopening of the Department of Energy‚Äôs (DOE) Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM:   ‚ÄúFirst and foremost, I would like to thank the highly trained professional workforce that allows WIPP to be successful, as well as the local community in Carlsbad for their enduring support for this project,‚Äù said Pearce. ‚ÄúI would also like to thank Secretary Moniz and Chairman Simpson. Secretary Moniz has been a true friend and ally to WIPP and the Carlsbad community throughout the recovery process. Chairman Simpson has worked closely with my office to ensure that WIPP had the funding it needed both to recover and retain its critical workforce. WIPP is an extremely valuable site for New Mexico and the United States, as it provides a number of well-paying jobs in the local community and an invaluable service for our nation. Moving forward, safety will remain a priority, but I have great confidence in the highly trained professional workforce at the site and the strong support within the community. I look forward to working with the DOE, the state, and the local community to ensure this facility remains operational.‚Äù   U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz released the following statement after the reopening:   ‚ÄúThe tireless efforts by the workforce, the contractor and federal management and the community to make WIPP a safer place to fulfill its critical mission is a remarkable feat. Their continued work to enable environmental cleanup in DOE host communities across the country exemplifies the American tradition of rising up to overcome our most technically complex challenges,‚Äù said Secretary Moniz. ‚ÄúThe Department remains committed to safely and responsibly cleaning up the legacy of the Cold War. And, with continuing cooperation with our local partners and the State of New Mexico, WIPP will once again help meet that mission.‚Äù   The complex, first opened in 1999, was designed as a safe, long-term solution for TRU waste which mostly consists of debris, soil, clothing, tools, rags, residues, and other items that can be contaminated with radioactive elements from nuclear weapons research and testing operations of past defense activities. The ability to resume operations strengthens America‚Äôs overall energy security as it reestablishes a safe and environmentally protective method to properly manage nuclear waste from defense-related activities.   The workforce at WIPP successfully completed the first waste emplacement operations on Wednesday, January 4, 2017 with waste from the Savannah River Site that had been recertified and stored in the Waste Handling Building (WHB). All recertified waste from the WHB will be emplaced prior to accepting new waste shipments from generator sites to WIPP. DOE expects to resume shipments to WIPP in spring 2017.  A schedule for waste shipments has not been finalized, but it is expected that the facility will slowly and safely ramp up to approximately five shipments a week later this year.

Last Friday, after a senseless act of violence, law enforcement officers at the Fort Lauderdale, Florida international airport acted without hesitation to secure the area and usher civilians to safety.  In New Mexico, we too, have felt the loss and pain of our own brothers and sisters of Law Enforcement.   In 2016, nationally, we lost 135 members of law enforcement. That is a 10 percent increase over 2015. Even more alarming, there was a 56 percent increase in firearm‚Äìrelated officer fatalities last year and one-third of shooting deaths were ambush-style attacks‚Äî the highest total in more than two decades.**  At a time when loss is great, and the job is not easy, I truly want to invite you to take a special moment with me today and thank our brothers and sisters in law enforcement, from the bottom of our hearts, for putting on the uniform, answering their calling, and going to work everyday in one of the most noble professions of our time.  Thank you friends, thank you family, thank you neighbors, thank you all. It is because of you that our children feel safer on the playgrounds, that we feel safer in our homes, and we go to bed and sleep a little sounder at night.   It is also important to thank the family and friends of our law enforcement officers, because, law enforcement is familial calling.

I hope the incoming Administration takes us off this dangerous path by making it a priority to fill these positions with professionals who understand these issues and understand the importance of local cooperation,‚Äù said Chairman Emeritus Congressman Steve Pearce","link","https://westerncaucus-gosar.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/western-caucus-members-send-president-elect-trump-letter-regarding","esterncaucus-gosar.house.gov",39,4,0,3,0,0,0,0

Congratulations, friends. This is great news.  :::::  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Todd Willens                                               Tel. 202-225-2365 Email: Pearce.Media@mail.house.gov  This afternoon, the House of Representatives voted on S.Con.Res. 3, which sets up the repeal process for the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Congressman Pearce issued the following statement in response to the passage of the resolution:   ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs vote is the first step in repealing and replacing Obamacare,‚Äù said Pearce. ‚ÄúThe resolution had two purposes: to declare a budget for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2017, and to set in motion the process to repeal Obamacare. While I have strong concerns with the underlying budget included in this bill, it is essential to create a healthcare plan that works. In New Mexico, we have seen increased prices, decreased choice, and a refusal to be able to see the physician of our choice. As I have said time and again, I remain committed to repealing this harmful law and replacing it with a healthcare system that works for the American people. The American people have entrusted us with fixing this disastrous law and I look forward to working with my colleagues to replace it with something better for New Mexico and the nation.‚Äù","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepStevePearce/photos/a.183861418304050.38430.180280568662135/1284313928258788/?type=3",NA,142,65,42,15,0,1,0,17

First, the EPA came into our communities and caused a major toxic spill into our river system and water source. It then attempted to claim that the water was safe again before it was and also tried to deny any responsibility for the disaster. Now, the agency wants to abandon those it impacted and not pay for the damage caused to avoid negative press.   This is absolutely disgusting. The Obama Administration has allowed Administrator McCarthy run amok. No matter the Administration, the west MUST begin to hold the executive agencies accountable. I am glad to see my Democrat colleagues are outraged as well and hope they join with me to hold these agencies accountable. I will continue to fight to make sure that New Mexicans are compensated for damage done, and for the state to take over remediation efforts as the EPA has lost all accountability in our state.‚Äù   http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a8ae2e2996d745a3944912968742a948/apnewsbreak-epa-says-it-cant-pay-damages-mine-spill","link","http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a8ae2e2996d745a3944912968742a948/apnewsbreak-epa-says-it-cant-pay-damages-mine-spill","bigstory.ap.org",87,45,179,0,0,8,4,85

As a veteran, I strongly support cutting government red tape that prevents former service members from receiving quality and timely care they deserve, especially after they sacrificed so much to defend the freedoms we hold close. One of the bills that passed was the WINGMAN Act, a bill I co-sponsored, which makes it easier for veteran advocates to gain information and resources they need to help veterans.","link","http://pearce.house.gov/press-release/pearce-votes-improve-lives-veterans","pearce.house.gov",64,7,7,4,0,0,0,0

He worked diligently through school to get into college, and worked nights and weekends to pay his way through law school. However, Ali‚Äôs immigration status kept him from landing his dream job of becoming a lawyer. It‚Äôs these exceptional, hard-working young individuals that I‚Äôve introduced legislation to provide certainty for.   Congress only has about three months left before the DACA program will come to an end, leaving nearly 800,000 young people in fear that they might have to leave the only home they know. My bill is just one part of reforming our immigration system, and provides a middle-ground solution that can profoundly change the lives of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants.
