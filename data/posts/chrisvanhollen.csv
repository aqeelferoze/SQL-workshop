In this great legislative body, Senators across the political spectrum have a long history of coming together to keep our nation safe, to ensure our children, seniors, and veterans are cared for, and to promote policies that create American jobs. In that tradition, we should use the opportunity of a new year and a new Congress to focus on issues that bring the American people together and make our nation and economy stronger.  Unfortunately, on the first day of this session, the GOP leadership chose not to focus on issues that unite us, but instead launched a process that tramples on the rights of Marylanders and is designed to dismantle the Affordable Care Act without presenting any alternative. This isn’t only irresponsible, it’s downright dangerous for those who would lose their access to health coverage. And it would hurt every taxpayer by adding trillions to the deficit.  So I implore my Senate colleagues to examine their conscience and carefully consider the impact of putting their constituents at risk.  I am honored by the faith Marylanders have placed in me to represent them in this great body. I pledge to them – and to all Americans – that I will strive every day to work for the common good of all people.","video","https://www.facebook.com/chrisvanhollen/videos/10154444353953878/",NA,1529,233,223,116,1,4,14,1

Before the ACA, one of Dr. Wen’s patients couldn’t afford expensive seizure medication for his young son. The boy suffered a catastrophic seizure and died. Our system failed him, but we passed the ACA to give families the protections and care they need to prevent such tragedies.

Nominees must be judged based on whether their life's work demonstrates a commitment to meeting the mission of the office they are asked to lead. The Latin motto on the Department of Justice's seal refers to the Attorney General as the one ‘who prosecutes on behalf of justice.’ The Attorney General must be the people’s lawyer and be zealous in the pursuit of justice for all Americans. After reviewing the record of Senator Sessions, I am not convinced that he will be a vigorous defender of the rights of all Americans, especially those who have fallen victim to the powerful or the status quo.   Long before I considered running for elected office myself, I had the honor of working for Senator Mac Mathias of Maryland. In 1986, despite being a member of the Republican Party, Senator Mathias was one of the deciding votes against then U.S. Attorney Sessions' nomination for a federal judgeship.   Since then, Senator Sessions’ statements and actions have done little to reassure Americans. On the contrary, his record of words and deeds—with respect to civil rights, voting rights, women's rights,  LGBT rights, and the rights of individuals with disabilities—reveal that he too often sides with the powerful and the status quo rather than standing up for justice for all. We need an Attorney General who will apply the law to make more real the promise of equal rights and equal justice in America, and the record to date indicates that Senator Sessions fails to meet that important test.   In addition, I am deeply troubled by the positions Senator Sessions has taken on issues related to immigration reform and I am not persuaded that he would be an independent check on an incoming President who has made clear that he is prepared to trample the rights of immigrants and religious minorities.   For all these reasons, while I respect Senator Sessions' record of service to his state in the Senate for 20 years, I do not believe he should serve as our next Attorney General.","status",NA,NA,794,144,63,92,1,0,2,5

He has been a puppet for Big Oil and rejects the basic science of climate change. Putting him in charge of the EPA would violate the common wisdom that you don't ask a fox to guard the hen house. I oppose his nomination to lead the EPA.   In addition to being a natural treasure, the Chesapeake Bay is a key lifeline for Maryland's economy – for tourism, the boating industry, and the watermen who harvest the bounty of the Bay. The EPA plays a critical role in protecting the health of the Bay watershed. Yet, as the Attorney General of the landlocked state of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt sued the EPA to undermine our Bay cleanup efforts. Fortunately, the courts rejected this interference and our cleanup work continues. But based on his record, we cannot trust Mr. Pruitt be a good federal partner in our mission to protect the Bay.  This is just one piece of Attorney General Pruitt’s long history of opposing efforts to protect our air, our water, and the environment. Former Republican EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman summed it up well when she said, ‘I don’t recall ever having seen an appointment of someone who is so disdainful of the agency and the science behind what the agency does.’  As we consider nominations, we must ask this most basic question: will the nominee faithfully carry out the mission of the office to which he or she has been nominated?

With that in mind, the Department of Education is charged with one of America’s most critical tasks – providing all children, in every neighborhood, from pre-K to college, with the tools they need to reach their dreams. It is a department that needs strong leadership with a clear vision. And after this week’s confirmation hearing, it is apparent that Betsy DeVos is not the right person for the job.  Mrs. DeVos displayed a concerning lack of knowledge about some of the most important issues in the education community, from how to measure student progress to how to make college more affordable. We must do much more to strengthen our schools, but her belief that we should prioritize school voucher programs and for-profit charter schools above public education is a convenient excuse for not investing adequate resources in our public schools. Her refusal to unequivocally state that she would enforce protections for children with disabilities was appalling. And her cavalier response on the issue of guns in schools deeply disturbed me.    I do not believe that she has the experience necessary to manage such a vital agency or the demonstrated commitment to equal access to a high-quality education for every child.

Rather than take the time to understand agency budgets and make informed decisions, the President has decided to forbid agencies from bringing new talent into the civilian workforce. This will jeopardize critical missions like securing our borders, conducting oversight of federal programs, providing Social Security benefits, and monitoring the safety of our food supply. The size of each federal agency’s workforce should rise or fall based on the priority of their missions, not an arbitrary freeze.

Unlike some of the men and women up for consideration, Steve Mnuchin has experience working with banks. But that experience is some of the most troubling part of his record.  Last week, I had the opportunity to listen to families who had been mistreated by Steve Mnuchin’s bank, OneWest. They each told a different story, but the overall impact was clear – at every turn, OneWest chose to foreclose on homes instead of working with these Americans to keep a roof over their heads. Mr. Mnuchin’s bank was actually nicknamed a ‘foreclosure machine.’   At the height of the housing crisis, my Congressional office was flooded with calls from Marylanders who were in desperate need of help, up against some banks that were only interested in profit, and had nowhere else to turn. We were able to work with many families to help them keep their homes – but that work is not over, and communities in my state and across the country are still recovering. To install someone as the Secretary of the Treasury who engaged in such predatory lending practices and profited off the misery of others is deeply concerning. In recent testimony before a forum of outside witnesses about Mr. Mnuchin’s nomination, an expert witness described OneWest’s abuses as among the worst of the worst.  Mr. Mnuchin’s nomination also represents an astonishing about-face of President Trump’s campaign promise to drain the swamp. Despite campaign-trail promises of openness, Mr. Mnuchin failed to list $100 million in assets in his financial disclosure forms and to disclose his connections to an investment fund in the tax-haven Cayman Islands. And while he claims tax reform should prioritize middle class families, as Secretary of the Treasury he would be charged with implementing a Republican agenda that favors special interests and the ultra-wealthy over everyone and everything else.  The Secretary of the Treasury must do what’s best for American taxpayers, workers, and homeowners. Given his record, I do not believe Mr. Mnuchin meets that standard and I oppose his nomination.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/chrisvanhollen/photos/a.10150684106803878.409441.109304033877/10154501942693878/?type=3",NA,640,143,112,45,0,5,5,99

My father served in the Foreign Service at the Department of State, so I spent some of my early years overseas. I was proud to be part of a family that represented our great Country. I learned firsthand the critical role of our Nation’s diplomats, the risks that they take to serve our Country, and the part that they play in spreading American ideals of freedom and democracy around the world.  The State Department reaches across the world, advancing our interests, shaping our relationships, advocating for human rights, and working to advance peace. But it is a department that has been deeply shaken by President Trump’s dangerous rhetoric and damaging policies. He has fawned over Russian President Vladimir Putin and empowered Russia’s increasingly aggressive behavior. He has wavered on our commitment to NATO, gratuitously escalated arguments with China and Mexico, and questioned the reality of climate change. And his executive order barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the United States undermines our values and plays into the hands of ISIS and other enemies.   The Secretary of State must play a crucial role in maintaining relationships between the United States and our allies around the world. Mr. Trump’s statements and actions highlight the need for a Secretary of State who will push back against President Trump’s worst impulses – but nothing in Mr. Tillerson’s record indicates he’ll offer that much-needed balance.   Given Russia’s interference with U.S. elections and Russia’s increased provocation of our allies, we need to be able to rely on our Secretary of State to advance U.S. interests above all. Mr. Tillerson’s close relationship with Vladimir Putin casts doubt on his ability and inclination to pursue additional sanctions as necessary and on the quality of advice that he will give the President.   I am also concerned that Mr. Tillerson does not seem to view human rights as a critical issue for the State Department. In addition to refusing to condemn Russian and Syrian atrocities as war crimes, he did not condemn Philippine President Duterte’s extrajudicial killings. This is particularly disturbing, as President Duterte has alleged that President Trump approves of his actions. Mr. Tillerson’s lack of focus on human rights and the rule of law indicate that he seems not to appreciate the role of America in the world.   Finally, I seriously question Mr. Tillerson’s commitment to working with our allies and cosigners of the Paris Climate Agreement to confront one of our greatest global challenges.   Given his extensive ties to Russia and questionable commitment to advancing human rights and combatting climate change, I do not believe that Mr. Tillerson is the right person for this job.","status",NA,NA,3011,433,116,236,0,2,20,11

He has issued an executive order that made it harder for people to afford a mortgage, opposed efforts to provide middle-class Americans overtime pay, and taken steps to end efforts to better protect Americans’ retirement savings from abusive practices. And he has made our nation less safe by insulting our allies, fawning over our adversaries, and playing into the hands of ISIS and other enemies.

Those changes include laws to ensure that women receive equal pay for equal work, and tax credits and programs to provide more families access to affordable child care. We should also ensure that workers have earned paid sick leave because you shouldn't have to worry about missing a rent payment if you get sick. I am working on all these initiatives in the Senate.

After carefully evaluating Neil Gorsuch’s record and his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, I have concluded that he applies a cramped reading of the law and consistently sides with powerful special interests against the rights of individuals, workers, and consumers. When he had an opportunity during the hearings to clarify that bias, he chose instead to evade questions and answered with platitudes, not substance. While he is undoubtedly a skilled lawyer, his bias in favor of corporate power, coupled with his refusal to answer reasonable questions, lead me to conclude that he falls outside the judicial mainstream. The case that the Supreme Court decided in the middle of his hearing illustrates the point: The current Supreme Court Justices unanimously rejected his reasoning against the right of individuals with disabilities to receive an equal education. For all these reasons, I will oppose his nomination.  After the Senate’s unprecedented abdication of constitutional responsibility with respect to the Garland nomination, we must begin to restore faith in the Supreme Court. That requires a nominee who is widely viewed to be an impartial administrator of justice—someone who is truly in the mainstream and who can earn the support of at least 60 senators. I will insist that this nominee be held to that standard.  The decisions of the nine individuals with lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court have a direct impact on who we are as Americans and the future of our democracy. We have witnessed a series of 5-to-4 decisions that shape the character of our nation. We have seen the Court run roughshod over large majorities in the Congress to gut an important provision of the Voting Rights Act. In Citizens United, we watched the Court trample over statutes and ample Supreme Court precedent to empower corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money to elect representatives who will do their bidding. And a single vote gave individuals the right to marry the person they love.  With so much at stake, we need a nominee who can give the country confidence that he or she will be impartial. Donald Trump, however, demanded the opposite. He established a litmus test for his nominee, insisting on someone who opposed a woman’s right to reproductive choice and someone who would satisfy the National Rifle Association.

And after careful evaluation of Judge Gorsuch’s record and testimony, I have concluded that he does not pass that bar.   He has consistently sided with powerful special interest against the rights of individuals, workers, and consumers. That is probably not surprising given that Donald Trump picked him off a list presented by right-wing interest groups and established a litmus test, saying that he wanted someone who does not support women’s reproductive freedom and would make the National Rifle Association happy.

We must stop them.  Most large companies offer their employees access to retirement savings vehicles like 401(k)s, many small and medium-sized businesses to not have the infrastructure to offer these plans to their employees. As a result, about 55 million working Americans do not have access to these tax-preferred saving plans. The good news is the Obama Administration issued a rule giving states the ability to fill the void by establishing platforms to give these employees access to 401(k)-like plans.   I’m proud to say that Maryland is one of five states that developed a program to make it easier for workers to access these plans to save for retirement. Thanks to this program more than a million Marylanders are now able to save for their retirements more easily, and small and medium-sized business owners can focus on running their businesses.  Apparently, some powerful special interests have been working to deny workers access to these state-facilitated platforms and Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans are doing their bidding. The House has already voted to take away these retirement opportunities and the Senate will vote as early as today to take away the right of states and cities to create programs like these to help their citizens.  We must do everything we can to stop them from stripping access to these saving opportunities from millions of hardworking Americans.","video","https://www.facebook.com/chrisvanhollen/videos/10154685731053878/",NA,293,55,165,5,1,37,9,114

I’m pleased to report that this week we passed a budget plan that not only avoids a government shutdown but also is a big win for Marylanders: It includes funding for key priorities like the Chesapeake Bay Program, medical research at the NIH, operations at the Port of Baltimore, Community Development Block Grants for local economic development, the Purple Line transit system, WMATA, the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and important rural programs.","link","https://medium.com/@ChrisVanHollen/the-first-battle-of-the-budgets-trump-cuts-were-pushed-back-and-marylanders-won-38f54579118f","medium.com",507,58,27,38,3,0,0,1

I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to defeat the Trump budget cuts so we can continue to improve the health of the Bay.

There are common sense actions we can take to improve them, but we won’t improve the exchanges by cut slashing Medicaid by $834 billion and cutting tax credits that make care more affordable.

The President is also abdicating responsibility to protect communities in Maryland and across the country from the costly threats of drought, wildfire, storms, and sea level rise.

Ken wrote:  “I, along with millions of people with disabilities, have proven the doctors wrong! We can be employed, we can have relationships and families, we can own a house, we can live in the community, we can live the lives we want to live.  None of this would be possible if I did not have Medicaid funding to pay for the staff I need to help me with all my daily living activities. It’s scary to think what my life would look like if Medicaid was cut or a cap to states. Will I have to pick what services I need the most, or even worse, would I have to go into a state residential center or a nursing facility to get the essential daily living supports that I need?”   Like many people with disabilities who were born 40 or 50 years ago, the doctors told Ken’s parents to put him in an institution because he wouldn’t be able to function in society.  But, with the help of Medicaid, he and his parents were able to benefit from services that he needed not just to survive, but to live the life he wants to live.

He could provide the transparency of releasing his tax returns, as the Presidents have done for the last 40 years—again, he refused.

Two years ago I had the honor of playing a small role in helping our country open a new relationship with Cuba when President Obama invited me to fly to Havana to bring home my constituent Alan Gross, who had been imprisoned there for nearly five years. Alan did not ask to shape history. He was unjustly swept up in the conflict between the U.S. and Cuba. But, in the end, Alan proved to be a catalyst for change. Alan was not only thrilled to be free but also openly welcomed the Obama Administration's approach to Cuba and its people. Since that time, the slow, but steady progress that has taken place in our relationship has helped both Americans and the Cuban people. President Trump’s new policy turns back the clock, slows the progress toward greater openness and brings back old rhetoric associated with the same policy of isolationism that failed for five decades.

The Trump Administration's proposal to eliminate EPA's funding for the Bay would put the progress we have made at risk. That is why I am pleased by the bipartisan opposition in the Congress to the Trump proposal. The Washington Post story below shows why EPA's involvement is so important. More than half of the fresh water in the Bay comes down the Susquehanna River from Pennsylvania, and our witnesses last week estimated that about as much pollution comes into the Bay from the Susquehanna as from all other sources combined. EPA's involvement will be essential to securing the cooperation of officials and stakeholders there. I have already discussed this matter with members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation, but without the EPA, we have little leverage.

It's outrageous that President Trump is wasting taxpayer dollars as part of this charade, but has failed to fully acknowledge that the Russian government organized hackers to launch cyber-attacks on our state and local electoral systems—something that has been unanimously recognized by all the American Intelligence agencies.    What’s even more troubling is that President Trump’s “Commission on Election Integrity” has now called on states to provide sensitive voter information and data, including names, addresses, dates of birth, political parties, voter histories, and the last four digits of millions of Americans' social security numbers. That’s why Senator Amy Klobuchar and I sent a letter to the Commission’s chairman Vice President Pence and vice-chairman Kansas’ Secretary of State Chris Kobach requesting further information about how the Commission intends to use and protect this data. At a time when cybersecurity should be a top priority, it’s critical that we raise these serious privacy and safety concerns.   Maryland, along with 43 other states, share our concern, including Republican officials from Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio. What’s astounding is even vice-chair Kobach, has indicated that officials from his own state of Kansas will not fully comply with the Commission’s request. Instead of demanding that states hand over sensitive personal information, President Trump should hold Vladimir Putin accountable for attacking our democratic process.

Susan is a 63-year-old retired union electrician, dog rescuer and all-around animal lover who was willing to speak out to help protect affordable health care for our fellow Americans. Back in 2011, doctors discovered a cyst in Susan’s brain that developed into a tumor. In order to save her life, she had to undergo surgery. It took about a year of rehabilitation for Susan to be somewhat functional, but sadly, because of permanent damage that affected her balance, she was left unable to work again.  But the fight didn’t end there for Susan—she had to continue carrying the burden of the steep medical costs associated with her surgery and rehabilitation. The hospital bills alone were over $100,000. But fortunately, she was able to receive the critical care she needed because she was covered under the Affordable Care Act’s employer-based insurance market protections.  For Susan and hundreds of thousands like her with a pre-existing condition, the new Senate Republican health care bill is even worse than the first one. The provision added by Senator Ted Cruz allows insurance companies to segregate the market into those who feel they are invincible (they can purchase cheaper ""junk insurance"" plans only to discover their insurance doesn't cover their unexpected needs) and those who expect to need decent coverage. Individuals like Susan with any kind of pre-existing conditions will see huge, unaffordable price spikes. Even insurance companies concede the Cruz amendment will throw much of the insurance market into a death spiral.   We must stop this assault on common decency.

Instead of trying to make pork-barrel back room deals—like the Kodiak Kickback for Alaska—to entice wavering Senate Republican to vote for this unconscionable bill, Senator McConnell should use this additional time to hold public hearings to listen to individuals who will be impacted by the bill. If McConnell is proud of this proposal, why not invite public testimony from health care advocates, doctors, nurses and patient advocacy groups? Why not hear from impartial experts about the impact of the Ted Cruz amendment to segregate the insurance market? The answer is that he doesn't want the American people to hear the truth because the more they know, the more they hate the plan. Please join me in calling upon Senator McConnell to stop the back room deals to deny affordable care to millions of Americans and, instead, open the hearing rooms to testimony from the American public.

Just yesterday, President Trump and Senator McConnell called upon Senate Republicans to immediately repeal and then later replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  They clearly need to read today's nonpartisan analysis from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which says that plan would cause premiums to double and 32 million more Americans to be uninsured by 2026.  After the emergency meeting today between President Trump and Senate Republicans, McConnell announced that he will hold a vote next week to consider one or all of the rotten proposals that have been put forward to date—including immediate repeal. This is totally out of control and no way to treat the health care of our fellow Americans. It is time for President Trump and Senate Republicans to stop trying to destroy the ACA and start working with Democrats to strengthen our health care system for all Americans.    This battle is still not over. The Senate Republican leadership will try every trick in the book to pull a fast one. We need you to stay in the fight.

Enslaved at birth in Talbot County, he grew to become a national leader in the fight to end slavery and gain the right to vote for women. In his 20’s Douglass escaped slavery and eventually fled to England. In 1846 British Quakers raised funds to pay for his freedom and he returned home to the United States. He became one of the greatest orators, writers and social reformers in American history. His autobiography, ""Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave,"" was a bestseller during his lifetime and Frederick Douglass played a central role in the abolitionist movement and became a world renowned leader in the fight to end the evil institution of slavery.    I’m proud to introduce the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission Act in the Senate as a companion bill to legislation introduced in the House of Representatives by House of Representatives by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton and Congressman Andy Harris. This legislation would establish a commission to honor and celebrate Frederick Douglass in 2018 as we mark the 200th anniversary of his birth—and will explore how we can celebrate his legacy and redouble our efforts to build an ever more perfect union.","link","http://bsun.md/2uLFk6Q","bsun.md",910,60,110,119,4,0,1,2

We shared ideas about how Congress can support one of our fast-growing economic engines—Maryland agriculture.  Yesterday I had the chance to put some of their ideas to work when the Senate Appropriations Committee met to vote on the budget for agriculture and conservation programs. I am pleased that—on a bipartisan basis—we unanimously rejected many of the very deep cuts that the President's budget had proposed to make in rural areas. The Committee strongly supported investments that are important to farmers and help protect the Chesapeake Bay, like the Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) program. Through CTA, the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) field staff work one-on-one with farmers in Maryland and other states to develop and implement conservation plans that address how farmers can best conserve resources on their farms. I am also pleased that the Committee supported strong funding for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS)—which is headquartered in Beltsville and has facilities in Frederick. Their work provides essential support that helps farmers and consumers alike.  I am also thrilled to report that every member of the Committee—Democrat and Republican alike—voted to restore key rural development funding for the Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program and important rural energy programs—projects that the Trump Administration had proposed to eliminate entirely.

Senate Republican Leader McConnell is pleading with his Republican Caucus to allow us to move forward on a bill—he just can't tell them what that health care bill will be. It could be the proposal to wipe out the Affordable Care Act (ACA)—even though the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) just informed us that would cause premiums to double and 32 million Americans would lose access to affordable care. Or, it could be the latest version of their plan to ""replace"" the ACA. Yesterday, the CBO told us that plan was just as bad as the earlier version. In fact, it is worse because it contains Senator Cruz’s amendment that will provide junk insurance for some and skyrocketing, unaffordable costs for others, especially those with pre-existing conditions.  All of these plans are rotten to the core. All of them have the same DNA—they strip away affordable care from many in order to give tax breaks to a powerful few. So we cannot let our guard down until we defeat and bury them. We are fighting for mothers like Angela, April, and countless others who stay awake at night worrying about how they’ll care for their children or loved ones without access to affordable health care.

Over 70 million Americans rely on Medicaid’s vital services, including the millions of Americans living with a disability. In the past, many people with disabilities were shunted into grim institutions and often denied basic human rights. The Medicaid program has allowed individuals with disabilities to live independently and with dignity in our community. It has also allowed individuals to get the life-saving treatment they need. The deep cuts to Medicaid cuts will put these individuals at risk, all to give tax cuts to powerful corporations and the wealthiest Americans.

However, many of them learned the hard way that their catastrophic coverage did not include flooding. The owners of the Southwest Connection and Fudge Shop on Main Street, for example, learned that their ""business interruption"" insurance policy covered civil unrest, fires, or an earthquake, but it did not cover losses from a flood.

This Act imposes tough economic penalties on Russia for its interference in our elections. Critically, the legislation prevents President Trump—who has repeatedly demonstrated his admiration for Vladimir Putin—from removing sanctions on Russia without the approval of the Congress. It sends a clear and unequivocal message to the Kremlin: the United States will not tolerate attacks on our democracy.  North Korea's increasingly aggressive and provocative actions also demand a strong response. Just last week North Korea fired another ballistic missile that experts say had the capacity to reach the U.S. mainland. That means they are on track to have the ability to strike the U.S. with a nuclear-armed missile much sooner than expected. The sanctions legislation passed by the Congress last week was a good first step toward increasing economic pressure on Pyongyang, but it left some big gaps that still need to be filled. Specifically, we need to take bolder steps to stop Chinese banks and other foreign financial institutions from doing business with North Korea. That is why Senator Pat Toomey and I have introduced bipartisan legislation entitled the Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea Act (BRINK).

So it's time for President Trump to follow that example and stop taking steps to sabotage and destabilize the Health Care Exchanges. First, Trump should stop threatening to withhold the ongoing ""cost sharing payments"" that help lower the costs of health insurance. His threats have caused huge uncertainties that will lead to insurers leaving the marketplace or dramatically increasing premiums. Second, he needs to enforce the individual mandate/shared responsibility provisions of the ACA. The whole concept of insurance is that everybody needs to be part of the insurance pool in order to share risks across a large population. Otherwise, some people will freeload on the system and not pay their fair share. Third, he needs to instruct the Department of Health and Human Services to inform consumers about the health insurance options on the Health Care Exchanges so more people sign up.   Congress should also take bipartisan measures to improve the exchanges. I am sponsoring a number of practical proposals that have been proposed by U.S. Senate Democrats and look forward to input from our Republican colleagues on these and other bills.  Once we have resolved the immediate challenges of strengthening the exchanges, we should get to work on bolder measures to reduce the rising costs of prescription drugs and ensure quality, affordable care for all.

I’ve worked on a number of budgets throughout my career—serving as the ranking member of the House Committee on the Budget and now as a member of both the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committees. During that time, I have seen lots of the gimmicks that folks have used to support their budget numbers. I thought I had seen every trick in the book, but I’ve never seen anything that approaches blatant budget fraud like the Trump Budget.   The Trump Administration’s budget schemes would make the Enron accountants blush. But don’t just take it from me: The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scored the Trump budget and said it did not come close to balancing in ten years. While the Trump Administration claims a sizable budget surplus, the CBO concludes we would have a $720 billion deficit.

But Trump’s speech in Long Island last week—encouraging law enforcement officers to not be “too nice,” and describing how officers should rough up arrestees by banging their heads against police car roofs—mattered because his words openly encouraged bad actors to violate the principles of constitutional policing and norms of appropriate behavior.   Attorney General Sessions should follow the lead of the Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),  Chuck Rosenberg, who urged his staff to disregard the President’s comments stating, “I write to offer a strong reaffirmation of the operating principles to which we, as law enforcement professionals, adhere. I write because we have an obligation to speak out when something is wrong. That’s what law enforcement officers do. … Our Core Values are clear and applicable: Rule of Law, respect, compassion, service, devotion, integrity, accountability, leadership, courage, and diversity. This is how we conduct ourselves. This is how we treat those whom we encounter in our work: victims, witnesses, subjects, and defendants. This is who we are.”   It is deeply disturbing for the President to call upon law enforcement to violate their constitutional duty and the public trust.

It's a gross abuse of power for purely political purposes and the Maryland congressional delegation will do everything in our power to reverse it.   The Justice Department’s mission is to ensure public safety and control crime—so it’s unconscionable that Sessions would threaten to withhold critical law enforcement support that could help reduce violent crime in Baltimore and other cities. Immigration enforcement is a matter for the federal government—and the Trump Administration has no right to try to commandeer the resources of the Baltimore City Police for strictly federal purposes. But there are two other reasons that make Sessions' demand especially outrageous in the case of Baltimore City. First, the Maryland Attorney General has warned Baltimore and other Maryland jurisdictions that they could be found liable for violating constitutional protections if they enforce the order from the Trump Administration to detain persons suspected of immigration violations for more than 48 hours. Second, it appears that Sessions overlooked the important fact that the Baltimore City jail is run by the State Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, not the Baltimore City Police Department. Therefore, Sessions is demanding that Baltimore Police Chief Kevin Davis and the Baltimore City Police take actions that are outside their control.  Rather than threatening Baltimore and other cities, the Justice Department should be doing what it can to support efforts to reduce violent crime.

This comes just a few weeks after North Korea tested an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), which experts believe could reach the U.S. mainland.   These developments demand a strong response and the latest round of additional United Nations (U.N.) sanctions on North Korea are an important step in building international pressure on the country. However, U.N. sanctions resolutions are only words on a piece of paper if they are not actually enforced. In fact, there are already broad U.N. sanctions in place against North Korea, but they have been ignored by financial institutions and businesses in many countries, especially in China. The failure of China and some other countries to enforce U.N. sanctions has reduced the economic pressure needed to get North Korean to engage in meaningful negotiations to end their nuclear programs.  That's why Senator Pat Toomey and I introduced bipartisan legislation—modeled after the successful Iran sanctions laws—to give real teeth to the U.N. sanctions regime. Our bill, the BRINK Act, offers foreign firms a stark choice: You can do business with the United States or with North Korea, but you can’t to do business with both. It is time to let Chinese and other firms know that if they continue to flout U.N. sanctions on North Korea, they will forfeit their access to the U.S. market.    The stakes are far too high for President Trump’s dangerous and irresponsible threats of war. Right now the real danger is the uncertainty created by Trump’s words, which are undermining our country’s credibility. Engaging in a war of words with Kim Jong Un plays into his hands.

Even more startling, anti-Muslim hate groups have almost tripled since last year. This hate movement—which has been growing rapidly—is one that fosters anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, anti-multiculturalism, and racist rhetoric. This is a white supremacist movement and one that President Trump has not only refused to denounce—but has also refused to take action against. In fact, he has engaged in a narrative of false moral equivalence between those perpetuating hate and those confronting it.   Back in April, my Democratic colleagues and I wrote to the President asking him to create a Presidential Task Force to prevent and combat hate crimes. He didn’t respond. It was only until after the horrific events in Charlottesville that Trump decided to create a subcommittee, part of the Department of Justice’s Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety that will “develop a plan to appropriately address hate crimes.” While this is a positive development, it’s simply not enough to create a small subcommittee and provide no details on how it will actually address hate crimes.

This is particularly harsh considering that Kushner Companies receives federal rental subsidies and financing from Freddie Mac so that they can serve low-income renters.

The White House has refused to release any real details on their proposal, but the little information they have shared leaves me concerned that this is just more repackaged Trickle Down Economics. Based on the outline of their plan, if your last name is Trump, this plan is great for your bottom line. But if you’re one of the millions of people who have been left behind by this economy, the President’s proposal only makes your problems worse. His plan provides a huge giveaway to himself—and leaves working Americans and future generations to pay the bill. Instead of offering more tax breaks to wealthy, powerful special interests, we must level the playing field for hardworking Americans and build an economy that helps everyone get ahead.  I’ve joined my Democratic colleagues in laying out clear principles for tax reform that actually helps working Americans. First, no tax plan should increase the tax burden on the middle class and there should be absolutely no tax cut for the top 1% wealthiest households. Second, tax reform should go through the normal legislative process so both Democrats and Republicans have an opportunity to craft a bipartisan package. If we’ve learned anything from the Republicans’ health care debacle, it’s that crafting legislation in a secret, hyper-partisan fashion is a recipe for disaster. Third, tax reform shouldn’t add to the federal deficit—and the analysis of the deficit impact must come from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), not fraudulent, Enron-style accounting that hides a huge cost to working families.  Democrats stand ready to work with the Trump Administration and Republicans if they are ready to put working Americans before wealthy special interests. Unfortunately, Trump's speech appeared to be a tax play that lifts the yachts but sinks the rest of the boats.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/trump-missouri-tax-plan.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur","nytimes.com",154,132,43,4,4,2,21,51

Tubman is fully deserving of this honor, but today Secretary Mnuchin refused to commit to moving this important project forward. This is shameful.   Born in Dorchester County, Maryland as a slave, Tubman escaped to freedom and returned to rescue others as part of the Undergound Railroad.

In 2001, when Steven was just 8 years old, his family came to the United States after his mother began receiving death threats. For nearly 16 years since arriving from Colombia, Jorge and his family have lived and worked in this country as productive, law-abiding citizens. But in 2012, having been denied the political asylum they sought in America, they were yanked from their Germantown home and locked up in a detention center on Maryland’s Eastern Shore.   The Acuña family reached out to my Congressional office and we joined forces with advocacy organizations, immigration lawyers, and local leaders to make sure they stayed where they belonged—right here in Maryland. And thanks to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Steven just graduated with a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from the University of Maryland and aspires to be an orthopedic surgeon.   The Trump Administration’s decision to rescind the DACA program is taking our country backwards. Over its five-year history, DACA has helped nearly 800,000 young people pursue higher education and grow our economy. Ending this program will cost our economy over $460.3 billion over ten years and displace over 685,000 workers vital to businesses in Maryland and across the nation.   It's important to go after gangs like MS-13, but it is an insult to decency and common sense for Dreamers, like Steven, to be targeted for deportation. At its core, America exists because people seeking freedom worked hard to build a better life. Dreamers today deserve that same chance. They came out of the shadows because of their desire to get an education and contribute to our country, and in turn, our government promised to protect them. It would go against the nation’s founding ideals to break that promise.

The latest incarnation of Trumpcare is masquerading as the Graham-Cassidy bill. Despite all their talk about finding a bipartisan approach, Senate Republicans are preparing to, once again, engage in cynical partisan politics at the expense of Americans’ right to affordable health care.  The new sneak attack on the ACA is, in many ways, even worse than the last one. Like the old versions of their bill, the new model will spike premiums and other costs, give a blank check to those who want to eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and will rob tens of millions of Americans of access to affordable care. And it will do even more damage to Medicaid than earlier versions.   I am proud of all of the Marylanders who have spoken out, tweeted, shared their stories, made calls, written letters, and marched to demand the basic right to health care. I know this fight is hard and often feels like it will never end, but know that all of our voices have made a difference before and we can do it again.   So here’s the plan: The Senate parliamentarian ruled that, under the Senate Rules, September 30th is the last day that Republicans can jam through a repeal bill using the 51 vote threshold. Which means we need to do everything in our power to make sure Republicans can’t ram through their new Trumpcare bill before the end of this month. It’s up to all of us to speak out and fight back before then.

Kimmel pointed out that his son Billy, who was born with a pre-existing condition, wouldn’t have been able to get insurance if he was born into another family who couldn’t afford it or if the Affordable Care Act hadn’t passed. Soon after, Senator Cassidy coined the term, “The Jimmy Kimmel Test,"" which, in a nutshell, means: no family should be denied medical care, emergency or otherwise, because they can’t afford it. Cassidy promised that he wouldn’t support a bill that doesn’t pass the Jimmy Kimmel Test and has claimed that the latest version of Trumpcare—which he introduced together with Senator Lindsey Graham—meets the test.   Last night on his show, Kimmel told the country that Cassidy's claim was totally false. Kimmel made it clear that the new bill violated the Jimmy Kimmel Test and demanded that supporters of the unconscionable bill in the Senate stop using his name. Whether you're a Republican, Democrat or Independent, we should all agree that no parent should ever have to decide if they can afford to save their child’s life.

On two separate occasions, Erdogan’s bodyguards beat up peaceful American protesters on our very own soil. So, like so many others, I shuddered when President Trump heaped unadulterated praise on Erdogan at the United Nations today. It’s a reversal from the limited progress we made earlier this week when the Trump Administration finally withdrew a planned sale of $1.2 million in semiautomatic handguns to the same Turkish security forces that attacked Americans in our own country.   That long overdue decision came only after Senator Patrick Leahy and I introduced an amendment to ban weapons sales to the Turkish Presidential Protection Directorate—which passed with bipartisan support in the Senate Appropriations Committee. I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to hold Erdogan and his security forces accountable for their unrelenting crackdown on dissent—including the free press, independent judiciary, and freedom of expression.

In fact, a few months ago Mitch McConnell announced that any tax overhaul plan would “have to be revenue-neutral” due to the nation’s “alarming” $20 trillion federal deficit. But now we are learning this was more hot air. Just this week, Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee said they would support a budget plan that adds a whopping $1.5 trillion dollars to the national debt—all so they can give yet another windfall tax cut to the very wealthy and special interests. Once again, we have learned that they only feign concern about the debt as an excuse for cutting Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, or vital investments in areas like education. They are perfectly happy to add to the debt by giving big tax cuts to the wealthy and powerful special interests—leaving the rest of the country to pick up the tab.   It’s the height of hypocrisy for Republicans in Congress to be preaching about debt reduction while hammering out a secret, partisan plan to give tax cuts to the rich without paying for it. And it adds insult to injury that next week they plan to add to the deficit for tax cuts while they are also planning to vote on an unconscionable Trumpcare bill—also known as Graham-Cassidy—that will eliminate access to affordable health care for millions of Americans.This two-pronged Republican plan—borrowing money to give tax cuts to the rich combined with deep cuts to affordable health care—exposes their true priorities.

The good news is that Senator Collins just announced that she is not falling for that ploy. At the same time, there are reports that Senator Paul is back at the negotiating table and is laying out his “demands.” It’s shameful that Republicans have blown up the bipartisan discussions we had in place—just so they can work behind closed door to create one of the worst “health care” bills this country has ever seen! In fact, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has just reported that the bill would result in millions of Americans losing access to affordable care and that the entire Medicaid program falls off a big cliff down the road.

While there have always been deep policy differences between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill, never in my lifetime have I witnessed the intense political polarization around the country that we are experiencing today. There are a number of reasons for the change, but one stands out—the leadership at the top. Whatever their ideology, past presidents from both parties have usually tried to unify the country. By contrast, we now have a president who engages in cynical, systematic and calculated efforts to divide the country in order to shore up his political base. That’s reflected in everything from calling for a Muslim ban during the campaign, to his wishy-washy response to white supremacists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, to his war of words against the NFL. Instead of working to bring us together, President Trump has exploited and intensified divisions in our country. We have also seen a Trumpcare proposal that would have stripped away affordable care from millions of Americans and we are now facing a tax plan that will harm the middle class and balloon the national debt to give tax cuts to the wealthy.

Marshall was born and raised in Baltimore, where his father would often listen to legal cases at the local courthouse and return home to rehash the lawyers' arguments with his two sons. Marshall credited these formative years as the foundation for his interest in civil rights and the law.  After graduating from college, Marshall applied to the University of Maryland Law School—but, despite being qualified academically, was rejected because of the color of his skin. But Marshall wasn’t deterred in his fight for equal justice under the law and later attended Howard University Law School. In 1934, soon after graduating Howard, he worked in the legal division of the NAACP. He filed dozens of lawsuits and argued dozens of cases in the effort to overturn segregation. Two years later, Marshall took on the role of the NAACP’s chief counsel. In that role, he ultimately succeeded in bringing the Brown v. Board of Education case before the Supreme Court and securing a monumental ruling against segregation in public schools.  In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Marshall to be the United States Solicitor General. Working for the Department of Justice, he won 14 out of the 19 cases that he argued before the Supreme Court. And in 1967, President Johnson nominated Marshall to be a Supreme Court Justice. As Johnson put it, “Marshall symbolizes what is best about our American society: the belief that human rights must be satisfied through the orderly processes of law.” During his 24 years on the Court, Marshall consistently challenged discrimination based on race or sex, opposed the death penalty, supported the rights of criminal defendants, defended affirmative action, and championed women’s rights.  Marshall embodied a commitment to equal justice under the law—something that’s more important than ever. Let’s honor his work by staying true to his words: “America must get to work. In the chilled climate in which we live, we must go against the prevailing winds. We must dissent from the indifference. We must dissent from the apathy. We must dissent from the fear, the hatred, and the mistrust. We must dissent from a nation that buried its head in the sand waiting in vain for the needs of its poor, its elderly, and its sick to disappear and just blow away. We must dissent from a government that has left its young without jobs, education, or hope. We must dissent from the poverty of vision and timeless absence of moral leadership. We must dissent, because America can do better, because America has no choice but to do better.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/chrisvanhollen/photos/a.10150684106803878.409441.109304033877/10155232414918878/?type=3",NA,426,24,108,80,0,2,0,0

During the debate, Senate Republicans were quick to pay lip service to helping working families—but their budget and tax plan does the opposite. In fact, Senate Republicans voted AGAINST an amendment offered by me and Kamala Harris to ensure that the GOP plan will not increase taxes on the middle class.   The GOP budget takes a sledgehammer to Medicare, Medicaid, and education funding in order to finance windfall tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. Trust me—it can be hard to follow all the moving parts in their proposal. That’s why, over the coming weeks, I’ll be reporting on different components of the GOP budget.   Today’s topic: how the Republican budget will eliminate the estate tax, the estate tax—something that only impacts two-tenths of 1%  percent of taxpayer estates—is a longstanding feature of our tax code.

The estate tax impacts only about 5,000 taxpayers a year—in the entire country. The wealthiest of the wealthy.   Teddy Roosevelt would be rolling in his grave at the Republican effort to completely eliminate the estate tax. It is designed to ensure that America does not become a place dominated by aristocratic family dynasties that accumulate ever larger shares of our national wealth. And that's why I often call it a ""dynasty tax."" We already have seen wealth inequality grow at an alarming scale. Today, the top 0.1% of households have almost as much wealth as 90 percent of the rest of the country put together. Eliminating the dynasty tax will simply accelerate this inequality.   Who benefits from eliminating the dynasty tax? People like President Trump. In fact, according to Bloomberg, it would save the President’s estate between $564 million and $2 billion. Providing this tax windfall to people like Trump will add $240 billion to our national debt over the next 10 years. That cost will be added to our national credit card to be paid by our children and grandchildren.   I proposed an amendment to block any budget that would repeal the dynasty tax, but every single one of my Republican colleagues on the Budget Committee voted against it even as they voted for a budget that would cut $1 trillion from Medicaid and almost $500 billion from Medicare.   The debate over the budget may not be the most exciting topic—but it's amongst the most consequential. The GOP budget is harmful to our future. We must fight it with all of the energy we’ve got. Are you with me Maryland?","video","https://www.facebook.com/chrisvanhollen/videos/10155239320173878/",NA,542,263,355,16,5,14,57,296

Nationally, 23 million rural Americans do not have internet service available to them at adequate speed, quality, and price. Economic opportunities are often limited in areas without broadband, which is why the government and private sector need to work together to address this issue. I’m working with my colleagues in support of a $40 billion federal investment to build the kind of broadband infrastructure that will finally connect rural communities.   However, it’s also critical that broadband service providers deliver fair and equal access to all users regardless of zip code. You see, many rural areas do not have access to fixed broadband, which is delivered through a landline or cable. It’s more expensive for telecommunication companies to install—and instead of making the necessary investments to help grow our rural economies, they have asked the FCC to change the rules so they can claim they have met their responsibilities by providing wireless coverage to rural areas. The problem is that wireless broadband is generally slower, less reliable, and more expensive for consumers than fixed broadband.  I raised this issue recently at an Agriculture Committee Hearing on rural economic development. I asked the Trump Administration to join me in asking the FCC not to change the rule in a way that shortchanges rural areas. So far, they have not responded.","video","https://www.facebook.com/chrisvanhollen/videos/10155246359203878/",NA,481,123,82,43,5,1,1,4

Then, as if the North Korean crisis is not enough, Trump appears ready to reject the advice of Secretary of Defense Mattis and manufacture a nuclear crisis with Iran. According to reports, this week Trump will take a reckless step that could inevitably lead to the unraveling of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran that was also signed by Britain, France, Germany, the European Union, China, and Russia. That dangerous act would harm our national security interests and lead us closer to war.   The Iran deal is working. It has verifiably shut off Iran’s pathways to a nuclear bomb, imposed tough constraints on Iran’s nuclear program, and subjected Iran to the most comprehensive inspection and monitoring regime ever negotiated. We also know that Iran is in compliance with the agreement. Indeed, the Trump Administration has twice certified Iran’s compliance with the deal and waived nuclear-related sanctions on Iran just a few weeks ago. Our State Department, our Defense Department, and our Intelligence Community have all assessed that Iran is in compliance with the nuclear agreement. Just today the respected head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed again that Iran is meeting its obligations. And guess what: Trump has presented NO evidence to Congress—as he is required to do by law—of any potential Iranian breach of the deal.   Make no mistake: Trump’s reasons for not certifying Iran’s compliance are based on political petulance, not national security. He wants to rip up an agreement that has prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, simply because it was negotiated by President Obama. And Trump has threatened to do this without offering any alternative plan to block Iran from getting a nuclear bomb.   There is no doubt that Iran has been a menace in the region. It supports the murderous regime of Assad in Syria, supplies terrorist groups like Hezbollah with weaponry and conducts ballistic missile tests. The United States has and must continue to confront this Iranian aggression. That said, no one was under the illusion that the Iran nuclear agreement would stop Iran from engaging in this conduct. The agreement was premised on the reality that a nuclear-armed Iran would be more of a menace on all these fronts than a non-nuclear Iran. That remains as true today as when the nuclear agreement was signed.    The choice we face right now is between sticking with an agreement that has cut off Iran’s pathways to a bomb or allowing Iran to push forward with a nuclear weapons program. It’s between maintaining U.S. credibility and leadership in the world or empowering our adversaries. It’s between diplomacy or increasing the risk of war. And If Trump kills this deal, it will make it nearly impossible to negotiate a resolution to other critical issues, like the North Korean nuclear crisis. Who will ever enter into an agreement with a country that walks away from its commitments?    I’m urging you to speak out today, contact your friend and families—remind them of what’s at stake. We face enough crises that are not of our own making; we should not pick unnecessary fights that put the security of America and our allies at risk.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/opinion/iran-deal-trump-mistake.html","nytimes.com",236,190,104,5,6,7,36,144

But now that he failed through the democratic process, he is abusing his executive authority to sabotage access to affordable care. Specifically, Trump's order today, if implemented, will weaken the ACA's health care exchanges. It will allow insurance products with skimpy coverage and few consumer protections into the market—a backdoor way to undermine access to affordable coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. This action is overwhelmingly opposed by State Insurance Commissioners because they know this will lead to a death spiral in the insurance markets, where everyone from kids with disabilities to older Americans will experience huge price spikes that makes coverage totally unaffordable. Instead of supporting the recent bipartisan efforts in Congress to improve our health care system, Trump has made it very clear that the only thing he cares about is sabotaging and destabilizing the health care market as part of his political grudge against the accomplishments of President Obama.   I am proud of all of the Marylanders who have spoken out, made calls, written letters, and marched to demand the basic right to health care.

As science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education becomes increasingly important to preparing Maryland’s students for the jobs of today, we must also strengthen and expand our strategies for teaching these critical skills. I’m proud that many of Maryland’s schools—including Easton High School and Easton Middle School—are leaders in providing innovative programs to improve their STEM courses and give more students the opportunity to succeed in high-tech careers.   I was also very impressed with the career track programs offered at Talbot County Public Schools. We have to make sure that kids who are graduating from high school have a bright future that works for them—whether that means attending four year colleges, community colleges or immediately entering the workforce—which is why I’ve always supported the federal Perkins Career and Technical Education Program to give schools the resources they need.   During the tour, I had the opportunity to see many of their programs firsthand—including the biomedical science, computer science, auto tech, and culinary arts classrooms at Easton High School. And at Easton Middle School, I had the opportunity to tour a PLTW - Project Lead The Way class, which is a national program that empowers students to explore subjects like coding and robotics, flight and space, and DNA and crime scene analysis.   Thank you to Superintendent Kelly Griffith and Assistant Superintendent for Instruction Helga Einhorn for inviting me to learn more about the creative programs being offered at Talbot County Public Schools!

First, it’s important for Marylanders to understand that the Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land—despite efforts by President Trump to sabotage it. In fact, Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray just announced that they have reached a bipartisan agreement to strengthen the law and reverse the Trump Administration’s sabotage attempts. I strongly support this agreement and hope it will gain sufficient Republican support in the Senate and House to pass, and that we will send it to the President for his signature.

Trump used a bureaucratic sleight of hand to bypass Senate confirmation and hire Noreika as a ""special government employee.""

Make no mistake—it’s is a massive giveaway to big corporations and the very wealthy, financed by socking it to working people in Maryland. If you’re a family whose estate is worth more than $11 million, a special interest group with a powerful lobbyist, or Trump and his uber-rich friends, you’re seeing a huge windfall. But how is it paid for?  By hitting Americans who struggle with high medical bills or care for an aging parent and double taxing hardworking Americans by repealing the state and local income tax deduction. Yet all of that isn’t even enough to pay for this plan. After years of raising alarm about the national debt, the GOP plan would add $1.5 trillion to the debt—leaving future generations on the hook and endangering Americans’ retirement security. Republicans refuse to recognize the fact that ‘trickle down economics’ has already failed—here they are, proposing to lift yachts at the expense of everyone and everything else. I stand ready to work with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to simplify our tax code, put working families first, and create jobs. Unfortunately, the Republicans’ tax plan does the opposite.  I’m headed to the Senate floor to speak about next steps in our fight to defeat this plan.

This past week the Senate passed, and the President signed, the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission Act. This new measure will establish a commission to honor and celebrate the life and work of Frederick Douglass as we mark the 200th anniversary of his birth next year. Most importantly, the Commission determine how the work of Frederick Douglass can guide us on our continuing journey to build a more perfect union.  I was honored to introduce this resolution in the Senate together with my colleague Senator Ben Cardin And thank you to Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton and Andy Harris for introducing and passing the bill in the House. Thanks also to the Douglass family for helping make this Commission a reality.   Frederick Douglass was an American hero and a great Marylander. Enslaved at birth in Talbot County, he grew to become a national leader in the fight to end slavery and win the right to vote for women. In his twenties, Douglass escaped slavery and eventually fled to England. In 1846 British Quakers raised funds to pay for his freedom and he returned home to the United States. He became one of the greatest orators, writers and social reformers in American history. His autobiography, ""Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave,"" was a bestseller during his lifetime and Douglass played a central role in the abolitionist movement and became a world-renowned leader in the fight to end the evil institution of slavery.   I look forward to working with the Commission to develop a plan for our nation to celebrate and learn from the powerful example of Frederick Douglass.","link","http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/blog/bs-md-trump-douglass-20171102-story.html","baltimoresun.com",681,103,111,73,15,7,0,3

Unfortunately, the President's overheated rhetoric has raised the risk of war and reduced the chances for a peaceful solution.  We should take a different approach. A war of words will not denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, but putting real teeth into United Nations sanctions can ratchet up the economic pressure and bring Kim Jung Un to the negotiating table. That's why Senator Toomey and I introduced the bipartisan Otto Warmbier Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea bill, called the BRINK Act.  I am pleased to report that today the Senate Banking Committee voted to pass the bill.  The BRINK Act imposes mandatory sanctions on the foreign banks and companies that facilitate illicit financial transactions for North Korea. It sends an unmistakable message: if you do business with North Korea you will lose access to the U.S. market.  Tonight President Trump will arrive in China. Ninety percent of North Korean trade is with China and Chinese firms have been notorious for violating UN sanctions. I don't know what President Trump will say to President Xi Jingping, but the legislation we passed today is more powerful than any words—it lets China know we are serious about penalizing any Chinese banks that help the North Korean regime.  President Theodore Roosevelt wisely advised us to ""speak softly and carry a big stick."" Trump should heed this advice by dialing down the rhetoric and using the BRINK Act to increase economic pressure on North Korea to negotiate a peaceful solution.

It's also an economic lifeline for much of Maryland's economy. The health our economy—the tourism, boating, and seafood industries—depend on a healthy Bay.    In Maryland, we’ve successfully worked closely with our farmers to make sure we have both a vibrant farming industry on the Eastern Shore and a healthy Bay. Back in 1990, when I was in the Maryland General Assembly, we fought Big Oil together—banning drilling in key parts of the watershed. In 2008, I worked with our farmers and the environmental community to launch the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Initiative—a partnership with farmers to implement agricultural practices to reduce the flow of excessive levels of nutrients and sediments into the Bay.    But our work is far from over.   That’s why today I introduced the bipartisan Chesapeake Bay Farm Bill Enhancements Act. This legislation will triple funding for the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) in the farm program—from $100 million to $300 million—and target those resources to better protect the most environmentally fragile areas in vital watersheds across the nation. Those improvements will strengthen the efforts of farmers to build things like manure storage and stream buffers that prevent harmful nutrients from being discharged into sensitive watersheds. I’m pleased to report that this bill is supported by a bipartisan group of senators, representatives, and governors from the Bay Watershed, as well as over 70 environmental organizations—including the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Choose Clean Water.

Over 800,000 Dreamers came out of the shadows because of their desire to get an education and contribute to our country—and in turn, our government promised to protect them. They were raised pledging allegiance to the American flag, and their passion and civic engagement embodies the American spirit. Deporting these Dreamers would be an inhumane betrayal of our commitments and disrupt communities and economies throughout the nation.  As we work to protect Dreamers, we should also work to support another group of individuals who have not received as much attention but are just as vulnerable—TPS recipients. For decades, the United States has granted protected status to immigrants who were legally in the United States at the time their country of origin was devastated by catastrophic natural disasters, disease or civil war and violence. In Maryland, we have nearly 30,000 TPS recipients, many of whom have been living here legally for over two decades.

Parks was a woman who dedicated her life to changing our Nation so that all Americans would have the opportunity to experience true freedom and justice. It was her courage and steadfast resolve that launched the Montgomery bus boycott and helped spark the civil rights movement. Since then, she has inspired generations of civil rights activists and changed the course of our Nation’s history forever.   As we honor her legacy, we must recommit ourselves to stamping out injustice wherever it exists. The best way we can pay tribute to this remarkable woman is by speaking out boldly against inequality and oppression and refusing to accept, ignore, or submit to it.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/chrisvanhollen/photos/a.10150684106803878.409441.109304033877/10155372769448878/?type=3",NA,542,69,91,101,0,0,0,1

I vividly remember the awful days of the slaughters in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs. On those days, like so many times before, I begged my colleagues to put politics aside and do something meaningful to limit gun violence. But instead, they have ignored the pleas of the overwhelming majority of Americans and decided that the political support from the NRA is more important than making Americans safer. Any of my colleagues who stifle legislation to reduce gun violence are not honoring the victims—they are guaranteeing more victims. Thoughts and prayers are important when bringing communities together in the aftermath of tragedies, but they are not the answer to the systematic bloodshed our country is experiencing.

But what Republicans are voting on today is not reform—it’s highway robbery for the middle class.

This bill adds over $1 trillion to our national debt. Congressional Republicans, who have spent years lecturing about the dangers of debt, are now apparently happy to finance tax cuts for the rich by putting them on the national credit card to be paid for by our children and grandchildren.

I just got back from witnessing one of the biggest legislative heists in American history. For days, Republicans were huddled behind closed doors, surrounded by lobbyists for the rich and powerful. And now, under the cover of darkness, Senate Republicans voted to ram this tax scam through the Senate. Do you know why they don't want to wait to read the bill? Because the more the public sees their plan, the more they hate it. The faster they rush it, the easier it is for them to score a political win with their donors—which a Republican Congressman conceded was the goal of their bill.  And despite what Republicans have promised, this legislation will not spur economic growth—it will cause our national debt to explode and slow economic growth as time goes on. The claim that workers will get a $4,000 pay raise will soon be shown for the farce that it is. Meanwhile, millions of middle-class families will pay more. And for those middle-class families who do get tax cuts, they will be puny compared to the $70,000 a year average tax cut for millionaires. Moreover, the tax cuts for families will be temporary while the giant tax cuts for corporations are forever. Don’t just take it from me, the facts have been clearly laid out by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation: This bill increases the debt by more than $1 trillion and the biggest beneficiaries are millionaires and big corporations. And when this bill is fully phased in, the small tax cuts for families expire while the big tax cuts for corporations are forever. In fact, ten years from now American families who make less than $75,000 will be paying higher taxes, on average, in order to pay for a permanent tax cut for multinational corporations—including a huge tax cut for foreign stockholders.  It’s shameful that the greatest deliberative body in the world just prioritized a windfall giveaway to multinational corporations and billionaires while real priorities like CHIP, community health centers, disaster relief, the Dream Act, TPS, pension security, and funding our government remain unresolved.","video","https://www.facebook.com/chrisvanhollen/videos/10155419165708878/",NA,2114,1327,4772,49,109,47,479,1627
