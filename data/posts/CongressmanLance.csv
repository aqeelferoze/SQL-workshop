Chiarelli, Clark, Hayden, Hill, McChrystal and Petraeus in opposition to the bill that could put veterans' safety at risk.  Shortly after the tragedy at Virginia Tech, Congress passed, and President Bush signed into law, bipartisan legislation in 2008 requiring the Department of Veterans Affairs to send the names of veterans who have clear and convincing evidence of mental incompetency to the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System. Any person listed within this system is ineligible to legally purchase firearms from a licensed dealer.  The legislation Congress debated and passed Thursday would reverse this law and immediately remove more than 174,000 mental health records from the background check system. The records that would be removed include veterans who are prohibited from obtaining guns because they are suffering from serious mental illnesses like dementia, schizophrenia, and long-term severe posttraumatic stress.  In their letter the Veterans Coalition for Common Sense wrote,  ""The bill you are debating comes at a time when an average of 20 veterans commit suicide each day, two-thirds of whom do so by using a firearm. We know that non-deployed veterans are at a 61 percent higher risk of suicide compared to the American civilian population, and deployed veterans are at a 41 percent higher risk,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúWhen vulnerable veterans have access to firearms, they can do harm not only to themselves but also to family members and loved ones. The impact of these tragedies is felt in communities across our nation.  This proposal would put America‚Äôs veterans who need our support the most in harm‚Äôs way by providing them with easy access to firearms.""  Congress had already addressed the issue of due process as part of the 21st Century Cures Law Act and believe further action would severely undercut those bipartisan efforts undertaken and signed into law both last year and in 2008. -- L.L.","link","http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/03/what_happened_after_the_nra_spent_23m_to_elect_a_r.html","nj.com",304,90,17,16,0,0,0,4
