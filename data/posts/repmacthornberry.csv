First on the agenda will be regulations.  The last years of the Obama Administration saw a blizzard of regulations that killed jobs and added burdens to every sized business.  Congress will act to repeal or correct some of the most burdensome regulations, and we will push legislation that requires all major regulations, defined as having more than a $100 million effect on the economy, to be approved by Congress before they can be implemented.   Second is Obamacare.  Portions of Obamacare can be repealed with a majority vote in the Senate rather than the 60 votes often required.  House Republicans issued specific health care reform proposals last spring as part of our “A Better Way” plan.  These proposals will serve as the starting point for the new approach to health care.  Working with the new Administration, which has a lot of discretion on the details of Obamacare, we will repeal the failing scheme and transition to a commonsense health care plan that will serve patients, providers, and the country as a whole much better.

All Americans should be able to work hard, build, and save knowing that they can pass on what they have earned to their children and grandchildren.","video","https://youtu.be/r5DS_4mSTYs",NA,1033,108,209,89,0,0,1,2

Our bills will help provide these property owners the certainty that they deserve to know where public lands end and private lands begin.  The legislation will provide legal certainty to property owners along the Red River by:  • Commissioning a survey of the majority of the 116-mile stretch of contested area along the Red River using the gradient boundary survey method developed and backed by the Supreme Court to find the proper ownership boundary between public and private land.    • Ordering that the survey be conducted by licensed and qualified surveyors chosen by Texas and Oklahoma.  • Providing states the authority to oversee the surveyors and approve the final survey to ensure the Supreme Court instructions are properly followed.  • Requiring that a notice of survey approval, a copy of the survey, and any related field notes be provided to each individual land owner after the survey is completed.  • Ensuring that nothing in the bill alters the Red River Boundary Compact, modifies the interests of the states, or harms the rights of the impacted federally recognized Indian Tribes.","video","https://youtu.be/Ux_6kZkQSCU",NA,79,9,9,4,0,0,0,0

Last night, I voted for and the House passed a bill, H.R. 423, that would expand the Federal Communications Commission’s authority to enforce criminal penalties and fine individuals that use fake information about a caller’s identification to defraud or harm another person.   In one of the most recent widespread scams, criminals call or send emails to the victims and identify themselves as Department of the Treasury or Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officials. They claim that the victim owes money to the IRS and that they must pay the balance immediately using a credit card, pre-paid debit card, or wire transfer. They threaten punishment, including arrest or suspension of a business or driver’s license if the debt is not paid immediately. The scammers may also use fake badge numbers and use phone numbers with a 202 Washington area code.   If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS or the Treasury Department, and uses the threat of legal action if you do not pay immediately, that is a sign that it is not the IRS calling and your cue to hang up. If you believe you have been a target of this type of scam, report it to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration at https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/contact_report_scam.shtml or 1-800-366-4484.   Reporting these incidents helps in the following ways according to the Department of the Treasury:    • Providing the call-back number can lead to arrests. • It builds an evidentiary trail. • Telephone numbers are shut down. • Scam attempts are cataloged.","link","https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/contact_report_scam.shtml","treasury.gov",68,9,15,0,0,0,0,0

Since first being implemented, it has driven up insurance premiums, hurt small businesses, and lowered the quality of and access to care.  Last week, House Republicans put forth an initial proposal to repeal and replace this disastrous law. It is the first step in a process that will lead to patient-centered care that provides more choices and lowers prices instead of creating more mandates and taxes.  There are opportunities to improve the plan during the legislative process, but it is important to get started and get this job done. The procedure rules – especially in the Senate – mean that Obamacare cannot be repealed and replaced in a single bill.  The tax and spending portions of Obamacare can be repealed and replaced under a special procedure known as reconciliation that only requires 51 votes in the Senate rather than the 60 required for most bills. Other parts of the repeal and replace will need 60 votes. There are currently 52 Republican seats in the Senate. In addition, the new Administration also has the ability to change many of the regulations associated with Obamacare.

You can read more about the scam from ABC News:    “The scam begins as soon as a person answers the phone. A recorded voice or an actual person asks: ‘Can you hear me?’ And the consumer responds, ‘Yes.’”   “‘The caller then records the consumer's 'Yes' response and thus obtains a voice signature. This signature can later be used by the scammers to pretend to be the consumer and authorize fraudulent charges via telephone,’ an FCC news release said.”   “The FCC advised consumers to immediately hang up if they receive this type of call. It also said that if consumers had responded ‘Yes’ to a similar call in the past, they should keep an eye on all financial statements for any unauthorized charges.”   The FCC also shared the following tips:   1. Don't answer calls from unknown numbers. Let them go to voicemail.   2. If you answer and the caller (often a recording) asks you to hit a button to stop receiving calls, just hang up. Scammers often use these tricks to identify, and then target, live respondents.   3. If you receive a scam call, write down the number and file a complaint with the FCC so we can help identify and take appropriate action to help consumers targeted by illegal callers.   4. Ask your phone service provider if it offers a robocall blocking service. If not, encourage your provider to offer one. You can also visit the FCC's website for information and resources on available robocall blocking tools to help reduce unwanted calls. Consider registering all of your telephone numbers in the National Do Not Call Registry.   http://abcnews.go.com/Business/fcc-warns-consumers-phone-scam/story?id=46405703","link","http://abcnews.go.com/Business/fcc-warns-consumers-phone-scam/story?id=46405703","abcnews.go.com",18,16,29,0,0,1,1,10

The President’s order coincides with Congress’s ongoing effort to repeal or roll back regulations that were issued under the previous administration.

I also voted for another bill, H.R. 2192, that ensures that provisions in the AHCA apply to Members of Congress and congressional staff.  In order to pass the Senate, this bill was considered under a special procedure that directly affects spending and revenue. Additional legislation will repeal and replace other portions of Obamacare and the new Administration will change many of the regulations associated with Obamacare.  The bill that the House passed does not reduce or change in any way current Medicare benefits. The bill will increase Medicare payments to hospitals that serve a higher than average percentage of uninsured patients. However, health coverage benefits to Medicare beneficiaries are not altered.  The bill repeals the Obamacare taxes, subsidies, and mandates. This includes the individual and employer mandates, the additional 0.9 percent Medicare payroll tax on high-income earners, along with the taxes imposed on medical devices, health insurers, and prescription drugs, among others. It also places a one-year moratorium on government funding for Planned Parenthood.  I believe that Obamacare has caused enormous problems for the American health care system. It is important that it be replaced with an approach that puts more decisions in the hands of patients and their health care professionals.

It is also a day to be thankful for the freedoms that they and so many others have fought to protect. I encourage everyone to take the time to honor the brave men and women who were called to battle and in doing so lost their lives.   Traditionally, Memorial Day is observed by decorating the graves of fallen servicemembers and that is certainly appropriate. While the sacrifices they made can never truly be repaid, an even greater tribute is to live our lives in a way that honors them and their sacrifice.   It is also important that we remember the loved ones who were left behind and their sacrifice to our country. Those mothers, fathers, spouses, and children bear a burden that few of us can understand.  President Bush gave a speech to commemorate Memorial Day at the beaches of Normandy in 2002. He spoke about the families of our fallen warfighters by saying in part:  “Behind every grave of a fallen soldier is a story of the grief that came to a wife, a mother, a child, a family or a town. A World War II orphan has described her family's life after her father was killed on the field in Germany. ‘My mother,’ she said, ‘had lost everything she was waiting for. She lost her dreams.’  “Each person buried here understood his duty but also dreamed of going back home to the people and the things he knew. Each had plans and hopes of his own that parted with him forever when he died.”  Of course, our gratitude must extend beyond one day a year. Among other ways, ensuring that the government's commitments made to those who served and to their families are kept is important. And Congress keeps working to improve the care and service our veterans receive.   Sally and I are grateful for all who serve or have served, and we hope you join us in remembering and honoring those who made the ultimate sacrifice.","status",NA,NA,111,7,18,11,0,0,0,0

Under current law, there are seven tax brackets for individuals and families.  The tax reform framework creates a fairer and simpler system by reducing it into three brackets – 12%, 25%, 35%.  As we continue to look at comprehensive tax reform, there may be an additional top rate for the highest-income taxpayers.  By lowering rates and simplifying the federal tax code, hard-working Americans will keep more of the money they earn and spend less time calculating their taxes.     To see the full framework visit: www.fairandsimple.gop  As you may know, this is simply a framework for tax reform – suggestions and ideas are welcome.","link","http://www.fairandsimple.gop/","fairandsimple.gop",6,3,0,0,0,0,0,0

It should be no surprise that most of the income tax relief goes to the 56% who actually pay income taxes.    2) The median income for a family of four today is $73,000.  That family will pay $2,059 less in federal income tax under this bill according to the House and Senate tax committees.  3) 82.6% of the people who file tax returns in the 13th District of Texas do not itemize deductions and use the standard deduction.  That standard deduction increases from $6,350 for an individual to $12,000, nearly double, and is indexed for inflation in the future.  4) The average corporate tax rate in Europe is about 18%.  The 21% corporate rate in this bill is a big reduction but still higher than some of our key competitors.   5) This bill repeals the individual mandate in Obamacare starting January 1, 2019.

It is easy to become consumed with the conflicts of our country and our world, but this time of year is an opportunity to step back and remember that the burden is not just upon us.  God sent us a savior to take our future into His hands.    Isaiah 9:6 says, “For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repmacthornberry/photos/a.10151548309910628.1073741825.7760165627/10156430453285628/?type=3",NA,92,12,2,11,0,0,0,0

Mac Thornberry's office will host a service academy forum in Amarillo on Saturday, April 1, 2017 from 9:00 a.m. until 11:00 a.m. for individuals interested in attending a U.S military service academy. The event will be held at the Texas Air and Space Museum at Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport.  The forum is open to all young men and women interested in attending one of the U.S. Service Academies and their parents. Information will also be available regarding university level ROTC.  The Nomination Process:  To be considered for an appointment to a service academy, an applicant must meet the eligibility requirements established by law and be nominated from an authorized person including a Member of the United States Senate or the House of Representatives. I may nominate applicants who are legally domiciled within the boundaries of our district.  Who Is Eligible?  An applicant for a nomination must meet the following eligibility requirements as of July 1 of the year of admission to a service academy. He or she must be at least 17 years old, but not have passed the 23rd birthday, must be a United States citizen, and must be unmarried, not pregnant, and have no legal obligation to support children or other dependents.  Applying To My Office For A Nomination:  Students interested in a nomination should complete an academy appointment application in the spring of their junior year in high school. You may fax the completed application to (806) 371-7044 or mail it to my Amarillo office (905 South Fillmore Street, Suite 520, Amarillo, TX 79101). Also, please note that it is extremely important that the student begin the application process with the academies themselves.   Service Academies  There are five Service Academies: The United States Air Force (USAFA), Naval (USNA), Military (USMA), Merchant Marine (USMMA), and Coast Guard (USCGA) Academies. Nominations are required for all but the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, to which appointments are made on the basis of an annual nationwide competition.  As far as the USAFA, USNA, and USMA are concerned, there are various nomination authorities, with each eligible young person being able to apply to both United States Senators from the applicant's state, his or her United States Representative, and the Vice President (if very highly qualified). The other nomination categories are military-affiliated.  With respect to the Congressional category, each Representative and each Senator is allowed to have at each of those academies at any one time five persons charged to his or her quota. There are three methods of nominating, and I use the competitive method. For each vacancy, ten nominations may be made on a strictly competitive basis. The competitive method provides that the nominees compete among themselves for final appointment determined by the admissions authorities. They take into consideration a nominee's academic record, extracurricular and athletic activities, physical aptitude, ACT and/or SAT scores, leadership ability, and medical qualifications. Such facets of an applicant's record are also considered during the nomination selection process. No person will be offered admission if he or she does not meet the physical standards of the Academy unless awarded a medical waiver.  As competition for nomination and appointment is very keen, it is wise for all interested persons to apply through all sources for which they are eligible and for all Academies in which they have a real interest. An individual may be nominated by more than one nominating authority and/or to more than one Academy.  With regard to the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the locality boundary for nomination by a Representative is the State in which the District lies rather than just the District itself. Each Representative and each Senator may nominate ten candidates each year to compete for admission.
