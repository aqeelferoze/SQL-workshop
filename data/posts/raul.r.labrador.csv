Shauna, a junior at Eagle High School, died in 2012 as a result of an automobile accident. Capt.

Labrador","2017-10-11","2017-10-11 21:06:01","A new report from the Idaho Department of Lands - Idaho Land Board provides new evidence that active forest management reduces wildfire risk. The study of fires categorized by land ownership shows fires burned at a considerably higher rate on federal lands, which suffer from inadequate management due to environmental and process restrictions. The report covers the 2007 to 2017 fire seasons.  Federal lands make up 63 percent of the land in Idaho but accounted for 86 percent of the fires in the 11-year period. State ownership makes up 5 percent of the acreage and accounted for 4 percent of acres burned. Thirty percent of the land is in private ownership, where 8 percent of the acres were burned. Tribal ownership equals 2 percent of the land, where 2 percent of the acreage burned.  Put another way, 6.2 million acres of the 33.6 million acres of federal land burned, or 18.5 percent. Fires burned 280,000 acres of the 2.7 million state-owned acreage, or 10.3 percent. Private lands had 603,000 acres burned, of a total of 16 million acres, or 3.8 percent. Finally, 125,000 acres of the 935,000 acres of tribal lands burned, or 13.3 percent.   We can't let this pattern continue. That's why I'm an original cosponsor of the Resilient Federal Forests Act, H.R. 2936. We're fighting for a floor vote in the House, which passed a similar bill in 2015. With all the disastrous wildfires of 2017, my hope is the Senate will take up the bill this year.  It's time to restore multiple-use management of our federal lands and revive our forests and rural communities. Click below to read the Department of Lands report.
