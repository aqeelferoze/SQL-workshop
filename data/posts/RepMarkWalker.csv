The effects of Obamacare are clear: North Carolinians are anxious about their health security, their out-of-pocket costs have soared and their choices for insurers and doctors have dwindled. President Obama has consistently and falsely claimed that we don’t have a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. Today, the Republican Study Committee and Dr. Phil Roe introduced the American Health Care Reform Act of 2017, proving President Obama wrong again.  This bill repeals and replaces Obamacare, improving healthcare accessibility and affordability for the people and small businesses of North Carolina who have been crying out for relief.

In his memoir of the Montgomery bus boycott titled “Stride Toward Freedom”, Dr. King took to heart the principles of nonviolence, heralding the importance of fighting for freedom with the weapon of love. He wrote: “Along the way of life, someone must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate. This can only be done by projecting the ethic of love to the center of our lives.”  Dr. King knew that the only way to change the world was through showing compassion to others – to neighbors, to those in power, to those who disagree with you. At a time when our nation seems somewhat more divided or tense, may we all remember that it is the basic principle of love that can be a lasting, unifying power. As we remember the legacy of Dr. King, may we challenge ourselves to take his message of unconditional love to heart, using it as a powerful force for change and the betterment of our community and our nation. As Dr. King knew, Americans are all “inextricably bound” together in our quest for freedom.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepMarkWalker/photos/a.399178923575199.1073741828.398458436980581/707902072702881/?type=3",NA,39,3,0,8,0,0,0,0

The best policy in the world, if no one hears it, if no one sees it, if it never reaches our audience, than it’s worthless and it’s futile.

They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them.’ This darkness is saturated in ignorance, denying that God has created every man, woman, boy and girl uniquely with exceptional skills and talent.

The White House contacted our office on Thursday and we negotiated throughout the night adding four major amendments to this legislation. There remains items of improvement to the bill and we will continue working to lead these efforts. Here's a brief report and summary from the Daily Signal:  ""Trump said he agreed to 'certain changes' to the bill dealing with the Medicaid expansion. Specifically, the president and members of the group agreed to give states the option to implement work requirements on those enrolled in Medicaid and the option to change Medicaid to a block grant program.   They also agreed to add a provision ensuring the tax credits implemented under the plan can’t be used to pay for abortions.  'The president and the vice president have called a group of conservatives from the U.S. House of Representatives and asked us for our support to move the American Health Care Act forward,' Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker, R-N.C., told reporters after the meeting. 'We’re honored to be here to represent the conservatives and to work with the president and vice president for all communities of the American people.""

I always look forward to seeing the family and my ten-year old telling me about her week. Today, I return saddened by what has transpired - a group of moderate Republicans along with a handful of fellow conservative Republicans sided with Nancy Pelosi and every Democrat in the House to keep Obamacare.  Yes, the original draft of the American Health Care Act was not good enough for the people of North Carolina. After six weeks of working to make changes to improve the bill, we had a breakthrough.

He agreed and with those shared goals, we agreed to significant changes to improve the bill.  Sadly, we missed an opportunity to protect life, repeal Obamacare and remove the mandates that have burdened employers and patients with soaring costs. As of now, Obamacare is the law of the land for the foreseeable future.  As you may have noticed on social media, people are demanding that we only need to fix Obamacare. Really? The Affordable Care Act started with 2,500 pages and the previous administration added another 6,000 pages trying to ""fix"" Obamacare. Next year in North Carolina, 80% of the projected enrollees will have only ONE choice for their health insurance. That is unacceptable.  In the words of former President Bill Clinton, ""This model doesn't work here.""  I can truthfully say that I am at peace with my decision knowing that I have done my best to make the AHCA better and remove the seven year debacle of Obamacare. We have to bring relief to those suffering under Obamacare.   Though I am frustrated, please hear me when I say that our work is not over. Our efforts to provide lower costs, more choices, and greater control over health care for North Carolinians will continue long passed this.  Thank you for the honor to serve and I will continue to work for North Carolinians and all Americans in this great land that God has blessed.","status",NA,NA,265,167,39,5,4,2,19,15

The body which I have the privilege of currently serving, approved a declaration of war against Germany, thrusting America into World War I and setting the course for what would be a defining century for our country and the rights of a free people.  Over the last hundred years, generations of Americans have forged a strong and prosperous nation, using their God-given gifts and hard work to build great things, make unbelievable technological advances, cure life-threatening diseases and achieve the American Dream. For example, what started as the imagination of two brothers on the beaches of North Carolina, propelled us into the skies, launched us into the stars and carried a man to the moon.  For me, the story of our last century can be best encapsulated in this: Americans come together when our backs are against the wall. Think in the dark days following the attack on Pearl Harbor. In my lifetime, I think to the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. The advancement of our nation over the last century is a testament to the steadfastness of the American people.  These moments, meant to cripple us, had almost an immediate and opposite result. Coming out of those tragic moments that shook our nation to its core, we became one country. The world got a glimpse of America’s heart, with genuine warmth and compassion shared from neighbor to neighbor.  America’s best days lie ahead. As we close a period of what will be remembered as an extraordinary 100 years for America, we must turn the page, looking forward to the next chapter in our story.  We can’t let our political differences divide us, but we should allow them to make us stronger – through the exchange of perspectives and effective debate on the merits of our ideas. We must also continue to foster policies that empower people, not government. For that is where the innovation and imagination that drives our country is boundless.  Today, is a historic day. More importantly, it's a day to devote ourselves to setting course for the next great American century.","link","http://online.wsj.com/ww1/","online.wsj.com",13,1,2,0,0,0,0,0

She never retreats and is one strong woman. She has survived a couple bouts of cancer and her osteoporosis is severe, periodically breaking vertebrae causing a large curvature in her spine.  Two weeks ago, I was in Washington, in the middle of the debate on health care reform, when I received a call about my mother. She was in the ER having difficulty breathing. After four days in the hospital, she was told she would be on oxygen for the rest of her life due to pulmonary issues. The very next day she was back at the church, oxygen tank in tow, serving for several hours with the same devotion she’s given for nearly five decades.  (You can read this in full on Medium here: https://medium.com/@RepMarkWalker/mothers-day-and-health-care-reform-f36da8dad662)  This seemingly invincible woman, who never took a paycheck, has sacrificed much in serving thousands over the years. However, her growing physical vulnerabilities show the wear and tear of giving her life away to others in service. In this moment, the last thing she should have to worry about is her health and financial security.  In transparency, my parents are not wealthy people. My father and mother devoted their life to helping others. After years of giving away much of what little they earned, they face challenging decisions, along with many other North Carolinians in their senior years.  It is rare that I discuss personal matters, but hostile discourse has created a need for me to share a family perspective. For example, my younger brother has been blind for two decades. He will never see his daughters walk down the aisle or drive his boys to a ballgame.  When people make mindless accusations that the new health care legislation will dangerously impact my parents, children with disabilities or those with pre-existing conditions — it’s personal for me.  While many in our state may disagree on the way to improve health care, the tone and false charges are mind-boggling. This week, the flyer shown above was distributed on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus.  Misinformation and political motivations are attempting to mislead us on the repeal and replace of Obamacare — especially in terms of pre-existing conditions which is firmly protected in the plan by guaranteeing no one can be denied coverage and benefits.  This week, my office heard from the mother of a precious 5-year old girl, who I had the pleasure of meeting a year ago. The girl is disabled and has a terminal illness. Her mother, as any mom would be, was concerned about the health stability of the girl, who gets assistance from Medicaid for her treatments.  The mother had legitimate concerns after hearing frightening charges through the media. We both agree that our health care system needs reformed by empowering people with quality, affordable health care, while strengthening our safety net for the most vulnerable.  In the girl’s case, Medicaid was created to primarily assist with the health care needs of children, mothers, and the disabled. What transpired under Obamacare was irresponsible. With no way to pay for it, people who Medicaid was never intended to serve were forced onto the program. This did great harm to the system and is taking resources away from the most vulnerable North Carolinians. We are going to fix that. The health care vote we had last week was the first step.  In fact, the bill that passed the House does more to protect people with pre-existing conditions than Obamacare does. Take for instance in our own state, where in all but a handful of counties, there will only be one insurer offering health plans — and that one insurer is weighing a decision to leave. That is not health security for people with pre-existing conditions. Those are not the assurances our parents and loved ones need.  Here are some of the myths about the legislation that are being spread and what the truth actually is:  MYTH: It guts access to health insurance and gets rid of protections for those with pre-existing conditions.  FACT: Nothing could be farther from the truth. The bill ensures that all Americans have access to affordable health insurance and maintains current law prohibitions that prevent insurance companies from denying or limiting coverage to patients based on a pre-existing condition.  MYTH: It will allow those with pre-existing conditions to be priced out of the market, effectively rendering those protections useless.  FACT: Americans have faced skyrocketing costs for Obamacare coverage, which has already created a financial hardship for many with pre-existing conditions, in some cases pricing them out of the market. In fact, average Obamacare premiums in North Carolina increased by 40 percent in 2017.  The bill includes a continuous coverage provision to encourage Americans to maintain their health insurance coverage. Under the legislation, if an individual allows their insurance coverage to lapse for more than 63 days, then insurance companies may assess a 30 percent surcharge for one year. This will help stabilize risk pools and keep premiums down for everyone by encouraging people to purchase insurance while they are young and healthy, rather than just signing up for coverage when they get sick and need expensive care.  If a state has a risk-sharing program in place to protect people with pre-existing conditions, the bill allows the state to seek a waiver from certain federal mandates. States could use the waiver to allow insurance companies to vary premiums based on health status for individuals who failed to maintain continuous coverage, in lieu of the arbitrary 30 percent surcharge. It also includes $8 billion for states to reduce premiums and other out-of-pocket costs for individuals in waiver states who failed to maintain continuous coverage. The legislation would not allow insurance companies to consider health status when setting premiums for any individual who maintained continuous coverage.  MYTH: It does away with critical “Essential Health Benefits,” such as coverage for maternity care or mental health care.  FACT: Obamacare mandates that all health insurance plans sold on the individual market must include coverage for ten categories of “essential health benefits.” Each essential health benefit is important to some individuals, but not every essential health benefit is important to every person. For example, a 55 year-old couple with no children does not need, and cannot use, coverage for pediatric care. Mandating a one-size-fits-all federal benefit package limits choice and drives up prices for most, forcing Americans to pay for coverage of all ten essential health benefits regardless of whether they require, desire, or can even use that coverage.  The bill allows states to seek a waiver from these federal requirements in order to define the level and content of essential health benefits that insurance companies are required to cover within that state’s borders. This increased flexibility would allow for a wider variety of plans to be offered at lower prices than if the federal mandates remained in place, and give insurance companies flexibility to tailor products to meet consumers’ specific needs.   Further, increased marketplace competition resulting from an increase in the number of available plans should also reduce premiums. The legislation’s Patient and State Stability Fund also dedicates $15 billion for states to provide maternity coverage and newborn care, inpatient and outpatient care for mental illness, and early identification of mental health conditions in children.  MYTH: It would throw us back to the days where patients could be discriminated against based on their sex.  FACT: This is just wrong. The bill does not allow insurance companies to discriminate based on sex.  MYTH: Twenty-four million Americans will be kicked off their health care coverage under the plan.  FACT: This is not true. The bill would ensure every American has access to affordable, quality health care. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Congress’s official numbers cruncher and forecaster, did estimate that the plan would increase the number of uninsured people in the United States by 24 million in 2026. Projecting behavior and health insurance coverage in a competitive market is difficult, however, and CBO sometimes misses the mark.  For example, CBO’s assumption of the effects of Obamacare’s individual mandate, which compels every American to purchase Obamacare-compliant health insurance coverage or pay a penalty, is that it will yield much higher enrollment than has been the real world experience. In 2010, CBO projected that 21 million Americans would gain coverage under Obamacare by 2016. Actual enrollment was closer to ten million. The legislation would repeal the individual mandate, so that Americans would no longer be forced to buy insurance.  Obamacare left the most vulnerable North Carolinians with only one insurer and no options — that’s not compassionate, that’s leaving them helpless. It has forced families in North Carolina to decide between paying for health insurance they cannot afford to use or a tax penalty they cannot escape.  Our vote last week helps North Carolinians gain access to better health care by providing a monthly tax credit to low and middle-income families to purchase the care they want — not that the government mandates they get. It includes important Medicaid reforms to ensure that Medicaid gets back on the path to solvency so that it can serve those it was created to — children and the disabled.  On top of ensuring protections for those who need it most, my vote was for a health care bill that would do what Obamacare failed to do — make health care and health insurance affordable for our families.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepMarkWalker/photos/a.399178923575199.1073741828.398458436980581/770288979797523/?type=3",NA,283,139,223,30,1,4,5,20

It's been sobering processing the realization that our entire team had been part of an assassination plot over the last several weeks. We had witnessed this guy lurking around our field in the early morning hours but never thought he would be capable of such a heinous act.   On several occasions, I have thought about how my position on the pitcher's mound would have placed me very close to the shooter, had I still been present on the field when the first shots were fired.   On paper, it should have been much worse. At our team meeting, we acknowledged the heroic acts of both members as well as the agents who saved the lives of members and staff. Yet, we believe God protected the team from a massacre due in large part to the people lifting us up in prayer each and every day.  I was honored to all members of Congress in prayer in the congressional auditorium shortly after the shooting. Prayer was also important enough for both Republicans and Democrats to join on bended knee asking for God's guidance, protection and healing for Rep. Steve Scalise.   At the game, Cedric Richmond and the Democrats were more than we could handle at the Nationals Park, and I would be remiss if I didn't mention several of my Democrat colleagues who have extended genuine concern over these last few days of sobering reality.  As I have stated, leaders must be disciplined in their rhetoric and speech. I have said from the beginning that tone matters. President Reagan was an example proving it is possible to accomplish both: stand up for our values and beliefs while exhibiting grace and statesmanship.  We live in a new time where anger and hate is being spewed at a feverish pitch. Even today, there are tweets and posts against me expressing that I am ""ok hurting children.""

Your catastrophic damage along the Gulf Coast has been overwhelming, but continues to be overpowered by the unparalleled work of everyday Americans. I am quite sure you noticed the strong work from our public officials, law enforcement, rescue personnel and devoted healthcare providers. However, as the floodwaters begin to recede, my guess is that you underestimated the true heroic will of the common man.  Neighbors looking out for neighbors, pick-up trucks and bass boats that organized their own rescue operations without any government intervention and nonprofits and faith-based ministries working around the clock to help bring hope to the hurting. And, as the world was watching, Texas represented in a way that made us all proud. It’s caused me to reflect on those infamous words - “Houston, we have a problem!” A time nearly five decades ago when America came together praying for the Apollo 13 crew, turning one of our darker hours into one of our brightest moments.  Harvey, I can understand how you miscalculated. A few weeks ago in Charlottesville, a small group of idiots, fueled by media attention, attempted to convey a false narrative of America. Yes, there is still room for growth in working through some painful memories, but your mighty blow did something quite unique - it revealed the core of our true character and just how far we have come. It proved once again when our nation faces adversity, disaster or tragedy, the bonds that tie us together grow stronger as the divisive voices are silenced.  America will continue to support and pray for our dispersed families and others, but Harvey, as we reflect on your damage in the weeks and years to come, please know that our lasting memory will be the depth of our strength rather than the damage of your storm.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepMarkWalker/photos/a.399178923575199.1073741828.398458436980581/826350897524664/?type=3",NA,64,6,18,19,0,0,0,0

Yet, the vast majority of these warriors have never been much on talk or grandstanding; rather, they continue standing on the wall, patrolling dangerous deserts, covering vast oceans and protecting the skies from lunatics wishing to annihilate us.  No, our flag is not a symbol of perfection and it's fair to say there's a few stains on Old Glory. However, she's done plenty to make amends and works with each passing generation to provide the greatest opportunities in the world for Americans from all races, religions and backgrounds.  Over the years, our flag has become a symbol to honor America's purest hero – the veteran. The very one who protects the right for others to kneel, ignore or protest the flag.   In the words of Arthur Ashe: ""True heroism is remarkably sober, very undramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever cost.""

In co-sponsoring H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, I debated and argued that babies - after twenty weeks in the womb - should be allowed to live. I am amazed that, in our country, such a battle would be necessary. Even with many exceptions included in this legislation, and though we know science reveals these tiny children recoil against such brutalization, 189 members of Congress – 187 Democrats and 2 Republicans – voted against life at this stage. Thankfully, 3 Democrats joined 234 Republicans to send this bill on to the U.S. Senate.  Frankly, this should not be a political party issue or even a religious matter but rather the humanitarian component should compel us to support these lives that are sustainable. Our goal should also be to share compassion rather than condemnation to those who’ve made such a fateful decision as we all benefit from God’s grace. However, we should also be resolved in our fight to stand up for the least of these who have no voice or “choice’ in the abortion process.  Some of us believe that all life should be protected but what does it say about our society that, even after 20 weeks, these infant children are described as nothing more than throw-away fetuses.  Currently, the U.S., along with North Korea and five other countries are the 7 out of 198 nations that permit abortions after 20 weeks. This is incredulous! Don't be fooled by the leading left’s language attempting to describe this late term abortion as women's health care or reproductive rights.  Forty-five years ago, we did not have the science and technology as we do today. It was wrong then and it is a horrendous process now as we literally can observe with our own eyes. The Psalmist David reminded us that children are fearfully and wonderfully made as the Creator forms us in the womb.

However, I reject the notion that in doing so we must abandon our prudence and principles, and use a non-transparent process in the House.  Read my op-ed in the The Wall Street Journal. Full text posted here:   Emergencies by definition are unpredictable. There was no way to foresee the havoc of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate. Each storm was devastating to those affected, and Americans are praying for healing and recovery.  Meanwhile, Congress should be preparing for future disasters. As unpredictable as hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis are, such emergencies should not be unexpected. It is only a matter of time before the U.S. faces the next catastrophe. But for some reason, the government does not budget with this in mind. Instead Congress waits for a crisis to happen and then hurries to pass an aid package afterward.  The latest example, set to come to a vote Thursday, is a $29 billion bill for hurricane response, wildfires and flood insurance. This comes on top of more than $15 billion appropriated last month. Tens of billions more have been requested for Florida, Puerto Rico, Texas and other areas, meaning that the total cost could be unprecedented once the final package gets through the legislative process.  Ideally, the government should run a surplus each year and put the extra money into a rainy-day fund. Congress should plan for worst-case scenarios to avoid last-minute scrambling. Governing by crisis is irresponsible, especially considering the national debt is already at $20 trillion. As then-Rep. Mike Pence said after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005: “Congress must ensure that a catastrophe of nature does not become a catastrophe of debt.”  There are several things Congress can do to minimize the budgetary damage of these aid packages. The easiest would be to write emergency-spending bills that exclusively address the crisis at hand. Of the $15 billion approved last month after Hurricane Harvey, only 22% is expected to be used in the next year.  Congress has a bad habit of loading up disaster-relief bills with handouts or other must-pass items. The aid package passed for superstorm Sandy included $25 million to improve weather forecasting; $86 million for unrelated repairs to Amtrak, which is already taxpayer subsidized; $16 billion in development funds for any community that was declared a disaster zone from 2011-13; and $2 billion for highway projects nationwide. The recent Harvey bill was packaged with an increase to the debt ceiling. It isn’t right to play politics with hurricane aid when Americans are genuinely in need.  Perhaps most important, Congress should pay for these emergency packages by cutting spending in other areas that are less of a priority. Hurricane aid shouldn’t be added to the debt. That’s akin to going to the Emergency Room after an injury, putting the charges on a credit card, and then pretending that the Visa bill is never going to arrive. The bottom line is that even during an emergency Washington needs to pay its bills.  Emergency spending can be offset in many ways. Lawmakers could pass a one-time bill rescinding old funds that have been appropriated but not yet obligated. Congress could pass reforms that trim spending over time while still improving government programs, such as putting work requirements on food stamps to save $19 billion over 10 years.  Just because Republicans control the White House and Congress does not mean the national debt can be forgotten. Political expediency should not trump principle. House Republicans worked hard over the past year to pass a budget that balances in 10 years. That blueprint includes cost-cutting measures and reforms that could be added to the aid bill to cover its cost.  Many of these proposals are also in President Trump’s budget plan, so lawmakers know he would sign them into law. Republicans in the House simply need to find the political courage to take the hard path by voting to offset fully the emergency spending. If the Senate then has other ideas, those can be worked out in conference. That’s how the process works. Having the House first negotiate with itself only gives up yardage before the ball is snapped.  Critics may claim this call for fiscal responsibility is insensitive to disaster victims. But I have yet to talk with anyone in Congress who thinks that government should stand by idly during an emergency. The cries for help are being heard. But equally clear is lawmakers’ obligation to future generations.","link","https://t.co/SHLpjOJxVk","t.co",76,48,5,0,0,1,0,2

Every year, loving families in America welcome thousands of children into their homes and into their lives to provide them with endearment and opportunity.

Today, we solidify that “the worker deserves his wages.”   For the first time since 1986, we are going to overhaul our broken tax code. Here is what that means for the families of North Carolina: For the first time in two decades, working families will finally get a much-deserved pay raise.

I am sending this message to you and your staff, Janine particularly, to thank you for everything you did to help with my father's circumstances concerning his VA check being taken from him.  If not for the diligence of Janine I do not believe that this issue would have been resolved before they took everything they deemed he owed to them.  As such my father and mother would still be in extremely dire circumstances.   I am so grateful for your help.  I could not do it alone and the VA advocate here in Person county had done all he could do.  We as a country are in dire need of Congressman and Congresswomen who are for helping our veterans as much as they need --for they give so much for so little in return. My deepest gratitude to you and Janine, also other staff persons in your office who helped us.  Sincerely,  Staci on behalf of Hine  Veteran of the United States Army  --------  Thanks Staci for your kind words. Whether it's help with the VA or another federal agency, our office is always here to serve the families of North Carolina.","status",NA,NA,61,1,3,5,0,0,0,0
