What we are proposing today steers health care sharply away from federal mandates, higher taxes and government control. Instead, our draft bill puts the focus on affordability, access to care with more choices, and safeguards Medicaid for the most vulnerable and needy.  The bill is not perfect, and because of budget rules it doesn’t include every prescription I would have liked. What I do know is that our path is a vast improvement over Obamacare and will finally start to build a health care system that works for many more Americans.  Over the next week, we will be working to improve on this draft with broad input from health care providers, patients, and every member of the U.S. Senate.","status",NA,NA,297,361,53,17,7,4,7,220

Tribal roads are some of the most dangerous and deadly in the country. With the Senate passage of this bill, we’re now one step closer to fixing these neglected roads and ultimately saving lives.   This legislation couldn’t have a better namesake. Wyoming’s John Smith was a life-long advocate for transportation safety who earned respect across the country—including at the White House. John brought tribal, state and local leaders together to improve safety on the Wind River Reservation. We couldn’t have passed this bill without John’s support and expert testimony before the Senate in years past. I look forward to the House passing this bill soon and adding to John’s already impressive legacy of improving lives across Indian Country.  http://bit.ly/2AtZHI8","photo","https://www.facebook.com/johnbarrasso/photos/a.10150091505520943.304058.21146775942/10155747048890943/?type=3",NA,93,21,5,6,0,2,0,2

Americans will now have a simpler, fairer tax code that will grow our economy, increase wages, and create jobs.   In addition to lowering the rates Americans have to pay, the bill doubles the child tax credit, allows more medical-expense deductions and keeps tax relief for retirement savings, charitable giving and mortgage interest. It nearly doubles the standard deduction to let folks keep more of their paychecks and save time when they file their taxes.   It also repeals one of the most unfair parts of Obamacare – the individual mandate tax. This means Americans will no longer pay a penalty if they decide that overpriced Obamacare insurance is not right for them.   I have always believed the best way for Washington to give Americans the most value for their money is to let them keep it at home. This bill does that, while making American businesses more competitive and unleashing the full potential of our economy.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/johnbarrasso/photos/a.10150091505520943.304058.21146775942/10155800244130943/?type=3",NA,218,159,28,36,1,2,8,103
