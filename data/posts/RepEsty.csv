The 2.6 million jobs that will disappear if the ACA is repealed with no replacement are too important to make it up as we go along.  The families who depend on ACA-funded programs to get the treatment they need to recover from opioid addiction are too important to make it up as we go along.  The rural hospitals throughout the country kept afloat by the ACA are too important to make it up as we go along.  For all the talk of a ""replacement plan,"" seven years after the passage of the ACA, Speaker Ryan and his colleagues haven't named even the slightest details of what a new plan might include, much less who would be covered by it. Let's be real here: there is no plan. Repeal IS the only plan we've heard after seven years.

Being opposed to repealing the law absolutely should not mean being opposed to making improvements that will help more people get quality health care.  - Donald Trump and congressional Republicans haven't told the public any details about what kind of system might ""replace"" the ACA.

Let today be the day that President Trump leads his Republican Party away from the shameful political crusade against Americans’ health coverage and begins reaching across the aisle on a real strategy to improve care for all Americans.   Let today be the day President Trump starts following through on his pledge to work together to revitalize our nation’s infrastructure, improve care for our nation’s veterans, and promote American manufacturing.

We are deeply concerned with the implications of the President’s recent executive orders. Targeting all Muslims in select Muslim-majority countries amounts to a religious test for entry into the United States. Fashioning policy around a single community or faith is not consistent with American values. American Muslims must play – and have played – a central role in combating extremism in all its forms. To drive a wedge between Muslims and the rest of America is not only immoral and unjust; it risks alienating families and communities across the country that play an integral role in our nation’s fight against terrorism.  Let us work together on a path forward that is fair and balanced, that keeps our nation safe, and that stays true to our American values. Let us work together to enrich ourselves and each other through education, which empowers us to embrace both our extraordinary diversity and our common humanity.

Jahvon spent his whole life believing he was a U.S. citizen. It’s the only country he’s ever known to be home. So, you can imagine his surprise when he turned 16, went to apply for driver’s license, and found out that the proper paperwork to ensure he was a citizen was not filed. Jahvon spent five years trying to navigate the bureaucracy on his own before he called my office. With our help, in a matter of months, Jahvon became a naturalized citizen, and was able to finally get his driver’s license and a social security card.  While I’m proud to be a part of Jahvon’s story in becoming a citizen, it’s a reminder that our immigration system creates unnecessary barriers for even hardworking, lifelong Americans like Jahvon. That’s just one reason why we should be focused on comprehensive immigration reform that focuses on keeping families together and attracting the best and brightest to the United States, rather than demonizing families who seek to make their home here.","link","https://esty.house.gov/about/constituent-corner-posts/esty-helps-watertown-resident-secure-us-citizenship","esty.house.gov",129,6,9,13,0,0,0,0

Attorney General Sessions compromised himself by failing to disclose, while under oath, his own conversations with the Russian ambassador. The White House failed to act for 18 days on the knowledge that National Security Advisor Flynn had lied about his ties with Russian officials. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Nunes undermined his credibility by back-channeling with the White House about his own committee’s investigation. Throughout, the President has made repeated false statements designed to undermine the FBI’s investigation of Russian interference in the November election — including a defamatory and grossly irresponsible allegation against his predecessor.  Now the President has fired the FBI Director just as the FBI had begun issuing subpoenas in the course of its investigation of the President’s associates and two days before the FBI Director was due to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee. It is also very troubling that immediately following the sudden firing of FBI Director Comey yesterday, the White House announced last night that the President would be meeting today with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov.

The reports, if true, suggest reckless handling of classified national security information from an important ally and potentially efforts to impede or end an FBI investigation into the President's campaign and administration.   Congress must act in accordance with the gravity of these extraordinary reports. We must immediately launch an independent investigation into President Trump's conduct that includes public testimony from current and former Department of Justice officials, subpoenas of relevant documents — including the memo or memos reportedly written by Director Comey describing the President's actions and words — and subpoenas of any recordings that exist of relevant conversations.  Now is the moment for every single representative to find the courage to put the good of the country before loyalty to party by allowing these very serious allegations to be investigated openly and honestly. Our democracy demands nothing less.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-investigation.html?_r=0","nytimes.com",215,82,35,3,6,4,4,21

They are our teachers, doctors, colleagues, small business owners, and civic leaders. Throughout history, extremists of all types have committed acts of terror to instill fear and to tempt us into abandoning our values. How we respond is a defining question for us. Do we allow ourselves to be baited into hate and bigotry? Are we a community that gives into fear and allows our neighbors to be terrorized and vilified? Or will we stand up for each other and for the values we share?   ""I know that those gathered here believe in the importance of freedom, compassion, and respect. But we must do more than talk about those values. We must make them the foundation of the communities we build, day in and day out, even when it’s not easy.

This horrific tragedy was not only the worst mass shooting in American history; it was also a terrorist attack and a hate crime targeting a mainstay of Orlando’s LGBTQ and Latino communities.  Today, I want the survivors and families of this tragedy to know that we stand with them, we grieve with them, and we cherish the memory of their loved ones whose lives were cruelly cut short. But words, on their own, are not good enough. We need to address the root causes of this attack and work together to prevent more families from suffering the same heartbreaking loss.  We must take action to stop the terrible epidemic of gun violence, which takes 92 lives on a typical day in our country. We must speak out forcefully against violence and discrimination – whether on the basis of race, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, or anything else – and bring federal anti-discrimination laws into line with our American values. And we must stand strong against hatred and terrorism in all forms, whenever and wherever they occur.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepEsty/photos/a.292109944225039.47251.292076514228382/961531893949504/?type=3",NA,51,2,32,4,0,0,37,0
