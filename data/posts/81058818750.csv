I share your concerns and am strongly opposed to recent decisions that endanger our national security and contradict our Nation’s core values. I have taken several steps to oppose these actions by President Trump, and have compiled an update on my website. One of the most concerning issues to date is the secrecy surrounding the Administration’s relationship with Russia. The intelligence community’s December 2016 conclusion that Russia had interfered with U.S. elections is disconcerting and alarming. In response, I have cosponsored H.R. 530, the SECURE Our Democracy Act and H.R. 356, the Protecting Our Democracy Act. H.R. 530 would sanction any foreign entity that has interfered in federal elections while H.R. 356 would create an independent commission to investigate attempts to influence the 2016 election by Russia.   Additionally, reports of discussions between Russian officials and Administration transition team are particularly troubling, and raise questions about potential violations by Gen. Flynn of the Logan Act. Though Gen. Flynn resigned from the post of National Security Advisor, his actions deserve closer scrutiny and oversight which is why I have asked Chairman Royce of the Foreign Affairs Committee to demand that Gen. Flynn testify before the Committee on the nature of his relationship with Russia. As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I will continue to monitor the situation and feel it is my duty to push for transparency and accountability for the American people.  http://sires.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-sires-response-to-the-actions-of-the-new-administration","link","http://sires.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-sires-response-to-the-actions-of-the-new-administration","sires.house.gov",79,8,10,6,0,0,0,0

I find his appointment to a high position in the White House disturbing, given his history of anti-Semitic, xenophobic and racist rhetoric. Last fall, I sent a letter to the President urging him to reconsider Bannon’s appointment in an effort to diversify his staff and create an administration that is inclusive and represents our core American values. Instead, President Trump has raised Bannon’s position within the Administration by appointing him to the National Security Council (NSC) while removing critical officers from the Principals Committee, such as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence. I informed the President of my concern that Mr. Bannon’s appointment puts American lives at stake and urged him to reconsider the politicization of the NSC.  In addition, I have cosponsored H.R. 804, the Protect the National Security Council from Political Interference Act of 2017, which bars the President from appointing aides to the NSC. http://sires.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-sires-response-to-the-actions-of-the-new-administration","link","http://sires.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-sires-response-to-the-actions-of-the-new-administration","sires.house.gov",49,6,1,0,0,0,0,0

The President’s January 25th Executive Order directing the Administration to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico will not only cost taxpayers billions of dollars, but will accomplish nothing in the way of reforming our broken immigration system and strain our security and business relations with Mexico.  The Executive Order on Sanctuary Cities threatens critical law enforcement funding and is counterproductive to improving national security.  I cosponsored H.R. 748, the Safeguarding Sanctuary Cities Act which would ensure that no federal funds are withheld from state or localities that choose to not comply with a voluntary immigration detainer request.  Furthermore, Trump’s executive orders suspending refugee resettlement and changing immigration policies for certain Muslim-majority countries contradict the very ideas of inclusion that America was founded on and discriminate unfairly against Muslims who are desperately trying to escape from life threatening conflicts.  Though the President’s order has been temporarily stayed by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, I have cosponsored H.R. 724, the SOLVE Act.  This legislation would nullify President Trump’s executive order on all refugees and the restrictions on those seven Muslim-majority countries. http://sires.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-sires-response-to-the-actions-of-the-new-administration","link","http://sires.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-sires-response-to-the-actions-of-the-new-administration","sires.house.gov",20,0,3,3,0,0,0,0

Defunding Planned Parenthood would make services such as preventative screenings, tests, and contraceptive services even more inaccessible, particularly in medically underserved areas.

It is our duty to ensure that we exhaust every option possible before sending our brave men and women into combat.

Specifically, it would reduce funding for the WIC program that provides nutrition and health services for women and children. It would completely eliminate the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) that helps keep New Jersey families warm through energy cost assistance. The proposed cuts to TIGER Grants and New Starts funding included in the President’s budget could limit New Jersey’s ability to build and maintain transportation and infrastructure.   Additionally, the proposal includes cuts to teacher training programs and programs for low-income and minority students. Reductions in the budget to the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) would jeopardize communities’ ability to prevent and respond to acts of terrorism. Finally, the budget would drastically decrease funding for the EPA and Superfund Program that provides for the cleanup of contaminated sites. Congress must work to ensure that these proposals do not become law.","status",NA,NA,14,7,9,0,0,2,4,15
