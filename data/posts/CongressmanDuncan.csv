To continue the band's tradition of participating in this historic event, we worked with Mike Lukach, a very important member of the Presidential Inauguration Public Affairs Office, who helped us secure approval for the band to participate in the parade as they have done for decades with both Republican and Democrat Presidents. I think it is a great honor and very special privilege for the band to represent our district's young talent in Washington D.C. They will remember being a part of history for the rest of their lives.

This week marks 75 years since US forces defeated the Japanese Imperial Navy, forever changing the course of history. Victory in this battle allowed the US and Allies to take the offensive position for the duration of the war. The Japanese came to the battle from June 4th to June 7th 1942 with the largest Armada they had ever assembled and the intention to finally defeat US Naval forces in the Pacific. An American Intelligence breakthrough cracked the Japanese fleet codes allowing us to anticipate and prepare for this attack. With our mere three carries to their four carriers, battleships, and cruisers, the odds of victory were not in our favor, a true underdog story. The land-based air supports that Midway Island allowed and our naval officer’s uncanny ability to adapt and think on their feet led to US success and kept our soil safe from Axis powers. I am incredibly proud of the work I have done in the past with the late Senator Jessie Helms and the International Midway Memorial Foundation to pass legislation declaring Midway Island a National Memorial so that it may be protected and forever serve to honor the American lives lost in the pursuit of democracy.","status",NA,NA,168,76,10,18,13,1,0,1

Douglas wrote that the law should not prefer “those who believe in no religion over those who do believe” and that there is “no constitutional requirement which makes it necessary for government to be hostile to religion and to throw its weight against efforts to widen the effective scope of religious influence.”   Justice Douglas was one of the most liberal justices who ever served on the Supreme Court.   It surprises many when I tell them we open every session of the House and Senate with prayer, that there is a prayer room in the center of the Capitol, and several Bible studies that go on in the Capitol each week.","status",NA,NA,697,278,246,56,16,8,23,82

During the ceremony and wreath laying honoring those who served our nation, I was surrounded by service members who put their lives on the line to preserve and protect our freedom. If you want to help honor and celebrate our Veterans, you can learn more about HonorAir at their website below. If you or a loved one were at this event, you can see all the pictures from the event in my picture albums.  http://www.honorairknoxville.com/#about","link","http://www.honorairknoxville.com/#about","honorairknoxville.com",88,49,4,10,0,0,0,0

All the men and women in our military have made sacrifices in their lives in order to protect Our Nation. From missing the growth of children, the ability to communicate with family, or the celebration of life events, the men and women in our military and their families selflessly put the safety of others before their own. It is my hope that everyone reading this today will stop and reflect on the amazing freedoms we have because of those who served.
