Johnson, who was sworn into Congress on January 3, is a nationally recognized constitutional law attorney, and previously served as co-chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the Louisiana House of Representatives.     “I am pleased to welcome Mike Johnson to our committee,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.). “Our committee will continue advancing a pro-growth agenda that is focused on making America stronger and more competitive. Congressman Johnson will certainly play an important role in achieving these goals and I look forward to working with him.”  The Judiciary Committee is often referred to as “the lawyer for the House of Representatives” because of its broad jurisdiction over matters relating to the administration of justice in federal courts, administrative bodies, law enforcement agencies, espionage, terrorism, the protection of civil liberties, constitutional amendments, immigration and naturalization, interstate compacts, and oversight of the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, among other areas. Due to the legal nature of the committee’s work its members customarily have a legal background. The committee’s weighty agenda has frequently placed it in a central role in American politics.  Additional committee assignments for Johnson and other new members are expected to be announced this week.    Johnson was elected on December 10, 2016, to serve Louisiana’s 4th Congressional District by the largest margin of victory in his region in more than 50 years.  More information on Johnson and the 4th District can be found at: www.mikejohnson.house.gov","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepMikeJohnson/photos/a.1626502034312310.1073741829.1625146381114542/1627094740919706/?type=3",NA,85,43,49,11,0,3,0,0

In 1960, the business was passed along to Mr. Fulco's daughter and son-in-law, Florence and Sam Fertitta, and was expanded to include the first imported food business in Shreveport. The now famous ""Muffy"" (short for muffuletta) was created ""by accident"" when Mr. Fertitta asked a friend to taste test a new bread that he used to build a delicious sandwich. The bread was good but the sandwich itself, with its special one-of-a-kind olive mix, became famous with folks lining up just to try it.    The building, like the sandwich has remained much the same over the years. It was listed on the National Registry of Historic Places in 1998, and in 1999, the street on which the building is located was renamed ""Fertitta's"" in honor of the landmark establishment.  The current owner, Agatha Fertitta-McCall, continues her parents' and grandparents' legacy.

In brief summary, the Hurricane Harvey event could last another week or more. First responders are continuing with life safety/rescue efforts at present, and all necessary resources appear to be in place. Most South Texas ports remain closed, and storm surges have registered as high as 6.7 feet in Port Lavaca.   This will be a very expensive storm in terms of monetary damages. Most attention is focused on Texas for now, but Louisiana is being prepared for our own fallout. Southwest LA is expected to receive as much as 10 inches of rain and additional threats of tornadoes ahead. Currently, we have a mandatory evacuation in Cameron Parish and voluntary evacuations in Iberia and Vermillion Parishes. A shelter has been opened in Rapides Parish and is housing 13 people at last report.   North LA is in process of arranging other potential shelters (e.g., in Shreveport at LSUS, Southern Univ., and State Fairgrounds in case evacuees need the space). Red Cross and Food Bank in Shreveport are preparing as well. Also, busses are being arranged in event New Orleans gets hit.    My staff in our Leesville office has reached out to the authorities in each of the most directly affected parishes of our district (Allen, Evangeline, Beauregard and St. Landry) for coordination. We all remain on standby to determine how much rain will fall.  Important warning is to avoid traveling on flooded roads, as most deaths during floods result from people inside their vehicles. Always remember: ""Turn around, don't drown.""   For those who want to donate to the cause, officials recommend the American Red Cross website.  Let's continue to pray for all those involved.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepMikeJohnson/photos/a.1626502034312310.1073741829.1625146381114542/1712694695693043/?type=3",NA,59,10,33,0,0,2,0,0

Here are the latest updates we have for our various areas:  Flash flood watches remain in effect for Desoto, Red River,  Natchitoches, Sabine, Vernon, St. Landry, Allen, Beauregard, and Evangeline until 7 PM tonight. Flood warnings will persist thereafter for at least Allen and Evangeline.   Flood warnings remain in effect for Bayou Anacoco near Rosepine and Bundick Creek in Beauregard.

No major flooding has occurred beyond that, and schools are open there are in St. Landry Parish.  In Beauregard Parish, some flooding has occurred on Sabine,  south of Toledo Bend with the flood gates being opened.  The Merryville Shelter currently has 7 people.  Caddo, Bossier, Webster and Bienville Parishes made out pretty well in terms of damage.  Currently one shelter is open in Shreveport with 22 evacuees, and two state-run shelters remain on standby.  No plans are in place for any command mtgs unless state shelters are activated.  The large amounts of rain have created dangerous conditions on the Red River, especially in Natchitoches and Alexandria.

If we do not win this appeal: A Jewish poet could be compelled by the government to compose an ode to Hitler; A Muslim t-shirt shop owner could be forced by the government to design a shirt that disparages Muhammad;  An African-American baker could be forced by the government to decorate a cake for a white supremacist rally;   And any number of other outrageous scenarios would be allowed to take place.

Their first treat was running into my friend and colleague, Congressman John Lewis, at the airport.   As we waited for our rides, the legendary civil rights leader told the boys about being the youngest speaker and one of the ""Big Six"" organizers at the 1963 March on Washington-- speaking to the enormous crowd after Dr. King's celebrated ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Wow!  I'm happy to show my sons that two men with different party affiliations and ideas can still get along in this town.  *ADDING THIS NOTE: Some of the comments below (right and left), remind me why my Commitment to Civility document (see: https://mikejohnson.house.gov/) is so important. Congressman Lewis and I agree on almost NOTHING politically, and I'm not sure if we have ever voted the same way on anything. But that does not mean he is my enemy. ISIS and Kim Jong-un are examples of our enemies. John Lewis is a fellow American. My task is to build relationships here, encourage respectful discussion and debate, and ultimately try to convince political opponents that our conservative arguments and philosophy are correct. We can never have an opportunity for that kind of influence if we simply label and avoid people (even when they do things with which we vehemently disagree). The Bible has a lot to say about this issue, and it informs the way I approach politics and life. I am ranked one of the most conservative members of the U.S. Congress, and will always be so.

In response to our reforms: AT&T has announced it will give out $1,000 bonuses to 200,000 employees; Fifth Third will raise its minimum hourly wage to $15 for all employees and hand out $1,000 bonuses to more than 13,500 employees; Wells Fargo is also raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour; and Boeing will move forward with $300 million in charitable giving and investments for its employees. Friends, this is just beginning, and we can expect many more exciting announcements like this in 2018!","link","https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurengensler/2017/12/20/att-gives-1000-bonuses-us-employees-tax-reform/#40556b3a7d61","forbes.com",118,47,35,18,9,1,1,0

The church, which was originally commissioned by Constantine the Great in 327 A.D., is built directly above the cave that marks the birthplace of Jesus Christ.   Since Joseph could not find lodging in Bethlehem, he and Mary found refuge in this cave near the village. We knelt at the very spot (now in the basement of the church) where Mary wrapped the baby Jesus in cloths and laid him in the manger, as record in Luke Chap. 2:  ""As the angel of the Lord told the shepherds then, 'Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.'  ""Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, 'Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom His favor rests.'”  As we celebrate the birth of the Savior--just as believers have since that first Christmas-- our family prays that you and yours experience all the peace, love and joy this season represents.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepMikeJohnson/photos/a.1626502034312310.1073741829.1625146381114542/1752975591664953/?type=3",NA,248,33,8,45,1,3,0,1

II: The unalienable right to life is listed first in the Declaration of Independence because it is the most fundamental. All human life is sacred, and I have always believed the rights of the unborn must be tirelessly defended. Thankfully, Congress has acted this year to protect our must vulnerable in significant ways.   For example, when we repealed an Obama-era rule that allowed providers like Planned Parenthood to receive Title X funding for their abortion services, President Trump signed our repeal into law.  The House also voted to finally make permanent the annual Hyde Amendment to prevent taxpayer funding of abortions. The provision has been credited with saving more than two million lives since the 1970s, and the pro-life community has long believed it should be a permanent part of federal law.   I am proud to have helped lead these and similar efforts and will always champion any legislation that defends the sanctity of human life.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepMikeJohnson/videos/1752976798331499/",NA,113,43,17,22,0,0,0,13

III: A top priority for this Congress and the president has been resolving America's illegal immigration crisis. It is essential for our national sovereignty and security to keep our borders safe and secure, and that is why I helped lead the passage of No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and Kate's Law to provide more tools to fight sanctuary city policies and impose harsher penalties for illegal immigrants who are repeat offenders.   To address the problem at the source, Congress appropriated the largest increase for border security technology and infrastructure in more than a decade.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepMikeJohnson/videos/1752977444998101/",NA,60,16,7,4,1,0,0,0

IV:  A primary responsibility of the federal government is to provide for the nation's defense, and to do so we must supply our troops with every resource they need to complete their mission. Over the previous eight years, our military capabilities and readiness were dramatically reduced by harmful budget cuts, but this year in Congress, we have worked tirelessly to correct that error. President Trump signed the NDAA to provide for renewed readiness, resources and reforms in our Armed Forces to adequately address emerging threats.   He also signed the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 which provides the secretary of the VA with full authority to swiftly remove bad actors in the system. While many VA employees are honest and work hard for our veterans, those involved in misconduct that put our veterans at risk must be held accountable.   In 2017 alone, we passed more than 40 bills in support of our veterans.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepMikeJohnson/videos/1752978771664635/",NA,34,8,4,5,0,0,0,1

I: The Obama administration enacted volumes of new and unnecessary regulations that negatively impacted the daily lives of many Americans, and the bureaucrats in charge seemed to have no concern at all about the enormous costs of implementing all that red tape. The Congressional Review Act allows rules and regulations to be reexamined after a president leaves office and, until this year, the act had only been used successfully on one occasion.   In the first few months of this year, Congress passed 14 CRA resolutions to roll back harmful and duplicative regulations so the America people can continue to build and prosper without the government getting in the way. It is estimated our resolutions will save more than $100 billion for taxpayers while reducing overreach and abuse by the federal government. Here's a look back at what we've done to curb duplicative and burdensome regulations this year -->","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepMikeJohnson/videos/1753329824962863/",NA,132,44,21,17,0,2,1,13

After we voted on the bill's final passage Wednesday, amid the thunderous applause, Steve Scalise gave me the vote sheet from his Majority Whip desk on the House Floor. It's an awesome piece of history, so I had him sign it, as well as Speaker Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers. (After I took this pic, I also got Vice President Mike Pence to sign it as well.)
