In Iowa the two largest insurers have already announced their departure from the market, and the third and final insurer is on the verge of leaving as well. This could leave over 70,000 Iowans with zero options for health insurance - it's clear that something needs to be done.   The AHCA will stabilize the market, lower premiums for Iowans, increase choices, reduce taxes, and protect people who have pre-existing conditions. I withheld my support - against the wishes of my own party - until changes were made to ensure that premiums would come down and that we would take care of those who need help by setting aside over $120 billion to assist citizens with pre-existing conditions. After years of higher costs, fewer choices and broken promises under Obamacare, it's time to enact a better system that actually works for Americans.  #IA01","status",NA,NA,190,484,50,7,4,2,24,263

The House worked hard to pass a compromise bill that repeals and replaces the broken Obamacare system, and the Senate should do its job and follow suit.   If the Senate can't get it done, we should simply repeal Obamacare with an effective date of two years from now that will encourage both parties to come together to improve our health care system. This week I signed a discharge petition in the House to do just that.  My goal in this process continues to be an American healthcare system that gives consumers choice, lowers costs, and takes care of Americans who need the help. This task is too important to give up on and I will keep working hard to find a solution.","status",NA,NA,122,223,20,4,14,5,2,96

I detest the status quo process we witnessed today: a backroom political deal that combined bills of totally different intent.”   Blum also added, “I voted ‘yes’ because those impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma should not suffer because of the repeated failures of career politicians in Washington. For our nation to be in the fiscal position to afford vital funding for FEMA, flood walls, and hurricane recovery, we must take the hard but necessary steps to control our 20 trillion dollar debt that will be passed on to our children and grandchildren.”","status",NA,NA,89,45,11,4,2,1,7,3
