One thing that is clear: this is going to require a concerted effort from all levels of government in order to develop tangible solutions for impacted homeowners.   Crumbling foundations have so far impacted 23 Connecticut communities. The damage to homes has the potential to harm the local housing market and could ripple across our state, hindering our efforts to achieve a full economic recovery. My office received confirmation last August that federal resources can be applied to this problem through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Local leaders are hard at work trying to leverage these resources, which combined with help from other stakeholders, insurers, lenders and home builders can stop the escalating harm this report identifies.

Under President Trump’s executive order, Somalia is one of the seven countries whose citizens are barred from traveling into the U.S., even a student like Ibrahim who has a valid student visa. The international student programs that are offered at eastern Connecticut colleges such as Conn College, UConn, and ECSU have a very important mission, not just for the individual students who benefit from attending our great schools, but also for the long-term benefit of fostering understanding and friendships that the students will take back to their native countries for the rest of their lives. It is “grass roots diplomacy” at its best, and it strengthens our nation’s standing in the world.

Make no mistake: this bill will impact every American, not just those who rely on the insurance exchanges and Medicaid. It rolls back provisions that guarantee insurance companies cannot charge women more money than men, must include ambulatory patient care and emergency services in ALL of their plans, and provide pediatric care, prescription drug coverage, and laboratory services as essential benefits. When Republicans tell you they are lowering premiums – they are not. Instead, they are simply allowing issuance companies to once again sell subpar and inadequate policies at cut-rate prices.    Since Speaker Ryan and House Republicans introduced their long-overdue health care proposal just 2 short weeks ago, the overwhelming consensus from medical organizations, patients’ rights groups, and advocates for senior citizens has been that this bill will be a disaster for tens of millions of Americans across the country. And yet, despite calls from their own moderate members, the Republican leadership and Donald Trump are determined to railroad this bill through Congress tonight.

Sadly, instead of doing the obvious and working with Democrats on a compromise, Speaker Paul Ryan publicly ruled out a bipartisan process and is instead putting forward a hyper-partisan fix known as “Amendment 25” in an effort to win over more votes within his conference.   In a nutshell, the amendment would allow states to strike Essential Health Benefits from insurance policies, weakening coverage for maternity care, behavioral health services, and emergency room care. The American Hospital Association, which represents thousands of hospitals across America, stated: ‘the amendment proposed this week would dramatically worsen the bill.’ The AHA was joined by the March of Dimes, the American Cancer Society, the AMA, and the American Nurses Association along with many, many other healthcare advocates in condemning this amendment.    If this bill is brought to the floor this week, there will not be enough time for a revised analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on its impact to the healthcare market or the federal budget.

Both of these individuals paid the ultimate price while serving in the military during the Iraq War. Jacob was lost on August 18, 2004, when he was struck by small-arms fire while patrolling the Sadr City neighborhood in Baghdad, and Keith was lost on May 28, 2007, after sustaining serious injuries when his helicopter was shot down.   I had the opportunity to read from a commemorative letter my office recently helped obtain from Lieutenant Heidtman’s former commanding general, retired General David H. Petraeus, honoring Keith’s sacrifice, but the sentiments he expressed can be applied to all of our nation’s heroes lost in combat. One portion of the letter reads as follows: “We must never forget the sacrifice of Lieutenant Heidtman and all the others who gave their lives for our country. They made the ultimate sacrifice fighting to defend freedoms and ideals that generations of Americans have cherished and generations of Americans have fought to protect. … They are heroes and we must always cherish the extraordinary sacrifices they made for our country.” If you have a moment, you can read the full letter from General Petraeus here: http://bit.ly/2rRMXqn","link","http://www.theday.com/article/20170529/NWS01/170529311","theday.com",38,0,4,1,0,0,0,0

President Trump failed to remember or understand that it was global action that eliminated Chlorofluorocarbons from the destroying the earth's ozone layer and smart regulation that stopped sulfur dioxide (acid rain) from destroying our nation's environment.  This decision is not only taking us backward, it also fails to capitalize on the growing industry being built around clean and renewable energy that is creating jobs right here in Connecticut.  In January, the Department of Energy released state-by-state statistics on employment in the energy sector which showed that solar energy jobs now account for a higher percentage of the electricity generation workforce in Connecticut than any other fuel source including natural gas.  Out of roughly 5,000 people employed in electricity generation across our state, nearly 3,000 work in solar energy in some capacity. Clean energy jobs are not only going to dominate our economy in the future – they are already a major part of our economy right now. Instead of desperately attempting to revive fossil fuel jobs that are likely gone forever, we should be investing money in clean technology and workforce training to move people into these valuable clean energy jobs.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/joecourtney/photos/a.430987469230.202563.330408799230/10155372761119231/?type=3",NA,86,31,12,2,1,0,11,17

The Trump Budget would eliminate the in-school interest subsidies for Stafford Student Loans, freeze Pell grants, eliminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, and significantly reduce federal work-study funds. Together, these proposals would dramatically increase college costs and make the already dire student loan crisis even worse.   In 2015, 70% of college seniors graduated with debt. This year, more than one in four borrowers is in delinquency or in default on their student loans. The worsening student debt crisis shows no signs of slowing down, and threatens the futures of young people all across America. They cannot invest in our economy, buy a home, or start a small business. I am urging President Trump to reconsider many of the proposals in his budget, particularly those impacting access to college aid, and to uphold his campaign promises to fight for the middle-class rather than cutting their lifelines.

In response to this signal, in 2014 Congress passed the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) to fund and update workforce training programs across the country connects American workers with the skills they need to succeed. This was the first update to America’s job training programs since 1998. Yesterday, one of my committees, the House Education & Workforce Committee conducted a hearing to get input on implementation of the 2014 WIOA. One of the witnesses, Ronald Painter, CEO of the National Association of Workforce Boards, highlighted the Eastern Connecticut Workforce Investment Board and its federally funded ‘manufacturing pipeline’ as an example of one of the most successful training programs in the country. He described how in the last year, EWIB’s metal trades program connected more than 400 people with new jobs in Eastern Connecticut, and there are new classes underway to keep up with more openings. Funding for EWIB comes jointly from the U.S. Dept of Labor and employers, such as Electric Boat.  It was great to see our region touted before the entire Congress, but the hearing also came with a caveat: President Trump's 2018 White House budget seeks to cut job training funds by a staggering 40%. If such a cut happened, the very programs that will open the door to good jobs in the manufacturing and health care fields, to name just a few examples, would as the witnesses testified have to reduce the number of training slots dramatically. This is the opposite of what America’s middle-class needs, and I will work with all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to block such a harmful, self-inflicted wound to our nation’s economy.","video","https://www.facebook.com/joecourtney/videos/10155418915754231/",NA,66,13,17,1,1,1,1,3

Today, I continued that fight by joining one of my Republican colleagues, Rep. David Valadao in sending a letter to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ask that he provide us with information on the Department’s review of Agent Orange exposure coverage for Blue Water Navy vets.  During the war, nearly 20 million gallons of the Agent Orange herbicide were used to clear vegetation as part of “Operation Ranch Hand” from 1961 to 1971. Blue Water Navy ships operated in the waters surrounding Vietnam, and sailors were unknowingly exposed to water that was contaminated with the chemical. Thus, some 90,000 Navy sailors were likely exposed to this toxic chemical used during the war even if they did not set foot on land. But for the past 15 years, the VA has refused to provide coverage for Blue Water vets. Rep. Valadao and I are hoping that the current review being conducted at VA will change that, and we will continue to pursue the VA to get more information until this is done.","link","http://www.norwichbulletin.com/article/20160223/OPINION/160229893","norwichbulletin.com",29,0,3,1,0,0,0,0

It was designed and constructed by David Bushnell from Saybrook, Connecticut. Its propeller was powered by foot-pedals and it had a hand-powered drill that was meant to attach time-bombs to the bottom of British ships. Turtle was deployed in New York Harbor in 1776, piloted by Ezra Lee from Lyme, Connecticut, but never managed to penetrate the hull of the British flagship.   The story of Turtle was recently featured in the Naval History and Heritage Command publication, along with several original documents about the vessel’s construction, and letters between George Washington and Thomas Jefferson discussing its potential.

John Larson and I had a productive meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to discuss the ongoing crisis of homeowners with crumbling foundations in north-central Connecticut. This meeting stemmed from a request Rep. Larson and I made for a meeting earlier this year, as well as the support we have received from the National Taxpayer Advocate. Specifically, we wanted to discuss an IRS “revenue procedure”, or a guidance document that, if approved would allow homeowners to deduct foundation repair costs from their federal taxes. The Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Policy directs the issuance of these documents, which are then prepared by the IRS. After meeting with the secretary and his staff, it is clear that they are engaged on this issue and understand the urgent situation facing residents in Connecticut. His office indicated that they would continue to evaluate the situation before making a final determination.   As we have said all along, there is not going to be one silver bullet that solves the entire problem of crumbling foundations for homeowners. Instead, we need a concerted effort at the municipal, state, and federal levels and this could be an important and valuable piece of the puzzle.

Shaquille is one of many young people in Connecticut and across the country known as DREAMers, meaning that they were brought to the United States as young children and have grown-up as Americans. Shaquille was brought to the U.S. from Barbados when he was just 5 years old. When the 2-year visas that brought his family to the U.S. expired, his parents made the decision to overstay and since then Shaquille has spent his entire life in Connecticut going to school and graduating from Enfield High School.   After high school, Shaquille then went on to Asnuntuck Community College and graduated in 2016 becoming an assistant manager at a local business, supporting himself and paying taxes. While he obtained temporary legal status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program known as DACA, he is now set to lose that reprieve after President Trump decided to rescind DACA last week.   As Shaquille’s story shows, the president’s order will punish children who have grown up in this country for the actions of their parents. Not only is this fundamentally unfair, it will lead to the indiscriminate deportation of some of the brightest and most talented young people in our country.

The order allows for the unfettered growth of “Association Health Plans” and exempts them from covering Essential Health Benefits such as maternity care or mental health care, leaving those patients unprotected and vulnerable.   This is not a new idea –  in the 1990s these plans existed and failed to protect thousands of patients from financial risk when they needed it most. These plans have generated heated opposition from experts, state insurance commissioners and others who know that ducking consumer protections is dangerous for patients.   Earlier this year I spoke about Association Health Plans on the House floor to explain this approach really enables a “race to the bottom”. Allowing insurance companies to decide what benefits are essential and letting them skirt rules that ensure that they have the funds to pay the bills is unsafe and irresponsible. This order is a monumental step backward from the goal of expanding quality and affordable coverage, and undermines the stability of our insurance market at a time when we should be discussing bipartisan ways to stabilize the market and thoughtfully build on the Affordable Care Act.","video","https://www.facebook.com/joecourtney/videos/10155769119354231/",NA,101,64,59,0,2,3,22,105

While I have long agreed that we need to overhaul our tax system that better serves our economy and our middle class, the approach outlined in this budget resolution marches in the opposite direction.   Specifically, the budget we will vote on tomorrow directly calls for the repeal of the state and local tax deduction. This deduction is not some tax break merely for millionaires, as some would have you think – 41% of Connecticut tax returns claimed this deduction on their tax returns in 2015, ensuring that these taxpayers did not have to pay federal taxes on income paid as taxes to the state or to their towns. Yes, high-income residents of our state and other higher tax states claim this deduction.

I welcome President Trump’s declaration of a public health emergency yesterday as a step towards recognizing the severity of the crisis.   This declaration, however, falls short of the tangible steps I believe are needed to combat the opioid crisis. Across eastern Connecticut, what I have heard is that those responding on the front lines need more funding to expand treatment bed availability, access to life-saving Narcan, and intervention efforts to prevent opioid addiction. Yesterday’s action, however, unlocks no new resources to address these and puts no new funding in the Public Health Emergency Fund that is unlocked by the declaration - that fund has only about $57,000 in it today.   I hope that President Trump’s declaration is a start, not an end, to his administration's efforts to tackle the opioid crisis.

The measure includes $40 million in state funding to provide relief and assistance to homeowners impacted through a new captive insurance company. I have been in close contact with many of eastern Connecticut’s state legislators throughout the session to urge action, and I applaud them for their hard work. I will continue to support these legislators, town officials, and homeowners, doing everything I can to help implement these budget provisions as smoothly as possible.   At the federal level, I continue to push for a tax deduction from the Treasury Department and IRS that would allow homeowners to deduct the cost of foundations repairs from their federal taxes. I was encouraged by the support of Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, with whom Rep. John Larson and I met in September to discuss the possibility of such a deduction. Following the meeting, Mr. Larson and I sent a letter to Assistant Secretary Kautter, and our offices remain in close touch with Treasury and IRS as they continue to evaluate our proposal. I am hopeful that we will be able to complete this process soon.   I was particularly pleased that the package passed this week authorizes use of a federal HUD loan guarantee program that could provide up to 60 million dollars the state. My office secured this offer from HUD in August 2016 and was approved in an amendment I introduced with John Larson in the 2018 Appropriations bill passed in the US House this past July.

Our letter asks for a full five-year extension of the federal funding that supports community health services across eastern Connecticut, our state, and our nation.  About 376,000 people were served by community health centers in Connecticut in 2016 alone, and about 27 million nation-wide.

While the plan on its face would lower taxes for some, it eliminates specific provisions that families in eastern Connecticut rely on. For instance, the proposed tax plan would eliminate the deduction for state and local income and sales taxes - a repeal that would disproportionately affect taxpayers in higher cost states like Connecticut. It also repeals the deduction of student loan interest and and college expenses, and eliminates the newly expanded family credit - a worthy effort - after five years.   This bill is simultaneously packed with giveaways to the wealthiest taxpayers and largest corporations. The bill eliminates the estate tax, a tax that affects only the wealthiest Americans and less than 1% of taxpayers. This provision alone will increase the national deficit by an estimated $172 billion.  Instead of working across the aisle on a thoughtful and bipartisan approach to simplifying and improving our tax system, House Republicans are rushing to move this plan -- released only hours ago -- through the legislative process as fast as possible. Every single American is impacted by the changes that will be made by this measure, and deserves an open and transparent process. I’ll continue to work on a plan that boosts our middle class and supports eastern Connecticut taxpayers. A rushed package of tax cuts for those that need them the least, however, is not the way to go.  http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-gop-tax-plan-middle-class-20171102-story.html","link","http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-gop-tax-plan-middle-class-20171102-story.html","chicagotribune.com",119,106,71,3,3,6,22,102

The review does not sugar coat the fact that glaring deficiencies in training and leadership subjected our Sailors and ships assigned to the Western Pacific region to unacceptable risks. With increasing operational tempos in the region, the forward-deployed ships based in Japan -- which included both the USS McCain and USS Fitzgerald -- largely operated outside of the regular guidelines and “fire breaks” that monitor crew readiness and ship conditions. As a result, and as these reports outline in a sobering and heartbreaking manner, ships and their crews were deploying regularly without the certifications and training they needed - and without the leadership structure to call “time out.”  The Navy’s review outlines a list of 58 recommendations aimed at getting to the root of these problems. However, there are a few that I believe the Navy should focus on and implement without delay - such as establishing a single headquarters command that is solely responsible for the manning, training and equipping of Navy forces in the Western Pacific.  As Ranking Member of the House Seapower and Projection Forces subcommittee, I am committed to ensuring that Congress will be an active partner in ensuring that the recommendations are acted on and that the Navy has the resources and support it needs to get it done.   This cannot be a moment that passes without action and follow-through. It has to be the start of real and tangible change. Our Sailors, their families, and the nation that relies on them to preserve our security at home and around the world should expect nothing less.  http://www.theday.com/military-news/20171102/navy-review-finds-gaps-in-training-basic-seamanship-in-western-pacific","link","http://www.theday.com/military-news/20171102/navy-review-finds-gaps-in-training-basic-seamanship-in-western-pacific","theday.com",17,4,3,0,0,0,3,0

The VA has had more than 18 months to review a National Academy of Medicine report which drew stronger connections between Agent Orange exposure and medical conditions experienced by Blue Water Navy Veterans. The longer a decision is delayed, the more veterans are left without the care and support they need.   I have repeatedly called on the Veterans Administration to provide a presumption of exposure for U.S. service members who served in the territorial seas of Vietnam during the Vietnam War. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, which would codify this change into law.

One issue I am hearing a lot about is the elimination of the deduction for graduate student tuition waivers. Approximately 145,000 graduate students currently rely on these nontaxable tuition waivers, typically earned through part time work as a teaching or research assistant. Provisions in this bill would tax these tuition waivers as income, costing these students $2K or more per year. I am deeply concerned about the impact this will have on a higher education focused district like ours.   One of the letters I have received is from Elizabeth from Danielson, which describes how this change will impact her:  “I grew up in CT with parents who never went to college and feel fortunate that they encouraged me to pursue knowledge. Under the current tax plan, my graduate school tuition is not taxed. This is money that my institution pays towards courses that it requires for my training as a scientist. I don't ever see this money, but I see the financial statements as evidence that the courses are paid for. Under the proposed plan, I would be taxed for my tuition. This would add approximately $40k per year to the $30k that I am taxed on. In total, my taxable income would be $70k. Currently I take home approximately $25k per year. Under the proposed plan, I would take home less than $20k. If I am already working 60+ hours per week towards my training as a PhD level scientist, I will not have time to work at a second job.”  An investment in higher education is an investment in our economy. We should be catalyzing its growth and advancement, not hiking up its price tag. I will oppose this misguided tax bill and its impact on higher education.  http://www.courant.com/education/hc-republican-tax-plan-higher-education-20171109-story.html","link","http://www.courant.com/education/hc-republican-tax-plan-higher-education-20171109-story.html","courant.com",29,16,7,3,0,0,2,8

Connecticut already pays more in federal taxes than payments it receives back and, incredibly, this bill will worsen that disparity. My office received over 1,800 emails and calls from constituents that “ran the numbers” and demonstrated how the bill will increase their burden. Sadly, the 10 day “process” shut out any opportunity to listen to that type of intelligent input and instead the bill was rushed to the floor- without a single hearing and a closed rule that blocked any amendments from being considered.  This week is National Apprenticeship Week, a time in which we highlight time-tested and proven programs to connect workers to the skills they need for today’s jobs. This bill represents a broken promise to grow the U.S. economy, which has a shortage of skilled workers. The obliteration of the student loan interest deduction, which will add $24 billion to the cost of higher education as well as the taxation of graduate students' tuition waivers, 60 percent of which are concentrated in STEM curricula, and the elimination of tax-free employer-funded tuition assistance, to enhance workplace skills and often using apprenticeship programs, moves this country in exactly the wrong direction. We need to close the skills gap in our workforce, which is a challenge that impacts every corner of our nation.   Action now moves to the Senate, which is expected to take up its bill later this month. Thank you to all those who have contacted my office to share your concern and questions about this plan.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed to hear that the Labor Department is continuing to encourage companies to adopt apprenticeship standards that do not mirror the national certification standards first established through the National Apprenticeship Act- legislation drafted in 1937 by one of my predecessors, U.S. Representative William Fitzgerald of Norwich. This legislation, commonly referred to as the “Fitzgerald Act,” created apprenticeships as we know them today: programming in manufacturing and other sectors that open pathways to high-quality jobs and position workers for success in the future.  Filling the “skills gap” in our country starts with high-quality training and development programs.

Their taskforce approach brings together local, state, and federal law enforcement to coordinate all efforts to get these dangerous drugs off the streets in our state.  Alarmingly, they reported that three people die from an overdose every day and that Fentanyl-related deaths in Connecticut increased by a shocking 544% between 2014 and 2016. Encouragingly, the DEA reported that the long upward trend in overdose deaths could be slowing, a sign that getting Naloxone into the hands of first responders is working. However, not all towns have the financial resources to arm their officers with this life-saving drug, a financial barrier that results in preventable loss of life and untold tragedy.    These DEA officials agree that in order to really make headway towards ending this crisis, we need to approach both the supply of drugs entering the community and provide lifesaving emergency care and long-term recovery to those struggling with addiction. This starts with funding what we know works.

Over the last 19 months, we have sought the input of experts, met with IRS and Treasury officials and honed the policy arguments to make the case that crumbling foundations should be recognized by the federal government as a casualty loss deduction from federal taxes. In every call and meeting, I shared the pictures and stories of homeowners across north-central and eastern Connecticut who were grappling with this problem. It powerfully conveyed the scale and scope of the problem and the need for help from Washington.   With this announcement, the federal government has said ‘yes’ to helping homeowners struggling with the cost and damage of crumbling foundations. This tax guidance adds a powerful new tool to the toolbox of options for homeowners and communities looking for a way to get their arms around this extensive and long-term problem for our region. It also dovetails with recent action on the state level, as well as additional efforts to expand aid and support to homeowners and communities.   The origins of this effort started at the grassroots level from homeowners speaking out at community meetings, organizing as Connecticut Coalition Against Crumbling Basements, and petitioning their elected representatives. At a time of unprecedented polarization and dismay with our government, I hope that the outcome in this effort provides some measure of hope that the system can still work the way it’s supposed to -- and that bipartisan work can achieve a positive outcome for individuals, families and our communities.

As written, the bill represents nothing less than a massive transfer of wealth from working-class families to the elite by slashing popular programs and deductions while cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations. Specifically, the elimination of state and local tax deductions will deliver a huge blow to CT taxpayers, many of whom rely on itemization during the tax season.   Adding salt to the wound, this tax plan is set to blow up the national deficit by an estimated $1.4 trillion, posing an enormous threat to the future of vital programs like Social Security and Medicare.   The tax bill is now headed to conference committee where a reconciliation of the House and Senate version of the plan must be agreed on before final passage. I urge my Republican colleagues to reconsider the impact this effort will have on the middle class and help us stop this plan from burdening millions of hardworking families.  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/opinion/editorials/a-historic-tax-heist.html","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/opinion/editorials/a-historic-tax-heist.html","nytimes.com",48,32,11,0,2,0,0,28

Guest speaker Gerald Culliton, Director of VA Connecticut Healthcare System, joined me for the roundtable as we covered measures to expand VA services, specifically sexual trauma counseling and treatment for members of the military reserves.  Until recently, these members were excluded from receiving this type of treatment due to a technicality in the law. I am happy to report that the recent National Defense Authorization Act passed in the House included a fix for the reserve members.   I was also happy to announce the recent arrival of the VA’s veteran ID cards. This feat is the result of a two-year effort to make sure our veterans have adequate identification without having to carry around cumbersome and potentially sensitive paperwork verifying their veteran status. Several members of the board reported successfully applying for and receiving their cards, and I hope other veterans will take advantage of this new resource.   Director Culliton answered questions about challenges that veterans face with parking at the West Haven facility. After two years of severe concerns about the lack of patient parking at the West Haven hospital, the VA has finally obtained a new property adjacent to the hospital that will allow them to create 165 new parking spaces. Mr. Culliton also gave an update on construction of the state-of-the-art behavioral health facility at the hospital which will open spring 2018 and reported that the new women’s center has been a great success and patient volume has already maxed out the available clinical space. Director Culliton’s team will now begin working to enhance those services at the women’s center even further.   Finally, I was able to update the board on the status of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, a bill that would extend medical and disability benefits for vets exposed to Agent Orange during Vietnam. Despite persistent delays by the VA, I will continue press this issue until these veterans receive the care they need and deserve.","link","https://courtney.house.gov/media-center/in-the-news/day-courtney-says-more-military-personnel-may-seek-treatment-sexual-trauma","courtney.house.gov",45,5,4,0,0,0,0,0

The review makes serious recommendations on how the Navy should train, man, equip, organize, and command the surface force around the world.  Some reforms have already been implemented by the Navy using its existing authorities. Other changes will require action on the part of Congress. For example, for many years legislative language in the annual defense funding bill has mandated a split between the Pacific and Atlantic fleets of our surface forces, which as the new review points out has led to confusion in responsibilities and lack of consistent standards across the fleet.  I believe the Secretary’s review makes a strong case to Congress for the need to rethink this policy. I discussed the need for Congressional action with Breaking Defense recently. The completion of these reviews marks the beginning of a process for both the Navy and Congress to implement and oversee reforms needed to address the shortfalls exposed by the collisions. We owe it to the families of our lost sailors and to the families who entrust us to give their sailors the training and resources they need to do their job safely and effectively.
