After all of the Republicans’ hollow promises, the devastating reality of their cruel plan has been revealed.  It’s no wonder why they pushed this reckless and irresponsible mess forward in the middle of the night and are in such a huge rush to force this poisonous prescription down the throats of the American people.    Their bill would deprive 24 million Americans of their healthcare coverage while handing billionaires a deficit-busting tax break. And it will also significantly weaken Medicare and Medicaid.   Trumpcare will make America sicker, not stronger; and I will work tirelessly to defeat it.  Key Findings of the CBO Report  24 million Americans will lose their health coverage – including 14 million in 2018 alone.  301,000 individuals across Missouri who have gained coverage via the ACA could lose their coverage.  38,000 citizens in Missouri’s 1st CD could be stripped of their healthcare coverage.  225,878 individuals in Missouri who received financial assistance to purchase ACA Marketplace coverage in 2016, averaging $315 per individual, are at risk of having coverage become unaffordable under the Republican plan.  Women in the state who can now purchase insurance for the same price as men are at risk of being charged more for insurance if the Republican Congress eliminates the ACA’s ban on gender rating.  Under the GOP bill, 19 percent of the nonelderly population will be uninsured in 2026, compared to 10 percent in 2026 under current law…almost doubling the number of uninsured Americans.  The bill would have the effect of slashing Medicaid by $880 billion over the next 10 years.  Under the GOP bill, a 64-year-old with an income of $26,500 in the individual market will pay $12,900 more in their premiums each year.  By defunding Planned Parenthood for one year, the bill would have the result of many women losing access to care, including contraceptives and other family planning services.    The bill gives $600 billion in tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans and large corporations – including $2.8 billion to the 400 richest families in America alone.","status",NA,NA,49,14,5,2,0,0,1,4

It is unacceptable to continue ignoring these scandals.”   With respect to the Oversight Committee’s lack of action to date, the letter states:   “Although Chairman Chaffetz recently sent a letter to the Department of Justice Inspector General, we believe that response is anemic—especially for the Oversight Committee, which claims to be the premiere investigative body in the House of Representatives—and particularly in comparison to the multiple ‘emergency’ hearings he called and the unilateral subpoenas he issued as part of the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.”   With respect to the Judiciary Committee’s lack of action to date, the letter states:   “On several occasions—through at least four letters to Chairman Goodlatte, and in debate on three separate resolutions of inquiry debated in the Judiciary Committee—we have called for the Majority to take action ‘to ensure the integrity and independence of both the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’.”   The Members conclude:   “We are concerned that the continued failure of House Republicans to take action in the face of this onslaught of allegations will cause significant damage to the faith that the American people have in the credibility and integrity of our Committees and the House of Representatives.  We have a solemn obligation under the Constitution to act as a check on the Executive Branch and to hold President Trump accountable.  It is time to do our job.”   The letter requests an immediate public hearing with Director Comey and copies of all of the FBI Director’s memos relating to the President, as well as all associated agency and White House records, including any audio tapes, and notes, if they exist.     The letter also requests that the Oversight Committee schedule an immediate vote on a motion to subpoena the White House to produce documents it has been withholding in response to the bipartisan request from Ranking Member Cummings and Chairman Chaffetz on March 22, 2017.  All Democratic Members of the Oversight Committee sent a letter to Chairman Chaffetz on April 27, 2017, insisting that he press the White House to produce these documents, but the Chairman refused to even hold a meeting.

Foreign governments have granted preliminary approval of trademarks, paid to stay at Trump hotels, and are leasing space at Trump properties.  President Trump continues to prioritize his business interests – and the interests of the foreign governments who give him money – over the interests of the American people.   We cannot trust Trump to put the American people first when he’s getting cash and benefits from the rest of the world.  Right now, the American people are in the dark. Americans deserve to know if President Trump is making policy decisions for his own financial benefit. American jobs and national security are at risk.  There is a complete lack of transparency by the Administration or any form of oversight by the Majority in Congress.

Lacy Clay","2017-09-15","2017-09-15 17:32:36","Once again, another young Black man dies at the hands of a police officer…with no consequences.  Jason Stockley acted as judge, jury and executioner. He violated multiple department regulations, and he showed a total disregard for the life of my constituent, Anthony Lamar Smith.  Justice has been cruelly denied for Anthony Lamar Smith’s family and this community.    I stand in total solidarity with them in expressing my absolute outrage at this verdict.  Our communities need and respect good policing.  A few bad apples denigrate the entire force and place officers and citizens unnecessarily in harm’s way when they meet.  We must demand changes in local law enforcement to ensure all lives are respected and honored. There is no coming back after a life is taken, only sadness.     Black Lives Matter, and that declaration is not meant to diminish or denigrate the value of any other group,  It is simply an honest statement of the ugly and very painful truth that in America, in 2017, some lives are still worth more than other lives.  Our young people are outraged and angry about that…and so am I. I  This tragic case also underscores the urgent, fundamental question that our nation, our state, and our community have thus far failed to honestly address…how do we transform local law enforcement and our criminal justice system to finally provide equal justice under the law for all…instead of just for some.  The federal legislation that I have already introduced could provide some of the answers because it would mandate increased sensitivity training for all police officers to help them deescalate potentially violent situations before they become deadly.   My bill also requires the appointment of an independent prosecutor in all instances when police use deadly force.    And my legislation incentivizes the use of body cameras by all local police departments who compete for Justice Department grants.    These transformative changes would make a huge difference in bridging the trust deficit that still divides many police officers from the citizens they are sworn to serve and protect.","status",NA,NA,332,96,120,20,2,4,48,38

Families like President Trump's will be richly rewarded while over 320,000 middle-class families in Missouri will get a tax increase.  In fact, 83% of the tax cuts in this deeply flawed and fiscally irresponsible bill will pad the pockets of the top 1%.  This terrible and destructive bill will rob seniors by cutting over $25 billion from Medicare to help pay for tax cuts for billionaires.  It will strip away healthcare coverage from 13 million Americans.  And it will explode the debt by putting at least $1 trillion more on the national credit card which our children and grandchildren will pay for.  This isn't tax reform...it's tax fraud.
