While the U.S. military strikes ordered in response may prevent Assad from carrying out future chemical attacks against the Syrian people, I am concerned by the Trump Administration’s lack of consultation with Congress before carrying out the attacks. Congress has a fundamental duty to provide consent for comprehensive military strategy and to shape the parameters in which we engage with our adversaries. Congress can no longer abdicate it’s responsibility and must immediately consider a new Authorization for Use of Military Force before taking any further actions against the Assad regime in Syria.   Additionally, Congress must take steps to provide increased humanitarian assistance to Syrians suffering from years of brutal civil war, including those displaced in country as well as refugees seeking security for their families. This includes reexamining our refugee policy so that the United States can provide a safe haven for the many Syrians who have been displaced by war. It’s crucial to remember the actions taken last night will not provide a lasting political solution to the crisis in Syria.   We must continue, however difficult, to seek a diplomatic and permanent end to the Syrian civil war and partner with our allies to reduce regional chaos. http://bit.ly/2oam6TS","link","http://bit.ly/2oam6TS","bit.ly",127,23,10,5,0,0,0,0

Director Comey has had three of those in-person meetings, and six on the phone, with President Trump in just four months. I look forward to hearing more about those conversations tomorrow.  Until then, we have Director Comey’s statement for the record, which is deeply concerning. The president may “expect loyalty,” but the American people expect accountability and answers. In other words, we will not “let this go.” Director of the FBI is not a patronage job, and it is not the responsibility of the FBI or anyone else in government to “lift the cloud” looming over the Trump-Russia probe.

Nothing about this bill makes any economic sense.   By eliminating deductions for state and local income tax, medical expenses, and student loan interest, this bill makes it harder to climb the economic ladder and achieve the American Dream. Seniors, homeowners, teachers, and students–in many ways, the backbone of our economy and our society–stand to lose the most under this legislation. Although, it’s clear that President Trump and his family will do very well from the business tax reductions under this bill, there is no evidence that ordinary workers will see any significant changes in their paychecks.

So far this year, 25 transgender individuals have been killed, the highest number of recorded deaths in a single year.

While I’ve introduced this legislation every session since I was first elected, I believe the Transparency in Government Act is needed now more than ever. The American people are justifiably fed up with the government’s failure to instill common-sense transparency measures that increase public access and restore public trust. This year alone, we’ve seen federal agencies scrub information from their official websites and federal appointees fail to disclose potential conflicts of interest.
