I hope you'll take a minute to read:  Unfortunately, the House Committee on Financial Services today started the process of repealing Wall Street reforms that were put in place to prevent another financial crisis like the one we saw in 2008.  I'm opposed to repealing these reforms on Wall Street. It is the wrong choice for middle class Michiganders because it would take us back to the dark days when abusive Wall Street practices nearly crippled our economy. Back to the days when millions of people lost their homes, lost their jobs and saw their 401(k) retirement savings wiped out.   My constituents are still feeling the effects of Wall Street's greed. The financial crisis hit our state especially hard. Many Michigan families’ homes are still worth less than before the recession. Today, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Michiganders own fewer cars, earn less money, and work fewer hours than before the financial crisis.  I have a simple question for my Republican colleagues who are pushing this terrible plan to repeal Wall Street reforms: have you forgotten the lessons of the financial crisis? We cannot turn a blind eye to the continued economic pain for so many American families. It is an absurd idea that we would put Wall Street back in charge of policing itself. It's foolish for us to reinstate big bank bailouts. This bill is a recipe for disaster. It puts our economy at risk and is the wrong direction for our country.  Here's my comments in committee against this terrible plan. I hope you'll take a minute to watch and share.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepDanKildee/videos/1562104737165511/",NA,229,54,127,13,0,6,6,41

Instead, President Trump has dangerously decided to pull America out of the Paris Climate Agreement that seeks to address climate change, jeopardizing our domestic security and putting us at odds with our allies around the globe.  We have a moral responsibility to recognize that climate change is real and requires urgent action. We cannot afford to pretend that climate change is not real. The effects of climate change are evident all around us: surging asthma rates, deadly floods and droughts, and rising sea levels. To deny these effects of climate change on our children and communities will prove to be a grave mistake.  Climate change is also a real threat to the Great Lakes. In addition to current threats like pollution and invasive species, climate change presents new stressors for the Great Lakes. They could forever change if we allow climate change to deplete Great Lakes water levels and increase water temperatures, changing not only habitats and ecosystems, but also jeopardizing our jobs and economy that relies on our water resources.","status",NA,NA,197,71,28,1,2,2,31,31

During the Obama Administration, I worked almost daily with a point person, Dr. Nicole Lurie, and federal agencies, many of whom were on the ground helping Flint families. We also got Congress to pass $100 million in aid for Flint last year that was signed into law by President Obama in December 2016.

I talked with NPR about how we can act to protect public health and prevent another tragedy like the Flint water crisis from happening elsewhere. There is no safe level of lead in drinking water, which is why I am fighting for a lead-free water system.  Listen here: http://n.pr/2zzox8V","link","http://n.pr/2zzox8V","n.pr",45,9,5,2,0,0,0,0

We can't afford to saddle our children with trillions more in debt to pay for this tax scam that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest Americans.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepDanKildee/videos/1817876091588373/",NA,160,79,75,4,11,2,5,36

Kyle Kuzma’s story is another shining example of the great work they do every day to provide more opportunity for local area youth.   If given the opportunity, our kids can grow up to do whatever they put their minds to. That’s why I will continue to fight for funding for after school programs and great organizations like the YMCA.","link","http://lat.ms/2zXEsya","lat.ms",40,12,3,5,0,1,0,1

However, I can't support any tax plan that raises taxes on many middle class families, all to give tax cuts to the richest Americans and big multi-national corporations.
