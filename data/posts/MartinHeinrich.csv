Despite what some have claimed, I have challenged PhRMA on their top legislative priority and was an original cosponsor of the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act, which sought to allow the federal government to use its purchasing power to drive a hard bargain with manufacturers and negotiate lower prescription drug prices.    I also supported the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, which is now law and puts in place state-of-the-art tracking and tracing of pharmaceuticals through the supply chain here in the U.S. to protect consumers against the threat of counterfeit, mislabeled or diluted drugs.  While being able to afford your prescriptions can be a life or death issue, so can ingesting something that has been altered or counterfeited by someone trying to make a quick buck - here or anywhere else in the world. Both access and safety are critical issues and I have been focused on each.   On the importation vote, the promise of being able to access cheaper prescription drugs is obviously a goal I have long shared, but so is ensuring the integrity of those drugs.  I know a few folks have dismissed the legitimacy of safety issues because the industry has expressed some of them, but the FDA, World Health Organization, AARP and many others share my concern.   FDA commissioners for the past three U.S. Presidents – including this one – have outlined serious safety warnings and said that they do not have the resources to protect consumers when it comes to imports - even if they are shipped through Canada. The World Health Organization has suggested nearly 1 in 10 pills imported into the U.S. are counterfeited.  And even AARP has said that, ""if reimportation is allowed, it is important that the FDA be provided the resources and authority to ensure the safety of re-imported drugs from Canada, and that technological and other safeguards be employed.""   So during the vote, I discussed the issue with the amendment sponsors and told them, ""Count me in on imports if we can ensure FDA safety standards.""  If safety concerns were better addressed, I would have supported the amendment.  We know this is important, we hear you and I intend to make progress toward providing better prescription drug access and safety.   We must also not lose sight of the extra $1,000 a year seniors will pay for their prescriptions and the millions who will lose all of their health care if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.  We must work together and have a united front to hold the Trump Administration accountable and fight back against those who believe consumers don't matter and that profits are more important than people.","status",NA,NA,215,312,104,2,3,1,9,53

As a breast cancer survivor, having coverage made the difference between life and death for Francesca from Albuquerque.   Here is her story: ""In December of 2011, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. No one understands what it means to hear the words: ""You have cancer"" until they are spoken to you. I remember sitting in my doctor's office and how I felt like I had been given a death sentence. Fortunately for me, my cancer was found early. But had I not had the coverage so that I could have gotten a mammogram, I might be dead today as it was a tumor close to my breast bone and had I waited just one year for that mammogram, it probably would have entered into my bones. It was a hard journey, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation but I survived and am thriving today. In July, I will be five years cancer free. If I had not been covered by the ACA, I would not have been able to receive care or the medication needed to continue care for the last five years. I would not be here to enjoy the lives of my grandson who was born three years ago and my twin granddaughters who just turned one. If I hadn't had that coverage, I am sure I would have lost my life.

President Trump must present a long-term strategy for Syria and request the appropriate Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) from Congress.

I remain adamantly opposed to the introduction of significant ground troops in Syria and believe that we cannot and should not become directly entangled in a civil war in the Middle East.   Regardless of who is President, or which party occupies the White House, I believe that we have a moral obligation to act when a regime violates international law and gasses its own people with impunity.  The use of chemical weapons is sickening and has long been widely condemned by the international community.  Last night, our brave men and women in uniform sent an important message to the world that the United States will not stand by when chemical weapons kill dozens of innocent people, including children.

But it wasn't just the deplorable violence and murder that was so shocking, it was also the sense that President Trump was reticent to condemn white supremacists for who they really are. Sure, he has said that he opposes violence, but for days it was clear that he did not want to reject the twisted and hateful beliefs that unite this disgusting movement.   For most of us they are a sick, racist subculture that we only encounter in history books or the movies. But for President Trump they are a part of his political base that he is sheepish about criticizing and whose connections run directly through White House adviser Steve Bannon, who ran the alt-right publication Breitbart.    The President of the United States should serve as an example for the rest of the country, but it appears that the rest of us have to serve as an example for him.    We should all join those that had the courage to stand up to these racists in Charlottesville, VA and do what President Trump should have done from the very beginning: condemn white supremacists and their hateful rhetoric.","status",NA,NA,1125,329,174,124,2,6,85,30

Here is our joint statement on Secretary Ryan Zinke's monument review report:   During Secretary Zinke’s review process, almost 3 million Americans — including thousands of New Mexicans – made their opinions clear. They believe our existing national monuments are vitally important to our economy, community and culture, and they don’t want them changed.    The Department of Interior’s report to the president completely ignores New Mexicans’ overwhelming support for the monuments, and doesn’t even offer specifics and meaningful data to back up their vague recommendations. It doesn’t come as a surprise that local voices were not taken into consideration, since Secretary Zinke declined to attend a town hall meeting on Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks and never even set foot in Rio Grande del Norte. It’s clear this report is a politically driven attempt by Washington to justify the administration’s extreme position that public lands should be privatized, leased or sold to the highest bidder.     In stark contrast to the rushed politically-driven review the Trump Administration holds in their hands, local communities, Tribes, lawmakers and previous administrations spent years working with local constituents and stakeholders to craft the most inclusive proposals possible. This administration took the opposite approach — they declined public hearings, made decisions behind closed doors, and kept their final recommendations hidden. What they have ended up with is a sloppy, inaccurate, and Washington-first work product devoid of local engagement.  And even now, New Mexicans — and all Americans — are in the dark about what is going to happen to these treasured places. The public deserves better than predetermined political conclusions based on hearsay and claims that are easily disproven if the Department had actually taken the time to listen to and work with local communities.    A decision to move forward with these recommendations would be both exceedingly unpopular and very likely illegal. We strongly urge the president to reject this sham report, honor the work by New Mexicans, and confirm that he will leave intact Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks, Rio Grande del Norte and all the other national monuments.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/MartinHeinrich/photos/a.10151407443904214.502995.137523189213/10155770955499214/?type=3",NA,383,57,76,37,2,1,11,31

This bill spends money we don’t have on tax breaks the rich don’t need. The legislation adds $1.4 trillion to the national debt, an average of $140 billion each year in increased deficits, further damaging our long-term fiscal situation. When tax revenues dry up because of this plan, Congress will be forced to make hard decisions about funding Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, public schools, our national labs, and our military.

President Trump has denied future generations the opportunity to learn about the past and explore the remote mesas and canyons that have inspired visitors and inhabitants, dating back thousands of years.  In the century plus since Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act into law, presidents from both political parties have used it to protect the places we all treasure and integral parts of who we are as Americans. Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante are unquestionably the types of places that the Antiquities Act was intended to protect for future generations. Dismantling protections for these landscapes sets a dangerous precedent that fuels an even larger campaign to attack many of our most treasured public lands across the nation.  I was proud to stand with southwestern tribes, including the Navajo Nation and Zuni Pueblo, who were part of an Inter-Tribal Coalition that called for monument protection for the sacred sites and irreplaceable cultural resources in Bears Ears. For the tribes who hold this land in deep reverence, Bears Ears National Monument and the thousands of historic and cultural sites within it serve as essential symbols of their rich history and continued perseverance.  In recent years, I’ve joined communities in New Mexico to welcome monument protections for Bears Ears and for two of the most spectacular culturally and ecologically significant places in our state—the Rio Grande del Norte and Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks. President Trump’s actions today threaten both of those community-driven monuments that permanently protected iconic landscapes, increased recreational access, and have proven to be major drivers for our local economies.  I’m confident that this shameful action will rightly face the same types of legal challenges as others pushed through by a White House hell-bent on appeasing a few extreme interests at the expense of the interests and values of the American people.  I urge the American people to continue making their voices heard to oppose this un-American action by the Trump Administration. We have a moral responsibility as a nation to our children and all future generations of Americans to protect and conserve our natural and cultural heritage.","status",NA,NA,287,118,117,6,8,3,98,210

They’ve abandoned working American families while recklessly blowing up the deficit in order to reward their wealthy friends and corporations with a tax cut that they do not need. When their tax plan is fully implemented, millions of middle-class families will face a tax increase.  Republicans talked and talked about simplicity. But with all the loopholes and giveaways for special interests, Republicans have made the tax code more complex. They said they would reduce the number of tax brackets, but they didn’t. And, at the last minute, they inserted additional tax breaks for the wealthy, cutting the top tax rate for individuals with incomes of $500,000 or more.  Republicans also used the tax bill to undercut health care coverage that New Mexicans count on, repealing a key provision of the Affordable Care Act that will result in 13 million Americans losing their health insurance over the next decade. And health insurance premiums paid by many others will increase by about 10 percent in most years.  This tax plan puts at risk the jobs of public school teachers, police officers, and firefighters by capping the deduction for property taxes and state and local income taxes. They even opened up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling.  The Republican plan fails to meet our country’s needs. It does not deliver tax relief to those who need it. It is also fiscally irresponsible, deepens inequality in the country, and it won’t do much to accelerate economic growth in New Mexico. I am extremely disappointed that my Republican colleagues jammed this legislation through both chambers without any input from Democrats, putting the interests of their donors and corporations ahead of those of the millions of families across this country who will be devastated by this tax plan.","status",NA,NA,530,429,158,5,36,6,169,395
