The Republican plan will make sure that healthcare coverage will only be available to a privileged few. For millions of hardworking Americans, the new plan would raise healthcare costs while providing less coverage. For our nation’s seniors, House Republicans are handing the reigns back to insurance companies to once again charge the elderly a higher rate for healthcare. For our nation’s children and working poor, House Republicans are cutting off Medicaid expansion, a vital lifeline for our most vulnerable populations to receive the most basic health care needs. For Americans with a pre-existing condition, House Republicans leave them vulnerable to insurance companies that wish to deny them coverage.  It is clear that Republicans are quickly trying to pass a poorly written bill without showing how many millions of Americans will be at risk of losing coverage under their replacement plan. The American people have made it clear, that they want quality healthcare that is both affordable and available when they need it.  If we want to provide stability for hardworking families, gutting current healthcare protections and raising premiums for lower quality healthcare coverage cannot be the route we take.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanMarcVeasey/photos/a.402538659831061.95088.394849110600016/1218173134934272/?type=3",NA,53,8,26,3,0,0,0,3

While the creation of the congressional district I currently represent may have resolved some of the court’s issues with the 2011 maps, this monumental decision will ensure that African-American and Hispanic voters in the DFW Metroplex and throughout Texas are accurately protected at the ballot box for years to come.

Time and time again, Republicans claim that their bill, “The American Health Care Act,” would ensure that many small business owners won’t have to close their doors and that individuals won’t affect their pocketbooks and will once again take charge of their health. Let me tell you, THAT is “fake news.” One resident from Dallas, Texas, Brandon, called to share his story on how this disastrous bill would affect him, his small business, and his family.  For years before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Brandon recalls his last and failed attempt to secure an individual health plan in 2008 as he was branded with a “pre-existing condition” because of an eye surgery he underwent years ago.  His wife, who was diagnosed with severe rheumatoid arthritis, has to take medication daily. Brandon shared that since enrolling into the marketplace in 2010 when the Affordable Care Act, he has been able to gain health coverage for himself and his wife. Most importantly, Brandon reaffirmed the promise of the Affordable Care Act, which allowed him to find an affordable plan that would allow him to keep his small business running and ensures that his wife can receive the medication she needs to live a normal life. Most importantly, Brandon confirmed that since enrolling during the last open enrollment, 2017 has been his best year of health and prescription coverage since the Affordable Care Act’s implementation. Brandon’s story is just one example of how millions of Americans HAVE taken control of their healthcare.

President Trump’s self-proclaimed master negotiation skills failed to deliver on the promises he made during the 2016 campaign. This ugly episode demonstrates that he is not a strong leader for Congressional Republicans. Seven years was more than enough time for different factions of the House Republican Caucus to create a viable replacement that actually delivers on their promises to lower costs and help Americans access better quality care. But instead, they tried to jam through a bill that alienated both moderate and right wing factions of their party. Luckily, their divided caucus allows the 20 million Americans who gained access to comprehensive health insurance under the Affordable Care Act to sleep peacefully, knowing that their health is not on the chopping block. #ProtectMyCare","status",NA,NA,183,30,21,20,7,0,0,1

The Office of Community Policing has proven itself to be a crucial resource by providing additional training for our officers, enacting reform in police departments across the country, and building trust in communities.

Many of the provisions included in the bill are a reflection of Democrats’ continued commitment to fight for all hardworking Americans while fighting back against poison pill amendments that are driven for partisan gain, including funding for President Trump’s unnecessary border wall and the defunding of Planned Parenthood.  One of the biggest wins for the American people is including funding that will continue to make it easier for students to achieve their higher education aspirations. This bill includes $22.5 billion for year-long funding to the Pell Grant program, which would boost the maximum Pell Grant award to nearly $6,000 per student. This boost in funding will ensure that students will now stay on track for graduation with less debt and guarantees that our future workforce has the tools they need to compete in the 21st-century global economy.   In addition to providing educational opportunities for our students, the bill also includes critical investments for a variety of federal agencies that President Trump threatened to eliminate in his budget plan. Democrats successfully secured $150 million for the National Endowment for the Arts and $150 million for the National Endowment for the Humanities, $34 billion for the National Institutes of Health and an advance appropriation of $445 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for fiscal year 2019. The continued funding of these different agencies will allow students nationwide to gain access to the arts and expose low-income children to high-quality public programming that prepares them for success in the future.  When House Democrats and Republicans meet again in September to negotiate the next fiscal year’s spending bill, I hope that the same bipartisan spirit persists. Our country can’t afford to play games with our government and our President shouldn’t encourage House Republicans to hold necessary spending bills hostage to fund his costly and ineffective border wall.","status",NA,NA,24,9,8,3,0,0,0,0

But with Trumpcare, Trump breaks his promise on healthcare and proves that House Republicans believe that partisan political gain is more important than the health of the communities they represent.   Trumpcare is a disaster for hardworking Americans who can expect to pay more for less coverage. It means that 24 million hard working Americans will be kicked off their health insurance plans. With the addition of the MacArthur and Upton amendments, Trumpcare becomes even more harmful to Americans. The amendment guts protections for individuals with preexisting conditions, removes requirements for coverage of essential healthcare benefits like maternity care, mental health treatment, and prescription drug coverage, and imposes an unlimited “age tax” on older Americans.    House Republicans cannot hide after voting in favor of this immoral and inhumane plan that will raise health costs for hardworking families.

This budget represents yet another revoked campaign promise and makes President Trump’s millionaire cronies wealthier at the expense of hardworking families. By eliminating job training programs that would boost wages and job opportunities across America, Trump is turning his back on the blue collar Americans that elected him to the presidency.   Trump’s plan cruelly ransacks critical safety nets put in place to help American families who struggle to make ends meet or need additional assistance during times of unemployment.  The 2018 budget calls for $190 billion in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and cuts the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grants by $15.6 billion. For the 33rd Congressional District of Texas, this budget means that over 52,000 DFW Metroplex households currently receiving SNAP benefits will not know when next meal will come.   A federal budget should be a testament to our nation’s values and priorities. President Trump apparently believes balancing the budget on the backs of hungry children, seniors, and our disabled is the American way. We must remind him that a strong national defense does not need to come at a price of leaving our most vulnerable out in the cold to fend for themselves. Our country is better served when it works in the interest of the people and not as an extension of Trump’s special interest mafia. #TrumpCuts  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/05/22/trumps-plans-to-cut-food-stamps-could-hit-his-supporters-hardest/?utm_term=.198ed3e1ce1c","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/05/22/trumps-plans-to-cut-food-stamps-could-hit-his-supporters-hardest/?utm_term=.198ed3e1ce1c","washingtonpost.com",34,19,11,1,3,1,5,22

By kicking 23 million Americans off their health insurance, shredding key protections, imposing a crushing age tax on our seniors, and ransacking Medicare, it is clear that any lip service paid to improving our nation’s healthcare system was just that – all talk.  Americans with pre-existing conditions will once again have to fight to obtain coverage. The return of high-risk pools will force sick Americans to pay outlandish premiums while imposing lifetime limits on the care they need. Additionally, House Republicans’ pitiful $8 billion in funding for high-risk pools is merely a drop in the bucket and fails to meaningfully offset the costs of insuring America’s less healthy.  Each page of the CBO score delivers bad news for the millions of Americans who have gained access to health insurance for the first time and for those who now have better coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act.

There is no mention of anything that would actually help the average working American afford quality health insurance. Similar to the drafting process House Republicans followed, GOP Senators worked on the bill behind closed doors and with no input from the industries they aim to reform or from patients or their advocates.     Don’t let the Senate bill fool you. This is still a bad bill. Kicking millions of Americans off health insurance, shredding key protections, cutting off access to crucial family planning, imposing a crushing age tax on our seniors, and ransacking Medicare doesn’t sound like the makings of a better healthcare system. Republicans in both chambers need to refocus their energy and take the time to craft legislation that provides quality care for a reasonable price.

The tax cuts will explode the deficit by $1.5 trillion which will translate to Republicans justifying devastating cuts to the programs Americans rely on to stay healthy and take care of themselves as they enter retirement. Medicaid, Medicare, SNAP, and Social Security will all be put on the chopping block in order to give away tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans.
