I cannot begin to express how blessed I am to have had the opportunity to serve. Now is the right time to step aside - I will not seek re-election. Here's my letter on this difficult decision:   When I first decided to run for Congress there were several things I wanted to achieve for the Commonwealth of Virginia and our nation. I had a strong passion for public service, a love of the law and the judicial system, and a deep appreciation for the people who call western and central Virginia home. These passions led me to serve on the Judiciary and Agriculture Committees throughout my time in the House, and have shaped my work on policies impacting the American people. I‚Äôve had the privilege to serve as Chairman of both of these committees, and I‚Äôve been proud to work on policies that have become law and advance fiscal conservatism, personal liberty, economic growth, and limited government.   For the past 25 years, it has been my honor to represent the Sixth Congressional District of Virginia. I cannot begin to express how blessed I am to have had the opportunity to serve and take part in the great experiment of self-government envisioned by our Founders. It has been a labor of love to work countless hours and travel endless miles on the roads of our District for a quarter of a century.  Every two years, Maryellen and I sat down to discuss whether to run again or not. When we discussed the 2018 election, the conversation ended a little differently than in past years. After much contemplation and prayer, we decided it was the right time for me to step aside and let someone else serve the Sixth District. I will not seek re-election. With my time as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee ending in December 2018, this is a natural stepping-off point and an opportunity to begin a new chapter of my career and spend more time with my family, particularly my granddaughters.  While I‚Äôm not running for re-election, my work in the 115th Congress is far from done. There is much that I hope we can accomplish in the next year, including: bolstering enforcement of our immigration laws and reforming the legal immigration system, simplifying the tax code in order to stimulate job growth and benefit families in the Sixth District, enacting criminal justice reform, repealing Obamacare, advancing protections of the freedoms and liberties enshrined in our Constitution, and, of course, continuing first-class constituent service for the citizens of the Sixth District. I look forward to working with the House Leadership, the Senate, and President Trump in bringing real conservative change to our country.  I extend my deepest thanks to the people of Virginia‚Äôs Sixth District who have placed their trust in me. It is truly you who are the highlight of my time in elected office. I‚Äôve had the good fortune of having an amazing staff team during my time in Congress ‚Äì both in my Sixth District offices as well as in the Judiciary and Agriculture Committees. They‚Äôve done excellent work, and I greatly value their commitment to serving the Sixth District and the American people. I‚Äôd also like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in Congress with whom I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work over the years. I genuinely appreciate your friendship and support. And finally, none of this would have been possible without the love and support of my wife, Maryellen, and our children, Bobby, Jen, and Jen‚Äôs husband, Matt. They have my enduring love and gratitude.  I look forward to what the next chapter brings.   Sincerely,  Bob","status",NA,NA,274,255,158,75,8,11,78,0

The House passed a bipartisan bill to reauthorize CHIP, but the Senate failed to take up the House bill or even pass one of their own so that we can sort out any differences in conference.   The Senate will have another chance to pass this important reauthorization before the end of the year, and I hope they act. Time is running out for Congress to reauthorize CHIP so that low-income children continue to have access to health coverage.","link","https://goodlatte.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1067","goodlatte.house.gov",29,45,1,0,0,0,0,11
