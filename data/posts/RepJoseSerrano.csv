Our Hispanic population’s needs and concerns have to be addressed; removing Spanish from our government’s website without having a suitable replacement ready is a clear indication that the Trump administration does not care about all Americans.   ---------------------------------   La página web de la Casa Blanca mantiene informados a nuestros ciudadanos sobre las acciones del Presidente, además de las iniciativas y la política pública de la rama ejecutiva.

The reports indicate that C.B.P. officials denied detainees access to legal representation, and coerced visa holders and Legal Permanent Residents into signing documents that would relinquish their legal immigration status. If the reports are accurate the actions undertaken by these officers undermine important provisions of our Constitution and the rule of law in the United States.   That is why we are asking these two offices to investigate these reports so that individuals that acted illegally can be held accountable, and to ensure that our immigration system is administered in a fair, impartial, and constitutional manner.

The City must be fully transparent with the findings of their investigations; notify all parents- regardless of language- about the situation; and provide a timeline for immediately addressing contaminated water systems or infrastructure.

The age-based tax credits also openly discriminate against older Americans who use health care more frequently. Americans who have pre-existing conditions will once again have insurance companies cut off access to care once they reach their lifetime insurance limit.

Beyer, I introduced the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act. This bill’s purpose is to designate places like schools, healthcare facilities, churches, and government offices as “Sensitive zones” that will be protected from #ICE raids. No one in the US should be fearful of taking their children to school, receiving medical care, or going to their place of worship. The #SensitiveLocationsAct creates common-sense limits to ensure that ICE agents perform their duties in a way that protects the safety, health, and civil rights of immigrants. It will also help preserve the security in our communities by helping ensure immigrants are not afraid to visit a court, report crimes and engage with law enforcement institutions and officials in other ways.     Hoy, junto a los Congresistas Espaillat, Bonamici, y Beyer, presenté el proyecto de ley “Protecting Sensitive Locations Act”. De convertirse en ley, el #SensitiveLocationsAct designaría a hospitales, escuelas, iglesias, y oficinas de gobierno como lugares sensitivos en donde agentes de #ICE no podrían llevar a cabo operativos. Nadie que viva en los Estados Unidos debería de sentir temor de ser deportado al llevar a sus hijos a la escuela, ir a facilidades médicas, o asistir a la iglesia. Este proyecto de ley crea limites bajo la ley para asegurar que los agentes de ICE conduzcan su trabajo de una manera que proteja la seguridad, la salud, y los derechos civiles de los inmigrantes. También ayudará a preservar la seguridad en nuestras comunidades al ayudar a asegurar que los inmigrantes no tengan miedo de visitar un tribunal, reportar crímenes y relacionarse con instituciones u oficiales de la ley de otras formas.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJoseSerrano/photos/a.300710048512.143284.273446508512/10154434654488513/?type=3",NA,37,3,7,0,0,0,0,0

As a senior appropriator on the Committee, this was a top priority for me, and I fought to ensure that New York was able to recoup these unprecedented costs.  This was a matter of fairness for New Yorkers- we shouldn’t have to bear the full cost of protecting the President and his family at Trump Tower– and with this funding, we won’t have to.","status",NA,NA,25,1,3,1,0,0,0,1

Unfortunately, local legislative measures being proposed in Puerto Rico - including one that ends dues deductions for public sector workers - threaten to weaken long held union protections in order to solve a problem that does not exist. Taking away workers’ rights to support the implementation of austerity measures is not the way to develop the island's economy to get out of the crisis. These changes will greatly hurt unions’ ability to organize, protect workers, and collectively bargain.  Unions were not the cause of the island's crisis, and they should not be used as a scapegoat. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________     La crisis fiscal de Puerto Rico no debe de ser utilizada para eliminarles derechos a los trabajadores. Lamentablemente algunas medidas legislativas que han sido presentadas en Puerto Rico – incluyendo una que elimina la deducción automática de las cuotas a empleados públicos unionados – amenazan con debilitar a las uniones para “resolver” un problema que no existe. Eliminar derechos a empleados públicos para continuar con la implementación de medidas de austeridad no es la manera adecuada de desarrollar la economía de la isla y terminar con la crisis. Estos cambios van a impactar negativamente la habilidad de las uniones de organizar y proteger a los trabajadores. Las uniones no tienen la culpa de la crisis fiscal así que no deberían de ser utilizados como chivo expiatorio.","status",NA,NA,27,12,10,0,0,0,1,2

Not only is this effort based on a distortion of facts that ignores our nation’s history, it threatens to undermine educational opportunity and represents an affront on our nation’s values. Inclusive and diverse higher education environments contribute to educational quality by guaranteeing students are exposed to a wide range of experiences, opinions and ideas. For generations, students that previously wouldn’t have had access to quality higher education have been able to achieve what their parents or grandparents couldn’t and/or enjoy the benefits of having a richer experience while at college.  This effort also undermines the very mission of the Civil Rights Division, and it is speaks volumes that career employees- dedicated to helping protect those historically marginalized- are being excluded from this effort.  I strongly oppose efforts to undo years of progress that we have made as a nation in expanding access to higher education to historically underrepresented groups.","status",NA,NA,11,0,3,0,0,0,0,0

This proposal is especially harmful to the Bronx- where immigrants from the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Nigeria, Ghana and elsewhere would be greatly harmed by these changes.
