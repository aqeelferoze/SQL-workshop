Unfortunately, this has been a common occurrence since the Affordable Care Act’s inception, and no state is feeling the pinch more than Arizona.  Prior to the flawed roll-out of the exchanges in 2013, Arizona had 24 health insurance companies offering plans in the individual market. But just last year, residents in Arizona’s most populous county, Maricopa, had only eight private insurers to choose from on the exchange.  As if that wasn’t bad enough, a few months ago, individuals all across Arizona received notifications that their insurance plans were no longer being offered, despite the current administration’s hollow assurances that they could keep their plans. Newly-stripped of their preferred health insurance, residents in 14 of Arizona’s 15 counties logged onto the Obamacare exchanges to shop for new plans, only to discover that instead of a vibrant marketplace of quality policies, they were left with only one insurer to choose from.  In fact, Pinal County in Arizona briefly held the unfortunate distinction as the only county in America without a single insurer willing to offer plans on its exchange. Not a single one.  Of the few plans that were ultimately made available to hardworking Arizonans on the exchange, the average policy came with a premium hike of nearly 50 percent. And with only one game in town, there was no shopping around for a better deal.  To help put this all in perspective, I’d like to compare the average cost of health insurance in Arizona to one of the most important purchases a family will ever make: owning a home. That’s right. Throughout most counties in Arizona, it’s now cheaper to put a roof over your family’s head than it is to pay your monthly health insurance premium under Obamacare.  In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, homeowners can expect to pay nearly $500 more per month on their health insurance than on their house.  In Pima County, home to Tucson, health insurance premiums run the average family $100 more a month than their mortgage.  And then there’s Pinal County, the third-largest in Arizona. According to the Arizona Department of Insurance, the average premium for a silver plan in Pinal County for a family of four is over $1,700. This is double the median monthly mortgage payment in the very same county.  Sadly, this situation isn’t unique to these, the three most populous counties in Arizona. In all fifteen of the state’s counties, premiums for a family of four dramatically exceed the median monthly mortgage.  It is unacceptable for the federal government to force families to expend upwards of $1,700 per month of their hard-earned income on a sub-standard product, without options or choice, only to then slap them with a draconian penalty when they can’t afford to comply with an untenable law. Arizona is ground zero for the structural failures that are plaguing insurance markets around the country. Insurance exchanges are on the verge of collapsing, premiums, deductibles, and out of pocket costs are skyrocketing, and our health care system is in desperate need of reform.  That is why I stand here today to introduce the Health Savings Account Expansion Act. The Health Savings Account Expansion Act goes a long way toward reforming our health care system by putting consumers back in charge of their own health care.  The bill provides individuals and families with the freedom to choose the health care that best meets their needs, and allows them to use their Health Savings Accounts on the medical products and services they value the most.  HSAs give consumers greater control over their health care dollars by providing them with a tax-advantaged savings option for their medical expenses. This means that the dollars they work so hard to save can grow over time, tax free, and be withdrawn, tax free, for qualified medical expenses.  The HSA Expansion Act strengthens this important tool by nearly tripling the arbitrarily low contribution limits, thus allowing for greater tax equity and more universal participation in HSAs.   The bill would then allow individuals to use these expanded HSAs to help cover the costs of their monthly health insurance premiums. This is a critically important feature, particularly for middle-class families whose income falls slightly above the qualified threshold for subsidies, but whose health insurance has become unaffordable.  In addition to further incentivizing prudent saving for health expenses, this legislation also repeals restrictions put in place by Obamacare on over-the-counter medications, while also reducing the penalty for withdrawing HSA funds for non-qualified purchases. These reforms will help streamline HSAs while also making them more user-friendly for consumers.  Arizonans are struggling. They’re struggling under the weight of a bureaucracy that is complicating their health care decisions, which are some of the most personal and important decisions that individuals make for themselves and their families.  If we hope to lift that burden off the backs of our constituents, we must recognize that the key to reforming our health care system is not more government intervention. Rather, it’s about allowing individuals the freedom to take back control of their own health care and incentivizing prudent decision making.  As the Senate looks to repeal this disastrous law and replace it with real reforms that will successfully lower health care costs and improve choice, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this legislation is included in those negotiations.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatorjeffflake/videos/10154067022326646/",NA,92,189,44,0,2,1,6,35

That promise has been broken in my home state of Arizona. That’s because Arizona falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, a circuit that is both oversized and overworked.   With a jurisdiction encompassing thirteen district courts spread over nine states and two U.S. territories, the 9th Circuit covers one in five Americans. It hears roughly 12,000 appeals each year – the next busiest circuit doesn’t even hear 9,000. And for the thousands of cases under its consideration, the average turnaround time exceeds 15 months.  If excessive delays weren’t bad enough, it turns out the 9th Circuit is overturned by the Supreme Court 77 percent of the time. So not only is the court excruciatingly slow, but in many instances, it’s simply wrong.  The court itself is unusually large. It has twenty-nine authorized judgeships. That’s 12 more than the next largest circuit. The 9th Circuit is so big that it can’t even rehear cases as a whole body, like every other federal appeals court. Instead, cases are reheard with “limited en banc” panels of 11 judges each. That means only a third of its judges are deciding the law for the entire court.  Of the states suffering under the weight of the 9th Circuit’s crushing backlog, Arizona shoulders a uniquely heavy burden. Per capita, Arizona has the busiest federal docket in the circuit. This puts Arizonans at the back of an already long line, just to get their day in court. And as the deluge of cases continues to fill the 9th Circuit’s docket, that line keeps getting longer and longer for folks in Arizona.   With problems like these, we’re left to ask: Is the 9th Circuit too big to succeed?  For Arizona, the answer is unquestionably yes.   Arizonans deserve better, and that’s why today, I’m reintroducing a bill to break up the 9th Circuit.   With the support of my colleague from Arizona, Senator John McCain, and our Governor Doug Ducey, I’ve authored the Judicial Administration and Improvement Act. This bill would create a new 12th Circuit by moving Arizona, as well as Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Washington out of the 9th Circuit. Doing so would create two smaller appellate courts where one dysfunctional court stood. All the while, establishing stronger local, regional, and cultural ties. This would help alleviate the 9th Circuit’s enormous caseload and ensure a more timely and accurate judicial process for both circuits.   Importantly, the bill would also free the new circuit from the 9th Circuit’s precedent. This means states like Arizona will be able to chart their own legal course, consistent with their local needs and traditions. A fair and functioning judiciary is one of the pillars of our democracy. Geography shouldn’t limit a citizen’s access to the courts.  The Judicial Administration and Improvement Act will right this wrong by restoring faith in our judicial system and securing the access to justice that Arizonans deserve.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatorjeffflake/videos/10154142535941646/",NA,158,341,18,9,0,2,3,69

Swift access to the courts is a foundational tenet of our justice system. But, for far too long, Arizonans and many other Americans have been denied this important constitutional right.  The reason? Our state falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. Composed of nine states and two U.S. territories, the oversized and overburdened 9th Circuit hears approximately 12,000 appeals each year—at least 30 percent more than the next most active circuit.  For these thousands of cases under consideration, the average turnaround time exceeds 15 months. With no slowing in the deluge of cases filling the docket, the path to justice keeps getting longer.  If excessive delays weren’t bad enough, 9th Circuit rulings are overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court 77 percent of the time. In some years, the 9th Circuit has had three times as many cases reversed as most circuits had before the Supreme Court in total.  An old joke in the Ninth Circuit bar captures the absurdity of this high reversal rate. It goes like this: A law clerk runs into a judge’s chambers holding a printout. “Good News!” he yells enthusiastically. “The Ninth Circuit affirmed you, Judge!” Disappointed, the judge replies, “Well, that may be, but I still think I’m right.”  So not only is the 9th Circuit punishingly slow—in the majority of its decisions before the Supreme Court, the long-awaited ruling is ultimately overturned.  The 9th Circuit is so large that, unlike any other circuit, it almost never sits as a single body, even for the most consequential cases. Whereas every other circuit regularly meets as one court to clarify inconsistencies in law, the 9th Circuit selects 11 of its 29 judges to set circuit-wide precedent.  That means only a third of its judges are deciding the law for the whole court.  With problems like these, is the 9th Circuit too big to properly administer justice? For Arizona, the answer is unquestionably yes.  Arizonans deserve a more efficient circuit court to get cases heard rather than having justice delayed under the heavily encumbered circuit.  In short, Arizonans are waiting too long for justice, and for no other reason than having the geographic and historical misfortune of falling under the overworked 9th Circuit. Arizonans deserve better, and that’s why we’re taking action.  Article I of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to create federal courts “inferior” to the Supreme Court. Congress has exercised this authority before to establish, arrange, and—yes—even rearrange courts. For example, Congress created a new 10th Circuit from the 8th Circuit’s midwestern states and a new 11th Circuit from the 5th Circuit’s eastern-most states.  Through cooperation with and input from those affected, we’ve put together a bill that would allow this historical practice to continue. Our Judicial Administration and Improvement Act, introduced the other week, would allow Congress to invoke its authority under Article I of the U.S. Constitution to create a new 12th Circuit from the 9th  Circuit’s mountain states and the Pacific Northwest.  By bringing Arizona, Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Washington together under a 12th “Mountain Circuit,” we will alleviate the 9th  Circuit’s enormous caseload and create two smaller appellate courts; where a single, dysfunctional court stood before, we will establish a stronger one—and with stronger local, regional, and cultural ties.  A fair and functioning judiciary is one of the pillars upon which our democracy rests. When we see that pillar begin to erode, elected officials have a responsibility to act. That’s what we’re doing.  The Judicial Administration and Improvement Act will shore up our judiciary and restore confidence in our courts while securing the access to justice that Arizonans deserve.","link","http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2017/02/21/our-turn-why-arizona-need-move-out-9th-circuit/97863740/","azcentral.com",125,231,22,5,3,2,0,106

Unfortunately, onerous regulations are making it harder for ranchers to stay in business.  I continue to hear from land users about the federal government’s general lack of coordination and cooperation with local stakeholders. For ranchers, a top concern is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s mishandling of the Mexican gray wolf recovery effort.  Species management is always a delicate balancing act, and it requires extensive consultation with the stakeholders that are most affected by changes to local ecosystems.  To address the declining numbers of Mexican gray wolves in Arizona and New Mexico, the wolf was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1976. The Fish and Wildlife Service went on to finalize the Mexican Gray Wolf Recovery Plan to return viable populations back to the wolf’s historic range.  This plan set a recovery goal of 100 wolves, a target that was exceeded in 2014. However, instead of celebrating the recovery plan’s success by delisting the wolf and returning management to the states, the federal government decided to move the goal posts.  It continues to manage the Mexican gray wolf under onerous ESA requirements, harming ranchers and other rural Arizona stakeholders in the process.  This is a case study in what’s wrong with the Endangered Species Act. I agree that we should ensure viable species populations, but the law was never intended for species to be listed in perpetuity.  Since the Endangered Species Act was signed into law, more than 2,000 species have been listed as threatened or endangered. Yet in more than 40 years, less than one percent of these species have ever been removed from the list.  This isn’t because of the law’s failure to recover species, rather, it’s due to a bureaucratic reluctance to return species management to the states.  To establish a realistic path forward to delist the Mexican gray wolf that respects Arizona property owners, I introduced the Mexican Gray Wolf Recovery Plan Act. This legislation will require the Fish and Wildlife Service to work with state and local stakeholders in drafting an updated recovery plan that doesn’t adversely impact livestock, wild game, or recreation.  The bill would reflect the reality that 90 percent of the wolf’s historic range is in Mexico, meaning that states like Arizona won’t be forced to shoulder an unfair burden of the recovery effort.  And since this legislation deals with wolves, I figured it should have some teeth.  Under the bill, achieving the recovery goal would trigger an automatic delisting, returning management of Mexican gray wolves to the states. If the Fish and Wildlife Service doesn’t comply with the updated recovery plan, state wildlife agencies would be empowered to assume management of wolf populations in accordance with the Endangered Species Act.  Holding the Fish and Wildlife Service accountable is critically important for rural Arizona, especially at a time when the federal government is challenging the fundamental principle of federalism with respect to species management throughout the West.  While most ranchers may not think of the Tenth Amendment or appellate courts when they spot a wolf on the edge of their family’s property, it turns out that the structure of our federal judiciary could not be more important for protecting rural Arizona’s way of life.  Arizona is located in the notoriously large and unwieldy U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Along with its crushing case backlog, the San Francisco-based court has a reputation for decisions that are decidedly outside of the legal mainstream, leading it to be overturned by the Supreme Court more than any other federal circuit.  To provide Arizona with the same legal recourse enjoyed by other states in the event of executive overreach, such as the Fish and Wildlife Service’s unlawful release of captive-born wolves in New Mexico, I introduced legislation to break up the Ninth Circuit.  The Judicial Administration and Improvement Act will create a new Twelfth Circuit by moving Arizona, Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Washington out of the Ninth Circuit. Doing so would establish stronger local, regional, and cultural ties, while also ensuring a more timely and accurate judicial process for both circuits.  Rural Arizonans have put up with overreaching executive agencies and a complicit judiciary for long enough. These two bills will ease bureaucratic burdens and restore faith in our judicial system.","link","http://kdminer.com/news/2017/feb/27/column-sen-jeff-flake-mexican-gray-wolf-and-blue-j/","kdminer.com",60,155,27,4,0,0,2,91

When people think of the Old West, they often picture a Stetson-wearing lawman sitting astride his horse, keeping watch over his community. For generations of residents in southwestern Arizona, that lawman was Yuma County Sheriff Ralph Ogden.  With his towering frame and trademark mustache, Sheriff Ogden looked every bit the part. But despite his imposing physical presence, Sheriff Ogden was a kind, compassionate man, beloved by his deputies and celebrated by his community.  After four years of distinguished service in the United States Marine Corps, Ralph Ogden began his 42 year law enforcement career as a dispatcher and jailer in Parker, Arizona. A dedicated public servant, he would eventually serve as Chief Deputy for 12 years. Ralph would go on to be elected to five consecutive terms as Sheriff, with his 20 year tenure the longest in Yuma County history.    Sheriff Ogden always understood the importance of getting to know the community he served, and encouraged his employees to get involved in charities, religious groups, and service organizations. He valued teamwork, and recognized that no one can succeed on their own. This philosophy of always having each other’s back was something he carried with him throughout his time with the Sheriff’s Office, and it was reflected in the way he treated those around him.  Sheriff Ogden was known to write personal birthday and anniversary cards for each of his employees, just to show that he valued their service and friendship, and that they were important to him. When asked about the benefits of serving in law enforcement, Sheriff Ogden said that when you go home tired and beat after a long day, you sleep well knowing you did some good.  Sheriff Ralph Ogden did a lot of good, and I know he is resting well.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatorjeffflake/videos/10154213831231646/",NA,48,35,20,6,0,0,9,0

First, Judge Gorsuch, let me congratulate you on your nomination. I’m sure that you have family and friends here with you today, and I know they must be very proud of you.  One of the most consequential decisions a president makes is who they select to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court.   It’s a lifetime appointment, which means that a man or woman selected to sit on our nation’s highest court will interpret our laws for decades to come.  Justice Antonin Scalia demonstrated just how much one justice can shift the gravity of the court.  No justice in recent memory has so fundamentally influenced the trajectory of the Supreme Court or our approach to reading the law.  He did this with his unshakable commitment to an originalist interpretation of the Constitution and a textualist approach to statutes.   Justice Scalia’s passing marked a watershed moment for the future of our judiciary.  As one law professor remarked, “What lets the legal system survive is that people in power, such as Scalia, believe that the system controls their individual judgments. What will happen to the law without Justice Scalia to believe in it?”  Fortunately, President Trump nominated a jurist who also believes in the rule of law.  In meeting with Judge Gorsuch and learning about his judicial philosophy, I was impressed by his respect for the law and commitment to service.  I’ve been particularly struck by his recognition that “it is for Congress, not the courts, to write new law,” and that a justice should make decisions based on what the law demands, not an outcome he or she desires.  As Judge Gorsuch once said, “A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge.”  Judge Gorsuch is an accomplished, mainstream jurist with a judicial philosophy worthy of Justice Scalia’s seat. Judge Gorsuch is an originalist. He does not read words that are not there, or infer an understanding that did not exist at the time of the Framers.   He has repeatedly reminded us that—while we as legislators may appeal to our moral convictions in shaping the law—judges in a democratic society should not decide cases based upon their own moral convictions or policy preferences.   With Judge Gorsuch, we can be confident that he will read the law as written, and not legislate from the bench.  Judge Gorsuch also understands the separation of powers.  He has cautioned against “governmental encroachment on the people’s liberties,” which could occur should the political majorities of the legislative and executive branches be permitted to decide cases, and the politically unresponsive judiciary branch be allowed to create or execute policies.   For my part, I’m excited to confirm a justice who reveres the separation of powers as one of the central principles of our Constitution.  Judge Gorsuch has also demonstrated support for religious freedom.    Our country has always valued the right of individuals to practice their faith as they please.  He once wrote that our religious freedom statute, “doesn’t just apply to protect popular religious beliefs: it does perhaps its most important work in protecting unpopular religious beliefs, vindicating this nation’s long-held aspiration to serve as a refuge of religious tolerance.”  The Supreme Court later agreed with Judge Gorsuch that it is the government’s job to protect an individual’s ability to practice their religion, not to instruct them on how to practice their religion.   Finally, as an Arizonan, I’m very proud of the fact that Judge Gorsuch is a fellow Westerner.   Where you’re from influences your understanding of cultural and regional sensitivities, and the current makeup of the Supreme Court has an unmistakable lack of geographic diversity.  Of the eight current Justices, five of them were born in New York or New Jersey.  The Supreme Court needs Western perspective, and fortunately, Judge Gorsuch fits the bill.  When I met with Judge Gorsuch last month, we discussed our respective Western backgrounds.   I told him about my days growing up on a cattle ranch in rural Arizona, and he told me that his heart has always been in the American West.   You learn a lot about a person by how they spend time with their friends and family, and there’s no mistaking it with Judge Gorsuch: he’s a Westerner through and through. What makes Judge Gorsuch a true Westerner is more than just where he lives or what his personal interests are.   In the West we pride ourselves on being free people, with strong communities, and limited government.   Judge Gorsuch’s jurisprudence reflects what every Westerner knows to be true: an intrusive federal government can interfere with the sovereign power of Western states to govern themselves.

While the chair was left vacant by the passing of renowned Justice Antonin Scalia, it also symbolizes a stark reality: the absence of a Westerner on the court.   Seven of the Supreme Court’s justices hail from the concrete jungles of New York and New Jersey, or the costal enclaves of California, and all are products of the Ivy League. Not a single one of them can call the West’s windswept mesas, rugged mountains, or expansive rangelands home.  In a country that prides itself on representative government, it would seem that Westerners – folks like you and me – should have a western voice on our highest court.  It hasn’t always been this way. As recently as a decade ago, Arizona’s very own Sandra Day O’Connor served with distinction as an associate justice.  As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and more importantly as an Arizonan, I cannot overstate the importance of confirming a fellow Westerner to the Supreme Court. We need a justice who understands our cultural and regional sensibilities, and who will restore a western perspective to a court desperately lacking in geographic diversity.  Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, fits the bill.  When I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Gorsuch in my office last month, we discussed our respective western roots. I reminisced about my days growing up on a cattle ranch in northern Arizona, and he confided that his heart has always been in the American West.  You can learn a lot about a person from how they like to spend their free time, and on this count there’s no mistaking it with Judge Gorsuch: he’s a Westerner through and through.  You’re just as likely to run into Neil at the rodeo with his daughters or fly-fishing with his buddies as you are to catch him at a staid legal conference. I should note that he holds degrees from Columbia, Harvard, and Oxford – but I won’t hold it against him.  Judge Gorsuch’s Western values are also evident in his career choices, which have reflected the same service ethos as one of Arizona’s favorite sons.  Much like the late Senator Barry Goldwater, Judge Gorsuch left behind the comforts of a lucrative private sector career for life as a public servant. As a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, he’s been a staunch defender of religious liberty and the constitutional separation of powers.  Like millions of his fellow Westerners, Judge Gorsuch shares a healthy skepticism of our excessively intrusive and heavy-handed federal bureaucracy. He recognizes how federal regulations interfere with the sovereign rights of Western states to govern themselves – whether it’s the previous administration’s Clean Power Plan, its ozone rules, or even management of the Mexican gray wolf.  In numerous opinions, Judge Gorsuch’s Western disposition has shone through, giving voice to many of the frustrations experienced by folks like us in Arizona. From his criticism of the overly assertive D.C. court’s compulsion to intervene from 2,000 miles away, to his navigation of complex split-estate property rights litigation, he speaks our language.  If confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would already bring generational and religious diversity to the court. But perhaps more than anything, it would be his Western perspective that would most enrich the debate in the years to come.  This week the Senate Judiciary Committee held its confirmation hearings for Judge Gorsuch. Just as I did at the hearings, and as I have repeatedly done from the Senate floor, I will continue to make the case to my colleagues that he is an accomplished, mainstream jurist who deserves fair consideration and an up-or-down vote.  Judge Gorsuch should be confirmed overwhelmingly, and I am confident that he will be. I look forward to casting my vote to finally put a Westerner back on the Supreme Court.","link","https://www.cvbugle.com/news/2017/mar/21/commentary-judge-gorsuch-would-bring-much-needed-w/","cvbugle.com",134,249,21,13,3,0,2,100

Like an immovable pillar weathering a storm, Gorsuch held firm, exhibiting the steady confidence of a judge who knows the law.  Judge Gorsuch characterized the foundation of his jurisprudence as a commitment to apply the law fairly and equally to all litigants, irrespective of class, color, or creed. Big or small, popular or unpopular, powerful or powerless, Judge Gorsuch promised to render judgments based off of the facts of the case and the law. Nothing else.  I was particularly impressed by Judge Gorsuch’s humble respect for the law and his reverence for the role of a judge as an apolitical public servant. He was fiercely protective of his judicial impartiality, and I was glad to see him refuse to answer questions that could jeopardize his ability to serve fairly as a justice in future cases.    Throughout the hearings, many on the other side of the aisle tried to attack his character, accusing Judge Gorsuch of being a corporate shill who never looks out for “the little guy.” Nothing could be further from the truth.  Another line of attack was that Judge Gorsuch would simply side with the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed justices, forming majorities based on party affiliation rather than the facts and the law. This was an attempt to distract from Judge Gorsuch’s remarkable record of respect and cooperation with judges appointed by presidents of both parties.         During his decade-long tenure on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Gorsuch participated in more than 2,700 appeals, comprising some of the most difficult cases across six states. Of those cases, 97 percent of them were decided unanimously, and Judge Gorsuch was in the majority 99 percent of the time. This is no small feat, and it is a testament to Judge Gorsuch’s ability to consider other points of view and seek out consensus when possible.    In the weeks since his nomination, I’ve spoken at length on the Senate floor about Judge Gorsuch’s qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court.  I’ve recognized him as a champion of religious liberty, a defender of the separation of powers, and a Westerner who will bring some much-needed geographic diversity and regional perspective to the court.   But more than anything, I’ve highlighted the fact that Judge Gorsuch is an accomplished, mainstream jurist who should be confirmed overwhelmingly to the Supreme Court.  There was a time when the Senate didn’t even require hearings for Supreme Court nominees, and as recently as the 1990s, nominees were routinely confirmed with near-universal, bipartisan support. Even President Obama’s two Supreme Court nominees were recognized for their ability to do the job and confirmed without incident.  Unfortunately, it appears that Judge Gorsuch will not be afforded the same courtesy and respect.  The Senate Democrats’ decision to filibuster Judge Gorsuch is a sad commentary on this institution, and reflects the breakdown in comity that once characterized this body. I hope they change their mind. We need this good man on the court.","link","http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2017/03/24/jeff-flake-neil-gorsuch-filibuster/99600950/","azcentral.com",130,361,21,17,7,0,5,149

And the federal government has no better partners than local law enforcement agencies from border communities, like those in my home state of Arizona.  These officers and deputies serve on the front lines, providing critical assistance to federal agencies’ missions. Unfortunately, these efforts are expensive and the locals end up picking up part of the tab. For example, local law enforcement agencies hold those facing immigration violations at county-operated jails. And they provide medical care for undocumented inmates while in custody. In providing these services, Arizona’s counties have incurred more than $310 million in costs associated with criminal undocumented immigrants since 2009. Despite these enormous costs, the federal government has left many local jurisdictions to shoulder the burdens of illegal immigration on their own.      This is particularly frustrating when so many of our local law enforcement agencies are already struggling to carry out basic duties on overstretched budgets. I hope we all look forward to a time when we have the appropriate resources for securing the border, the means for those seeking to fill the needs of our economy to enter legally, a remedy for those that are here illegally, and a way for employers to ensure legal hires. These critical steps toward solving our immigration problems will require Congress to act.  However, in the meantime, we can’t continue to allow the federal government to pass off immigration responsibilities onto cash-strapped local agencies. That’s why I rise today to introduce a bill to reauthorize and reform the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, better known as SCAAP. The bill is cosponsored by my friend and colleague from Arizona, Senator John McCain, and supported by the Arizona Sheriffs Association.  SCAAP is a federal program that reimburses state, local, and tribal law enforcement for the costs associated with incarcerating and caring for criminal undocumented immigrants while in custody. To ensure that local law enforcement receives sufficient reimbursement under SCAAP, my bill would make some commonsense reforms to the program. The bill would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to reauthorize SCAAP through Fiscal Year 2021.  Reauthorizing the program will provide law enforcement agencies in Arizona and across the country with the certainty that any costs incurred from incarcerating criminal immigrants will be covered by federal reimbursements. Our state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies are committed to partnering with the federal government on immigration enforcement. But that partnership can’t succeed unless the federal government provides the necessary reimbursements for those services.  As Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels stated, “Arizona’s counties continue to struggle under the fiscal strain of anemic growth in rural areas and cost-shifts from the State of Arizona. Housing criminal aliens without federal assistance diverts needed resources away from our communities’ public safety priorities.”     The SCAAP program is the foundation of the immigration partnership between local law enforcement and the federal government and for keeping our communities safe. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation to reauthorize and reform the SCAAP program.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatorjeffflake/videos/10154282198021646/",NA,46,158,13,4,0,1,0,39

They’ve stormed beaches at Normandy and Iwo Jima, patrolled the jungles of Vietnam, and fought repression and terror in the Middle East.  We are proud to call them Arizonans.  When these men and women return home from conflicts abroad, the transition back to civilian life can sometimes mark the beginning of a new battle to overcome the mental and physical tolls of combat. With the support of friends and family members, and the tireless work of Veterans Service Organizations, many veterans surmount these challenges.  Some veterans who lack support systems after leaving the military may struggle to confront obstacles on their own. For some, this means coming into contact with the criminal justice system.  While there is no justification for criminal behavior, it is important to recognize when certain actions may be symptomatic of the harrowing experiences a veteran has endured during service.  Many veterans have experienced multiple deployments, which can increase the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. It is not uncommon for this to lead to substance abuse, and in some cases, run-ins with the law.  According to a report by the Government Accountability Office, veterans who go through the justice system have high rates of mental illness, substance abuse, homelessness and other health-related issues.The GAO found that veterans often do not seek mental health treatment due to concerns over career prospects, lack of understanding or awareness, and logistical challenges in accessing care.  The combination of mental health disorders and substance abuse places veterans at higher risk of incarceration, and our criminal justice system does not provide the types of treatments that would actually address a veteran’s underlying service-connected issues.  The result is a vicious cycle: Service-connected mental illness is overcriminalized, incarcerated veterans are under-treated, and recidivism rates continue to grow.  To remedy the absence of veteran-specific treatment in our criminal justice system, the Department of Veterans Affairs created the Veterans Justice Outreach program in 2009. The program established diversionary courts that remove veterans from the regular criminal justice process and provide tailored treatments to address underlying issues such as post-traumatic stress and substance abuse.  Veterans treatment courts have a track record of preventing initial incarceration and reducing recidivism rates among the veteran population. Each court partners with a local VA medical center and hires Veterans Justice Outreach (VJO) specialists to link veterans to critical veterans court services. This is particularly important for those veterans who may not be aware of the resources available to them.  There are 293 VJO specialists in 365 veterans treatment courts nationwide. These specialists identify veterans in jails and local courts, assess their health status and help to develop a rehabilitation treatment program specific to each veteran’s needs.  However, the VA lacks a sufficient number of VJO specialists, which has led to an underuse of available veterans court services and an inability to reach veterans in need of treatment.  According to VA data, the demand for VJO specialists is outpacing the program’s ability to serve all potentially eligible veterans. Without sufficient specialists, additional veterans treatment courts cannot be established and existing courts will be less effective.  To ensure that our veterans receive swift and appropriate access to justice, we have worked together to craft the Veterans Treatment Court Improvement Act. This legislation, set to be introduced in the U.S. Senate this month, will provide 50 additional VJO specialists for new and understaffed veterans treatment courts.  Veterans treatment courts are an important part of the support system our veterans have earned with their service. By increasing the number of dedicated specialists at these facilities, fewer veterans will get lost in the criminal justice system and go without treatment.","link","http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2017/04/19/veterans-treatment-court-flake-brnovich/100187994/?hootPostID=d35fd52d237637f470fc75b3e959d252","azcentral.com",43,64,8,4,1,1,1,12

Police Week is a good time for reflection and remembrance; it is a time to honor those who serve and protect us. While we honor our dedicated law enforcement officers this week, I want to specifically recognize those fallen officers who have given the ultimate sacrifice—their lives—for our safety.    In Arizona, we lost three officers this year: Officer Leander Frank of the Navajo Nation Police Department; Officer David Van Glasser of the Phoenix Police Department; and Officer Darrin Reed of the Show Low Police Department.    Today we honor the memory of these fallen heroes, and pledge to never forget their sacrifice. While the work we do in Congress pales in comparison to the service of these brave men and women, it’s my privilege to sponsor several pieces of legislation to support our law enforcement officers.   I’ve joined Senator Hatch to introduce the Rapid DNA Act; a bill to give state and local law enforcement agencies a way to upload a suspect’s DNA analysis to the federal offender database for immediate identification. This immediate cross-hit within the federal system will help officers at the local level process criminals faster and more accurately.     I’ve also teamed with Senator Feinstein to introduce the bipartisan Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act. That legislation criminalizes the failure to report to law enforcement incidences of suspected child abuse in amateur athletics. In addition to helping prevent sexual abuse crimes, this bill will aid state and local law enforcement investigating allegations of child sexual abuse by providing them with more information faster.    I have also supported Senator Cornyn’s American Law Enforcement Heroes Act. That bill affirms a well-established practice of hiring veterans at the local level to serve as new law enforcement officers.    Together, these bills will enhance law enforcement investigations and encourage better hiring practices for new law enforcement jobs.    I also want to recognize those local police officers and sheriffs in Arizona and along the border who are serving on the front lines of immigration enforcement. These men and women put their lives on the line each time they head out on patrol, and for them, immigration policy is not a hypothetical exercise. But despite the critical role these entities play in assisting their federal partners with immigration enforcement, current federal policy leaves them exposed to the threat of costly litigation. That’s because third-party groups that oppose detention have threatened local agencies that choose to comply with valid detainer requests with lawsuits. Using punitive legal action to punish law enforcement for good-faith efforts to keep people safe is wrong. So when a group of Arizona sheriffs came to me for help, I immediately got to work on a solution.    With their guidance, we drafted a bill requiring the Department of Homeland Security to protect state and local law enforcement entities from lawsuits that uphold valid detainer requests from ICE.   This solution will enable officers to fulfill their law enforcement responsibilities without second-guessing whether or not to keep potentially dangerous criminal aliens in custody. And it’s a recognition that local law enforcement shouldn’t be left to shoulder the burden of Washington’s failure to secure our borders and implement a workable enforcement policy. It’s been a privilege to work on this effort with the Arizona Sheriffs Association, the Western States Sheriffs' Association, the Southwest Border Sheriff's Coalition, and the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition. I especially want to thank Sheriff Mascher of Yavapai County, Sheriff Dannels of Cochise County, Sheriff Wilmot of Yuma County, and Sheriff Clark of Navajo County for their work on this bill.   To many, Police Week is an annual opportunity to recognize the service of the many selfless men and women in local law enforcement. But it should also serve as a solemn reminder of the risks they take and the sacrifices they make day-in and day-out. It is for this that they have my support, my respect, and my thanks and they have it year-round.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatorjeffflake/videos/10154415964611646/",NA,70,76,14,11,0,0,0,12

Washington, D.C. 20530   Dear Attorney General Sessions:  I write today concerning Operation Streamline and the impact it has had on my home state of Arizona.  As you know, the intent of Operation Streamline was to reduce border-crossing recidivism by expeditiously prosecuting those entering or reentering illegally under a “zero tolerance” approach.  Operation Streamline has largely been credited with helping achieve effective control in the Border Patrol Yuma Sector, which saw a 95 percent decrease in apprehensions after implementing the program.  It was because of policies like Operation Streamline that the Yuma Sun noted, “the Yuma Sector’s border with Mexico has gone from being one of the busiest and most dangerous in the nation to one of the most secure.”  Unfortunately, despite its effectiveness, the previous administration sought to water down its deterrent effect by shifting its policy to targeting only first-time illegal border crossers whom had a known criminal history or were otherwise a threat to public safety.  I thank you for your recent visit to Arizona and for the priority you’ve placed on working to achieve effective border security.  At your Senate Judiciary confirmation hearing, when asked of your interest in Operation Streamline, you stated, “It seems to me that we should examine the successes and see if they can’t be replicated throughout the border.”  Therefore, I encourage you to consider the reimplementation of Operation Streamline under its original intent where possible.  In an effort to encourage the success of this program, I would like to ask the following questions:  1. Do you believe Operation Streamline and the ability to prosecute first-time illegal border crossers is an effective tool when it comes to deterring and combatting illegal border crossings?  2. Do you plan to continue implementing Operation Streamline along the Southern Border?  3. Do you anticipate returning Operation Streamline to its original intent or are there other ways to improve the program’s effectiveness?  I thank you for your attention to this important issue. I look forward to your response and working with you on this important issue. As always, I ask that this matter be handled in strict accordance with all applicable agency rules, regulations, and ethical guidelines.  Sincerely,   JEFF FLAKE United States Senator","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatorjeffflake/videos/10154518313206646/",NA,146,213,26,9,3,2,2,142

From the Founding of our country, religious believers have played a central role in our government. The Declaration of Independence was signed by a Presbyterian Minister, John Witherspoon, and Charles Carroll, the cousin of our country’s first Catholic bishop.    The importance of religious participation was in the air the Founders breathed and the benefits religious believers of all backgrounds contributed to the common good was understood by the Framers of the Constitution. That’s why they made it clear in Article VI of the Constitution that no public officers could be subject to a “religious test.”  This new country wouldn’t be a country for Anglicans or for Congregationalists or for Quakers. It would be a country for all Americans of all faiths, committed to the Constitution and the common good.   Unfortunately, the Religious Test Clause is no longer just the subject of history lessons.   During this Congress there have been a number of cases when my friends in the minority have seemed to ask nominees about their substantive religious beliefs. I find this particularly troublesome because, as a Mormon, I am a member of a faith that, while it is growing rapidly, still counts fewer adherents than many other religions.   It is religious liberty – espoused in constitutional provisions like Article Six and the First Amendment – that has allowed my faith, despite a difficult history, to flourish in the United States.  And it is religious liberty that is threatened when we seem to evaluate the fitness of nominees for high office on religious orthodoxy.  The most recent example of this was the recent Judiciary Committee nomination hearing of Professor Amy Coney Barrett of the Notre Dame Law School. During that hearing she was asked repeatedly about her Catholic faith, and faced what bordered on ridicule when she repeatedly stated that she would perform her judicial duties without interference from the doctrines of the Catholic faith.  It was stated by one questioner “The dogma lives loudly within you and that is a concern.” What does that statement mean, in this context, if not to question Professor Barrett’s judicial fitness based on her religious beliefs.   Liberal groups have been relentless in their opposition to Professor Barrett, mischaracterizing her record to paint her as some fringe ideologue, waiting to take orders from the Pope or others in clergy on how to decide cases. Just last week the New York Times ran a 1500 word story on where Professor Barrett worships. It turns out that, apart from her parish church, Professor Barrett has been part of an ecumenical “charismatic” community. I should note that “charismatic” Christianity is gaining ground among Latinos in the United States and throughout Latin America. It is a vibrant—and very diverse—minority religious tradition.  According to the Times, Prof. Barrett should have disclosed her participation in this charismatic community to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Professor Barrett’s former professor and colleague, Professor Cathy Kaveny of Boston College, went so far as to ask, “[Nominees] have to disclose everything from the Elks Club to the alumni associations we belong to — why didn’t she disclose this?”   I’m no law professor, but I can tell her why: because in the United States of America it doesn’t matter where you worship when you are being considered for a federal office. And that is as it should be.  The Judiciary Committee does not require disclosure of religious affiliation and I trust my colleagues would join me in strenuously objecting if it did.  Mr. President, it’s ironic that a Notre Dame professor is the target of this kind of animus. Notre Dame, of course, has long been at the forefront of fighting prejudice in this country.  Early in its years, Notre Dame helped rid America of the scourge of slavery. Many artists have rendered Notre Dame Professor, Father William Corby, giving the Irish Brigade general absolution during the Battle of Gettysburg. The school then faced down the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s.  At a time when a large number of white men in Indiana were members of the Klan, Notre Dame students made it clear that the Klan’s brand of nativist, anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic hate was not welcome in South Bend.  Four decades later, Notre Dame’s President, Father Ted Hesburgh, received a call about a rally at Soldier Field being organized by Dr. Martin Luther King. Hesburgh was told that Mayor Daley and Cardinal Cody had declined invitations to appear at the civil rights rally and the organizers wondered if he would be willing to appear. In response Hesburgh drove to Chicago, locked hands with Dr. King, and sang “We Shall Overcome.”   Whether it is slavery, nativism, or Jim Crow, Notre Dame has stood up to it and has triumphed.  In that same tradition, I am confident that Professor Barrett is up to that task.  What is remarkable is that I need to say this in 2017, it bears repeating: a Roman Catholic can be a faithful steward of the law. So can an Episcopalian, so can a Mormon, so can a Muslim, and so can an atheist.   We in the Senate give the president advice and consent on judicial nominations. We therefore should examine their jurisprudential views and their qualifications. We must not examine their relationships with the Almighty.  I sincerely hope that this body will step back from that dangerous ledge and evaluate Professor Barrett based on her impeccable qualifications - not where she attends church.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatorjeffflake/videos/10154790953356646/",NA,484,598,119,57,14,13,7,262

This bill offers solutions to the serious problems facing us on border security, while at the same time addressing the need for a legislative solution to the issues faced by those children brought here through no fault of their own.  With respect to the border, this bill provides the $1.6 million in funding for border security measures that the President requested and the House has approved in a bipartisan vote.  As an Arizonan, I am more than familiar with the need to take steps to increase border security. In addition to the appropriate barriers that will aid in preventing illegal crossings, we need the access roads to actually get to the border. This bill addresses issues recently raised by the GAO with respect to border access roads and the use and maintenance of private roads by CBP.  The bill also aids law enforcement by ensuring the swift deportation of individuals determined to be members of violent gangs and drug cartels. I’d also like to thank Congresswoman Barbara Comstock for her leadership on this issue and her sponsorship of the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act.    With respect to those children brought here through no fault of their own, this bill takes a measure that has already earned bipartisan support in the House – the Recognizing America’s Children Act – that provides a solution for the DACA kids. These young immigrants were brought here as children and simply don’t know any other country. For all intents and purposes, these young people consider themselves Americans.  So, if we can protect these DACA recipients and provide solutions to better secure our borders at the same time – that’s a win-win.    The President and Congress both want to improve border security. We both want to respond to the threat of dangerous gangs and drug cartels. And we both want to arrive at a legislative solution for the rescission of the DACA program that benefits those who wish to continue contributing to their communities and the American dream.  This bill is the best way the thread the needle to deliver exactly what the President asked for, what the Congress wants, and what my constituents deserve.  These issues are far too important for us to delay acting on them.  To be clear, I’ll work with anyone and support any number of proposals to accomplish these goals.  I believe the straightforward approach of the Border Security and Deferred Action Recipient Relief Act is the best chance we’ve got to put a bill on the president’s desk.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatorjeffflake/videos/10154798039376646/",NA,327,502,66,25,5,10,8,161

What do the cute, mild-mannered pets have to do with federal tax policy?  Earlier this year, I issued an oversight report entitled “TAX RACKETS: Outlandish Loopholes to Lower Tax Liabilities,” demonstrating how clever accounting allows nearly anything imaginable to become a write-off, including alpacas. To illustrate the point, the report outlined how local and federal tax bills can be sheared by claiming the exotic pets as livestock to turn backyards into barnyards.  That’s when the fur started to fly.  Alpaca owners associations that once brazenly touted the tax fleece as a key selling point of the animals now feigned outrage at the suggestion. The association tried to pull the wool over the eyes of taxpayers by retaining a professional PR consultant and launched a media campaign inundating my office and others with phone calls, social media messages, and letters and photos of alpacas.  If this mere mention of a tax break costing about $10 million annually enjoyed by relatively few elicited such an outmeasured and aggressive response, imagine the backlash to attempts to actually eliminate tax preferences benefiting powerful corporate and special interests to the tune of billions of dollars.  There are more than 200 loopholes buried throughout the tax code that collectively cost $1.23 trillion annually. This exceeds the total amount spent annually by the federal government for all discretionary programs, which includes defense, education, transportation, foreign aid and the environment.  These exemptions increase the bill for the average taxpayer and complicate the tax code, leading most individuals to hire a professional to prepare or buy software to help file their tax returns. More than 74,000 pages in length, no one — not even those in Washington who write the laws or enforce them — truly understands the tax code. But special interests are taking advantage of this confusion by hiring armies of accountants and Washington lobbyists to dodge taxes and cash in on the complexity of the code.  Developers are claiming $8 billion in tax credits every year supposedly to construct low-income housing. But with fewer homes being built and no basic accountability requirements, it is nearly impossible to track how the money is being spent. “IRS and no one else in the federal government really has an idea of what’s going on,” a government auditor admitted in testimony before Congress earlier this summer.  The same may be true for the hundreds of other tax loopholes.  A luxury yacht can qualify as a second home and be eligible for the mortgage interest deduction. Alaskan ship captains can expense costs for whaling as charitable deductions, even though no money goes to charity and whaling is illegal. High rollers can even itemize the cost of gambling trips, including entertainment. Even the cost of losing lottery tickets can be deducted, a scratch-off write-off.  Only the IRS knows who is taking advantage of these loopholes, and the agency cannot even verify that those claiming the tax breaks are eligible.  However, as tax reform begins in earnest on Capitol Hill and some of these loopholes are threatened we certainly will see forces mobilized to protect them. In fact, we could see many who would rather scuttle tax reform and threaten everyday Americans keeping more of their own paycheck than see these loopholes hit the wastebasket where they belong.  I look forward to highlighting some of these loopholes for the waste that they in fact represent and working to ensure that tax reform gets passed even over the objections of Washington’s special interests.  In addition, with an eye toward the future, I plan on introducing the Tax Expenditures Accountability Act, which will require the Treasury Department to disclose the corporate and special interests receiving tax credits.  As the alpaca lobby demonstrated, riding herd on tax breaks will cause every special interest benefiting from the code’s complexity and unfairness to bray. To achieve real reform that reduces tax bills for everyone, however, we cannot be deterred.","link","http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/355800-fighting-tax-loopholes?rnd=1508251989","thehill.com",120,202,22,3,13,8,1,29

This bill requires the Department of Treasury to disclose the special interests receiving tax credits, just as all other federal expenditures are currently disclosed on the public website, USAspending.gov.  Sunlight is the best disinfectant and I look forward to exposing many of these loopholes, eliminating them, and returning the savings to individual taxpayers in the form of lower rates.  But as the alpaca lobby demonstrated, riding herd on tax breaks will cause every special interest benefiting from the code’s complexity and unfairness to bray.  Washington’s powerful special interests will mobilize and threaten to derail tax reform.  Many would rather protect these loopholes than allow all taxpayers to keep more of their own paycheck. However, coming up short on tax reform is not an option. Individuals and businesses are suffering under a broken, antiquated tax code that is in dire need of fixing.    We cannot be deterred in efforts to achieve real reform that reduces tax bills for everyone.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatorjeffflake/videos/10154825712121646/",NA,505,382,79,17,26,8,5,103

This bill permanently clarifies the ambiguity in 1996 Lautenberg amendment to the Gun Control Act of 1968 as it applies to the military, and requires the military to report misdemeanors of domestic violence to the NICS database to be used in background checks for all legal gun purchases.

From the outset of the current debate on tax reform, my goal has been to ensure that Congress passes a tax reform package that is both fiscally-responsible and promotes economic growth. During the debate over the current bill, I’ve focused on two specific objectives. The first was to eliminate the $85 billion expensing budget gimmick in the bill. The second was to obtain a firm commitment from the Senate Leadership and the administration to work with me on a growth-oriented legislative solution to enact fair and permanent protections for DACA recipients.

In the chaotic aftermath of that awful morning, the gunman’s purpose slowly became clear. Because of our beliefs and political affiliation, this individual believed my colleagues and I deserved to die.  Since that day, I have struggled to understand this thinking. How could any American look out onto a field that June morning where a bunch middle-aged men were playing baseball, and somehow see “the enemy.”  Some of the bombastic rhetoric being offered in response to the tax reform bill passed this week has given me pause though.  If you listen to some of the hyperbolic vitriol that opponents of this bill are producing, the attitude that nearly killed my friend Steve Scalise, and threatened many more lives, begins to make a perverse kind of sense.  When respectable public figures go on television or take to Twitter and announce that thousands, if not millions, of Americans are going to die as a direct result of the passage of a tax reform bill, what impact do we expect this to have on the thinking of many Americans?  If a person takes these outlandish statements as truth, attacking Members of Congress who supported the measure almost appears to be a moral action.  This horrifying logic could lead someone to believe that killing a few legislators might save the lives of “millions of Americans.”  Beyond the physical danger of promoting such misinformation, these claims also do grave harm to the legislative process.  How are we expected to work together to achieve anything if one side’s position is viewed as the end of America as we know it?  One my colleagues called this tax reform bill, “the worst bill in the history of Congress.”  Upon the bill’s passage, one media pundit went so far as to encourage young Americans to flee their country and declared, “America died tonight.”  Full-throated and passionate debate should always be encouraged. We all love arguing the merits of supply-side economics, but this is not that.  This is demonizing of the worst kind.  It leaves all of us in this body unable to engage in the kind of negotiations and compromise Congress was created to foster.  To be clear, this is not a problem of one party or one moment.  During the public debate over the Affordable Care Act, members of my party engaged in similar tactics.  I was in the House Chamber when one of my Republican Colleagues stood and yelled “You lie!” at the President of the United States.  The accusation that passage of healthcare reform would result in so-called “death panels” was promoted far and wide by many Republicans.  One conservative commentator suggested the government would begin educating seniors on how to end their own lives.  A Republican legislator claimed the bill would put seniors in the position of being “put to death by their government.”  This rhetoric was wrong then and it is wrong now.  The threat posed to all of us, and to the democratic process from giving in to extreme rhetoric is not theoretical.  Some of us faced it on that baseball field in Alexandria in June, and all of us have witnessed its corrosive effect on Congress.  I urge my colleagues, all of us, let us end this practice where raw politics drowns out the supplications of the better angels of our nature.  Let us all be a little more humble as to our predictive powers when it comes to placing a value on the work we do here.  In reality, this legislation will probably not turn out to be as good as its proponents assert, nor as bad as its opponents contend.   The country is watching. It is my hope that we, all of us, can eschew contempt and vitriol in our speech, and be more measured in our tone.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatorjeffflake/videos/10154981156441646/",NA,1222,4265,484,241,44,19,38,484
