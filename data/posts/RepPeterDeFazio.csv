While the bill was being drafted, I fought for the creation of national exchanges and a national not-for profit plan that I hoped would set the example for single-payer healthcare. I also advocated for other critical reforms, including eliminating the anti-trust immunity for the insurance industry and regulating pharmaceutical pricing.  Unfortunately, Republicans in the Senate blocked these improvements to the legislation, and in the next election, they took over the House. Since that time the Republicans have done nothing but vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act; in six years they have never offered a plan to replace or improve the existing system.  I think there is broad agreement that the law needs improvement to benefit more Americans. However, the path to meaningful improvement is through bipartisan compromise—not through a reckless, partisan process rushed by Republican leadership to dismantle the Affordable Care Act with zero proposals to replace it. This approach will ruthlessly strip healthcare coverage from more than 30 million Americans, including more than 475,000 Oregonians.  Before congressional Republicans take the Affordable Care Act to the chopping block, they need to remember the reasons we passed healthcare reform in the first place. Eight years ago, insurance companies had free reign to price-gouge consumers. Individuals with pre-existing conditions could be denied healthcare coverage. Insurance companies could refuse to renew your coverage policy if you got sick. Costs were skyrocketing and the consumer—not big insurance companies—were paying the price. The Affordable Care Act changed all that and provided protection and security to millions of Americans. Today, our nation’s uninsured rate is the lowest it has ever been.  If the Affordable Care Act were to be repealed immediately, we would lose those protections. More than half a million Oregonians included under the law’s Medicaid expansion would lose coverage, and Oregon would be at risk to lose $3.56 billion in federal Medicaid dollars. Approximately 28,000 young people who have been allowed to stay on their parents’ insurance plans until age 26 could lose their insurance. More than 50,000 children across our state who benefit from the Children’s Health Insurance Program would be at risk of having their health insurance rolled back. Insurance companies would no longer be required to provide free preventative care. Oregon seniors will be forced to pay more for prescription drugs.  The law needs improvement, but we cannot overlook the enormous benefits that the Affordable Care Act has provided tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Oregonians. Improvements should be made in a deliberative and cooperative way. I urge my Republican colleagues not to rush the process to gain political points at the expense of families who depend on the Affordable Care Act.","status",NA,NA,983,193,300,66,0,4,64,24

Instead, it sends a message that Muslims are not welcome in America, alienates our allies and serves as a recruiting tool for ISIS and other terrorists groups, ultimately making America less secure.   The executive order uses false rhetoric and preys upon Americans' fears without doing anything to address the real terrorist threats facing our nation. Instead, it resulted in the detention of a 77-year-old grandmother planning to visit her family in Texas, an Iraqi translator who risked his life to work for the U.S. Army and two doctors working at the Cleveland Clinic, just to name a few.   The current refugee vetting process is already one of the most thorough screening processes for foreign visitors. This executive order does nothing to strengthen America’s national security, and instead has given the U.S. a black eye in the international community.   The worst terrorist attack on our nation, 9/11, was carried out by radicals from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon and the UAE. The attacks in San Bernardino were carried out by a Pakistani terrorist and an American-born terrorist. None of the procedures put in place by this executive order would have prevented any of these attacks.  This irresponsible order puts our nation at risk and stands in opposition to the ideals that our country was founded upon. It’s clear to me that my colleagues in Congress on both sides of the aisle will need to work together to restrain President Trump from inflicting more damage to our country.   I am joining my colleagues today to introduce the “Statue of Liberty Values Act” (SOLVe) which nullifies the executive order. The legislation states that it will have no effect or force of law and states that no funds or fees shall be used to implement the order.","status",NA,NA,811,191,244,98,2,2,43,17

While I have never said that the Affordable Care Act was a perfect law, the help it has given hundreds of thousands of Oregonians is undeniable.

Across the country, millions of families are being helped every single day.

Traditionally, each member of Congress is given a ticket for one guest to watch the President’s speech from the House Gallery. I’ve brought a number of well-deserving Oregonians in years past. Last year, I brought Steve Phillips, an out-of-work paper mill employee who had lost three jobs thanks to unfair foreign competition and our failed trade policies. Steve demonstrated the terrible impact that a new proposed trade deal, the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), would have had on our manufacturing economy—a deal we killed last fall.  This year I’m doing something different: I will be leaving my guest’s seat empty to represent one of my constituents who will go bankrupt, or die, if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. Across the country, people are pushing back against the threat of repeal with a massive outpouring of support for the ACA. If we continue to make our voices heard, we can defeat efforts to repeal this landmark legislation and perhaps make long overdue improvements.  In addition, this week I will be sharing stories from constituents who have been impacted by the ACA. Last week, I asked how the ACA has helped you and your family, and since then I’ve heard from scores of constituents. From reading your comments, it’s clear to me that we simply cannot go back to the ‘good old days’ of health insurance, when consumers were price-gouged, sick people were kicked off their coverage, and individuals were unable to get any insurance due to pre-existing conditions. We can, and must, do better, for all those who stand to lose their healthcare if the ACA is repealed.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepPeterDeFazio/photos/a.10150239477324812.343727.94324364811/10155059593924812/?type=3",NA,1312,228,197,174,2,5,29,8

For my first ACA story, Susan from Springfield writes:   In 2008, I experienced a major medical issue involving my heart.  I was uninsured, hospitalized and in the intensive care unit. I was given a diagnosis of heart failure without a known cause.  I was now uninsurable because of a “pre-existing condition”. The cost for one night in intensive care (and there were many) was $27,000—not including medication, tests, or cardiac specialists.     I lost my ability to work at all. I could no longer afford to see any doctor other than at the local county medical clinic. They could not properly treat me because I could not afford the additional testing required to rule out, or confirm a diagnosis, nor see a specialist that could. I was prescribed medications that I could not afford, and began experiencing very serious side effects to the medications.    I sold my house during the “housing crash” to pay my medical bills. Within a short period of time, I was broke, unable to work, and now homeless. I cannot begin to express not only the fear, shame, and absolute humility I felt not being able to take care of myself-  having to rely on others for a roof over my head, but even more so, my inability to help my children during such a critical time in their lives. I could not afford to get the mental health support I needed during these times. I was told I was dying and that I needed to get my affairs in order.    When the Affordable Care Act became law, I was able to get insurance, and was able to see the specialists I needed. I was told that I have three to five years to live from the date of my original diagnosis.  That was 2008.  It is now 2017. If I had not received the insurance that I did, I would not have received the care that I did, and I would have died.","status",NA,NA,62,8,19,2,0,0,11,0

When my husband passed away I was offered the choice of staying on that same plan through COBRA—at the cost of almost $700 a month. I could not afford this.  Instead, the only insurance that I could afford was catastrophic health insurance, which allowed me to go to the doctor with a co-pay of $30 four times a year, or a specialist with a co-pay of $50 four times a year. If I needed to see either after this, my insurance covered nothing until I paid the $11,000 deductible. To have this insurance, I was paying over $300 a month.  After the Affordable Care Act passed, I was finally able to afford healthcare that covered all my medical care. It is my fear that if the Affordable Health Care is repealed, I and millions of others will not be able to afford health care that covers our needs. It feels as if we are losing so much as it is.

The President’s budget ends public service loan forgiveness and gets rid of subsidized loans for all students, while failing to adjust Pell Grants for inflation—for the first time in six years.  It strips $48 billion from Social Security’s disability program (an earned benefit), fails to deliver on promised infrastructure investment, makes cruel cuts to Meals on Wheels, and cuts federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps, by 25%.    The budget cuts funding for programs like Foster Grandparents, Senior Companions, AmeriCorps and YouthBuild that benefit thousands of Oregonians and the individuals and communities they serve, while irresponsibly ballooning the deficit.

These funds already exist—they are levied on the consumer when they buy their airline ticket—but Congressional Republicans continue to raid the fund for other uses.   TSA needs to address ongoing threats to airline safety. The funds to do so are available but TSA continues to lack the resources it desperately needs and travelers expect in order to mask ballooning federal deficits through a budget gimmick.

While there is still much work to be done to correct our nation’s injustices towards Native Americans, the passage of this legislation is an encouraging move toward progress.","status",NA,NA,737,108,115,142,1,8,1,2
