They’ve seen their worst nightmares become reality in other Utah counties as a result of a presidential national-monument designation. That’s why on December 29, the day after President Obama announced the Bears Ears monument, a crowd of several hundred Utahns assembled to hold a protest on the steps of the San Juan County courthouse.   Braving the frigid weather, they gathered together to demonstrate that they – the individuals and families who will be directly affected by a Bears Ears national monument – believe the president has no business seizing vast stretches of public lands to be micromanaged, and mismanaged, by federal agencies.   But the protestors weren’t just angry. They were resolute, confident about the future, and determined to keep fighting for their right to participate in the management of the land in their community.   Of course, environmentalists and national-monument advocates want the people of San Juan County to believe that the fight is over and that they lost. In their view, President Obama’s proclamation of the Bears Ears National Monument is permanent, irreversible, carved in stone. As one White House official recently told The Washington Post, “We do not see that the Trump administration has authority to undo this.”  But Madam President, that’s because they’re not looking hard enough.   The truth is, what can be done through unilateral executive action can also be undone the same way. Such is the impermanence of executive power in our constitutional republic, where major policy changes require broad consensus, forged through legislative compromise, to endure the test of time.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatormikelee/videos/1356736817691341/",NA,869,112,315,38,2,10,10,48

A new president brings new opportunities to fix what’s broken in our government, to think afresh about old problems, and to recommit ourselves to the shared American project of working together to build a more perfect union.   But the inauguration of a new president – that fleeting moment when the past meets the future and power is peacefully transferred from one administration to the next – also encourages us to take stock of our present situation and reflect on the challenges we face as a nation.    Conventional wisdom holds that the great malady plaguing American life today is the toxic combination of political polarization and social fragmentation. And there’s a great deal of truth to this diagnosis. We are, as one astute observer put it, a “fractured republic,” fraught with intense divisions and deep anxieties that are not easily resolved.   But I believe our polarization is merely a symptom of a far deeper problem in America today – a problem that actually unites us, more than it divides us.   Ask the American people to share their opinions on a particular public policy – be it immigration, health care, same-sex marriage, or any hotly contested issue – and you’ll likely receive a wide variety of responses. These are our dividing lines. But ask them whether they think their opinions actually matter to those charged with making policy – ask them whether their elected representatives truly represent their interests – and the public is suddenly unified.     A recent public poll found that three-quarters of Americans believe most elected government officials “don’t care what people like me think.” What do they care about? Catering to the narrow agendas of the powerful and well-connected, according to the same supermajority of respondents, who said the federal government is “run by a few big interests” rather than “for the benefit of all the people.”  The American people know they are no longer in charge of their government. They know each year their elected representatives in Washington grow increasingly indifferent, if not downright hostile, to their interests and concerns. And they know – thanks to last year’s election – that they no longer have to tolerate a political establishment committed to taking power away from the people, first by pulling it up away from states and localities and toward the federal government, and then by consolidating it in the hands of Washington’s unelected bureaucrats.   This drive toward centralization of policymaking power is rooted in an unspoken distrust of the American people’s capacity to govern themselves. But the history of America, and the principles of the Republican Party, prove this distrust to be utterly unfounded. As Abraham Lincoln – America’s first Republican president – put it in his first inaugural address: “Why should there not be patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people? Is there any better or equal hope in the world?”   On the eve of America's civil war, Lincoln placed his trust - and his hope for a brighter future - squarely on the side of the people. As we seek to heal the wounds of division in our own day, we should follow his lead.   Winning back the people's trust must be the primary goal of the Republican Party as we assume unified control over Congress and the presidency, and there's only one way to accomplish it: by putting our trust back in the people.","status",NA,NA,896,140,126,92,5,2,2,5

I also believe part of the reason working Americans have been left behind is that they have been cut out of the governing of their own country. Too many decisions are being made in Washington, D.C., and too often by unelected bureaucrats who unaccountably impose their values on communities and people they have never met.  Reasserting federalism is more than a constitutional principle. As we look around our increasingly divided national community, policymakers must do whatever we can to lower the temperature of our politics. Centralizing more power in Washington, as presidents of both parties have done for too long, and justifying it with self-serving platitudes about “compassion,” “who we are” or “the right side of history” obviously hasn’t worked.  The only thing that will work is embracing the principle of subsidiarity – and sending non-national decisions out into our diverse society, where different communities can experiment with different ideas about how to meet their own unique challenges, according to their unique priorities.

The Environmental Protection Agency is notorious for this top-down, Washington-knows-best approach to regulation, which runs roughshod over the immense diversity of local circumstances in our large country. Too often, the EPA treats states and state regulators not as partners but as adversaries.   Scott Pruitt understands this well, because he has seen it first-hand. As Attorney General of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt has spent many years being ignored and pushed around by Washington – an experience that has taught him the need for the EPA to work with, not condescend to, the states.   That’s why I’m so pleased that Scott Pruitt is on his way to lead the EPA. The agency exists to protect the American people, not advance the narrow agenda of some special interests while punishing others. I am confident that Pruitt is the right man for the job and will remain independent while correcting the troubling course that the EPA has taken in recent decades.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatormikelee/videos/1403605226337833/",NA,910,284,107,54,1,2,7,177

They were the targets of a mob’s violence – their names are Allison Stanger, professor of political science at Middlebury College, and Charles Murray, author of several groundbreaking books, including the controversial Bell Curve, and scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. America deserves to hear their story, which is why I shared their accounts in this floor speech.  I know tensions are high in America today. I know what it’s like to be on the losing side of a bitterly fought presidential election.   But that does not give anyone the license to shout down a fellow American – let alone physically assault them - just because they hold a different opinion. Democracy and freedom depend on an open, tolerant, and civil political discourse. And sustaining our democratic freedoms is the sole purpose the federal government subsidizes institutions of higher education in this country.   It is embarrassing that teachers and students at an elite college like Middlebury should need reminding, but: Speech is not violence. Violence is not speech. And the totalitarians who fail to recognize this core fact of decency and tolerance are goosestepping into some of the darkest corners of the human heart.   If there’s anything that should unite us in these polarized times, it’s that the kind of violence we saw on Middlebury’s campus last week must not not be tolerated.

Personally, I think you’ve made your views on this subject very clear.  ""I’m sure some of my colleagues will complain that you aren’t providing any hints as to how you’ll rule. But that’s a reason for confirmation, not against it. In our system, judges don’t provide advisory opinions, they decide cases and controversies only after each side has an opportunity to make its case before the bench. And they do so outside of political influence.  ""In an odd twist, some of the same colleagues who will question your independence will also push you to answer questions you simply can’t.  ""I’m sure that some of my colleagues will pick apart some of your rulings. They’ll try to say you’re hostile to particular types of claims or to particular plaintiffs. I don’t think it’s productive to evaluate someone’s judicial record by looking at who wins or loses in his courtroom. It goes without saying that, in our system, you face the same burden of convincing the court regardless of who you are, and judges don’t decide cases based on their own personal preferences. But to my colleagues who go down that road: The record shows that you apply the law neutrally in all cases, without regard to the parties."" #GorsuchHearing","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatormikelee/videos/1435355839829438/",NA,734,94,111,82,2,1,2,18

No, the money is here because the power is here. Concentrated in the hands of just a few elites. So in that respect, it should come as no surprise that there are people who spend an extraordinary amount of money, trying to make sure that they can get access to that power.   When a power controls as much of the economy as it does, as much of the lives and livelihoods as it does, there are people willing, whether they are rich or poor or somewhere in between, to invest a whole lot of money in trying to influence government. So I wonder, why is it that we're so slow to ask the question, why do we allow this much power to be accumulated in government?

Today’s action begins the process of undoing the agency’s 2015 Open Internet Order, which upended the decades-old bipartisan consensus that consumers – not government regulators – should control the information superhighway.  But today’s FCC action is only the first step in protecting Internet innovation. A stable regulatory environment can only come from congressional action. This is why I recently introduced the Restoring Internet Freedom Act, which would not only repeal the 2015 Order but also prevent the FCC from further action without congressional mandate.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate, House, and FCC, to further promote competition by removing other existing barriers to entry. Only competition – among Internet Service Providers, apps, platforms, content creators, and all other firms across the Internet – can ensure that consumers, not the government, pick winners and losers who provide the best services at the lowest prices.","status",NA,NA,652,127,111,46,3,1,0,133

During the constitutional convention, he actually favored crowning an American king, a misguided proposal he dubbed the “English model.” Yet Hamilton understood that even the monarchical executive he preferred needed limits to his power. In Federalist 84, he listed some of the abuses of an out-of-control executive, singling out “arbitrary imprisonments.” He called them the “favorite and most formidable instruments” of tyrants.  The Constitution includes safeguards against this form of tyranny, including the right of habeas corpus and the guarantee that American citizens will not be “deprived of life, liberty, or property” by the government “without due process of law.”  Our commitment to these rights is tested in times of crisis. We have not always passed these tests. During the Second World War, President Franklin Roosevelt unilaterally authorized the internment of over 100,000 Japanese-Americans for fear they would spy against the United States. Most of them were native-born citizens. Many had never been to Japan before in their lives.  The internment of Japanese-Americans is a dark chapter in the nation’s history—the Supreme Court decision that enabled it, Korematsu v. United States, belongs to the “anti-canon” of worst Supreme Court decisions of all time, along with Plessy v. Ferguson and Dred Scott v. Sandford. The episode is a warning of how dangerous it is when we permit the executive branch to slip its constitutional restraints.  With this warning in mind, in 1971 Congress curbed the executive branch’s power to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens by passing the Non-Detention Act, which states that “[n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.”  On Wednesday, I introduced the Due Process Guarantee Act, along with Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Ted Cruz, and several other colleagues, to further protect Americans from indefinite detention by the government.  Since the 9/11 attacks and the emergence of terrorist groups like ISIS, there has been renewed pressure to diminish our constitutional protections while growing government. Lawmakers from both parties have rushed to grant the executive branch the power to detain Americans without charge, without trial, and without meeting the evidentiary standard required for every other crime—potentially for life.  The Due Process Guarantee Act would raise the bar the government has to clear in order to indefinitely detain American citizens and lawful permanent residents apprehended on U.S. soil. It would forbid the government from justifying such detentions using general authorizations of military force, such as the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force against the terrorists responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Instead, the government would be required to obtain explicit, written approval from Congress.  Our bill is based on a simple premise: If the president wants to go outside the ordinary law enforcement system to apprehend an American on U.S. soil without charge or trial, he needs extraordinary permission from Congress. And if elected representatives want to give the president this awesome power over their constituents, they need to be honest about it by granting an explicit authorization. They shouldn’t hide behind vague laws.    The bill is based also on my faith in our law enforcement officers and judges, who have successfully apprehended and prosecuted hundreds of homegrown terrorists. Their example proves that our security is not dependent on a supercharged president and weakened Constitution. We can secure the homeland without using the “formidable instruments” of tyrants.","status",NA,NA,480,75,76,35,0,3,0,7

Faced with an honest debate the American people wisely chose not to gamble with their household budgets for speculative environmental benefits.  After losing fair and square, President Obama abandoned the democratic process and pursued his climate priorities through executive fiat. He twisted the Clean Air Act to enact policies the law was never intended to allow. Then he ran to the international community seeking a blessing of legitimacy that the American people never gave him.  President Obama never submitted his Paris Accord to the United States Senate as the Constitution requires for treaties. Instead he hoped that future presidents would bow to foreign pressure and go along with an international regulatory regime the American people never approved.

Absent ObamaCare’s health-insurance regulations, premiums would fall for the vast majority of Exchange enrollees by an estimated 45-68 percent. It would allow insurers to reintroduce innovative products, which ObamaCare effectively outlawed, that would reduce premiums a further 80 percent(!). Consumers could purchase long-term, guaranteed-renewable coverage that protects them from premium spikes when they fall ill, provides coverage more comprehensive than ObamaCare, and is more secure than employer coverage. Risk-based premiums stabilize insurance markets and enable these quality improvements.

There is no way around that.   But it may also be a blessing in disguise.  The bill we were voting on, what many in the media were referring to as a “skinny” repeal bill, was truly an anemic effort. While it did repeal the individual mandate permanently, it provided only temporary relief from the employer mandate and medical device tax. It also left the rest of the Affordable Care Act’s regulations, taxes, and subsidies completely intact. By some estimates it repealed just two percent of Obamacare.  Even worse then the product we were voting on was the process that led to last night’s vote.   The bill we voted on around 1:30 Friday morning was only released about three hours before. It was only a handful of pages, so there was time to read it (for a change). But there was no serious debate or deliberation about its contents. Amendments could be offered, but without reports from the Congressional Budget Office about their impact on the economy and the federal budget, they required 60 votes for passage.  The bill was written in secret, with no input from either the formal congressional committees charged with oversight of our health care system, or the informal working group assigned by our leadership to craft the legislation.  My preferred amendment sat at CBO for four weeks without being given a “score” detailing its projected costs and benefits. My colleague Ron Johnson (R-WI) waited four months for a CBO report on various Obamacare provisions, without any response.  This is not the way the Senate is supposed to work. It is not the way a free people is supposed to govern itself.  When the bill failed, many declared the issue dead. But as long as Obamacare is on the books, hurting millions of Americans and driving up the cost of healthcare, this issue isn’t going anywhere.  We must now go back to the drawing board. We must go back to the proper committees of jurisdiction and start from the beginning by identifying the specific policy problems we are trying to solve and then craft reforms to solve them.  The United States is a large, vibrant, and diverse country. There is no reason to assume the health care policies that work in a state with the demographics of Florida will also work in a state like Utah.  What we need to identify is a politically palatable way to give states the freedom needed to craft their own health care solutions. At the heart of this effort must be true freedom from the federal regulations that are the main drivers of our nation’s rising health care costs.","status",NA,NA,1761,918,440,107,14,11,28,161

I feel the need to stress this point because of the alarming behavior of some of my colleagues.  Yesterday, Notre Dame Law Professor Amy Coney Barrett came before the Senate Judiciary Committee. She had been nominated to be a circuit court judge. Her nomination has been endorsed by prominent legal scholars from across the political spectrum, including Neal Katyal, President Obama’s acting solicitor general.  Nonetheless, at Ms. Barrett’s confirmation hearing a number of my Democratic colleagues insinuated that her Catholic faith would prevent her from applying the law freely and fairly.  “Dogma and law are two different things,” remarked one of my colleagues. “ . . . When you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you. And that’s a concern.”  Another of my colleagues even asked Ms. Barrett to confess her faith under oath.  “What’s an ‘orthodox Catholic?’” this Committee member asked. “Do you consider yourself an ‘orthodox Catholic’?”  If these remarks had been some sort of bizarre aberration, I might have passed over them in polite silence.  But I feel compelled to speak out because I see a pattern emerging.

One need look no further than the outpouring of assistance in response to recent natural disasters for powerful illustrations of American civic-mindedness. In 2006 and 2007, over a million volunteers joined the recovery effort in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. One year after Superstorm Sandy, the Federal Emergency Management Agency reported that, “some 173,544 volunteers had invested more than 1 million volunteer hours in the Sandy recovery effort.” And already, Americans have responded to the devastation of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma with characteristic generosity.  One of the findings in the Social Capital Project’s first report, “What We Do Together,” was that volunteering rates in the US are no lower than in the 1970s, in contrast to many indicators of social capital that have worsened over time. In fact, we found that the number of hours spent volunteering per person has increased.

In reality, just 10 million people did.  The CBO's model was off by more than 100 percent.  The same CBO estimate predicted that Medicaid would grow by 17 million enrollees to about 52 million. In reality, more than 34 million people have signed up for Medicaid since Obamacare became law, for a total of 74.5 million recipients today.  Again, the CBO's model was off by around 100 percent.  Now the CBO wants us to believe, based on the same models, that just repealing Obamacare's individual mandate, without a single dime's worth of cuts to Medicaid, would cause more than 7 million people to abandon their Medicaid coverage.  There are good reasons to be skeptical of the quality of healthcare that lower-income Americans receive through Medicaid, but why would 7 million voluntarily give up Medicaid coverage they receive for free? These CBO projections, and others like it, strain the boundaries of common sense.  When it comes to topics like the effectiveness of the individual mandate, there are sharp disagreements among experts. That's why, in the academic community, scholars have to ""show their work"" by publicly disclosing their data, estimates, and analysis to scholarly scrutiny, and most importantly, refinement and improvement.  Congress does need a scorekeeper to provide budgetary estimates for the policy changes it considers. But at a bare minimum, that scorekeeper should be forced to show how its models work. Currently the CBO doesn't have to do that. It's a ""black box,"" a secret formula even Congress can't be allowed to see, yet which the House and Senate must treat as if they were handed down on stone tablets at Mt. Sinai.  It's an indefensible situation.  That is why I have introduced the CBO Show Your Work Act of 2017. This bill would require the CBO to publish its data, models, and all details of computation used in its cost analysis and scoring. CBO would keep its role as official scorekeeper of congressional budget proposals – but now the public and the economic community would be able to see what's going on in all those spreadsheets and algorithms.  That is, it would hold CBO to the same standard the American Economic Association's ""Data Availability Policy"" sets for all academic economists: requiring all paper authors to ensure their data ""are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication.""

Preliminary estimates from the CDC indicate there were 64,000 overdose deaths in 2016 - a 22 percent rise over 2015. Opioids, a class of drugs including heroin, fentanyl, and many prescription pain pills, account for the bulk of that increase. Fentanyl drug overdose deaths more than doubled in in 2016.   The Social Capital Project is exploring connections between the opioid crisis and the health of our human relationships—including our ties with families, friends, neighbors, religious congregants, and coworkers. Forthcoming research will examine how the health of our associational life affects our physical and mental health, focusing on so-called “deaths of despair”—mortality from opioid and other drug overdoses, alcohol-related disease, and suicide.

The family is the most important institution in our society – and our economy.  It is an incubator of economic opportunity, an indicator of economic success, and it’s becoming more socially and economically important every day.  Unfortunately, the current tax code singles out parents of young children and unfairly double taxes them. It is what I call the ""parent tax penalty,"" a glitch in the federal tax code that requires parents to contribute to senior entitlement programs not once, but twice. My idea for solving this penalty is to expand the Child Tax Credit and make it refundable against payroll tax liability. This would start to level the playing field to treat all taxpayers more equally. For a working-class family, this is an immediate, potentially life-changing reform.  In short, the Child Tax Credit would restore opportunities to working parents and their children to pursue happiness that right now federal policy unfairly denies them.

Nor is the problem confined to people who first receive lawful prescriptions, get hooked, and never escape their addictions.

They detox, lose their resistance, then take their old drug dosages and die.

Doing so would make the United States a more attractive place to do business and would spur economic growth.

A healthy family life is the foundation for a healthy associational life. Children can overcome the negative consequences of being raised in unhappy or unstable families, but many start out the game of life already behind in crucial ways. More profoundly, weakened family life portends a diminished ability of a people to promote and nurture the civil society and pro-social norms that facilitate happiness and prosperity.  One important way in which family life has weakened in America is reflected in the increasing share of births that occur to unmarried couples. This trend has left fewer children in families mutually planned by parents with the intention of permanence, and more children in the care of parents unconstrained by the commitments of marriage. The share of births to unwed mothers stands at 40 percent—up from 5 percent in 1960. We estimate that nearly half of births start as an unwed pregnancy, including two-thirds of first births to women under 30.  My most recent report for the Social Capital Project explores the rise in unwed childbearing over the past 60 years, examining trends that have interacted to accelerate the unwed share of births. While many changes have played a role, we find that the most important have been the increase in the pool of never-married women (expanding the number of potential unwed mothers) and the decline in post-conception, pre-birth marriage (“shotgun marriage”). These two trends appear much more consequential than increases in nonmarital sexual activity, declines in marital fertility, or changes in the likelihood of obtaining an abortion. https://www.lee.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2017/12/love-marriage-and-the-baby-carriage","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatormikelee/videos/1703012523063767/",NA,611,634,430,16,14,78,399,130

Delivering more take home pay for these working Utah families is why I voted for this bill.  Now there is still a lot to be done. First and foremost we need to work with Democrats to make these middle-class tax cuts permanent. Second, we can do even more for lower-income working families by making the expanded Child Tax Credit in this bill fully refundable up to payroll tax liability.
