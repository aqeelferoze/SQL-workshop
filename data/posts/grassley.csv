Mejia remains at large, continuing to deprive the Root family of the justice and closure they deserve.

Trump announced his intention to nominate Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the next Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court. The Senate Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over the federal courts and will vet and conduct a hearing on the nominee.  “Judge Gorsuch is universally respected across the ideological spectrum as a mainstream judge who applies the law without regard to person or his own preferences. By all accounts, he has a record of deciding cases based on the text of the Constitution and the law. That’s important because in our system of government, Congress, not judges, make the laws. I look forward to continuing to review his qualifications and to hearing from Judge Gorsuch himself about his approach to the law.  “Following the death of Justice Scalia as Americans were beginning to cast their votes for the next President, I said that we’d move forward with the next President’s nomination to the Supreme Court, regardless of who won. The President has made his selection and that’s what we’ll do.”  Gorsuch was confirmed to the circuit court by unanimous voice vote in 2006 with the bipartisan support of his home state senators Wayne Allard and Ken Salazar. There are 31 sitting senators who were in the Senate at the time of the unanimous confirmation vote, including 11 Democrats. Prior to being a circuit court judge, he practiced law, clerked for two Supreme Court Justices, and earned a doctorate degree in legal philosophy from Oxford.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senjudiciary/videos/412383402433281/",NA,163,108,0,14,0,0,1,40

Trump’s first joint session of Congress.    “President Trump delivered an assessment of the challenges we face as a country, but he also outlined a call to action for Congress and the White House to work to address those many challenges,” Senator Grassley said following the address.     “I appreciated the President’s emphasis on curbing harmful government regulations that are not only counterproductive but too often stifle the full potential of the American worker, farmer and entrepreneur. The Environmental Protection Agency’s poorly conceived ‘Waters of the U.S.’ rule is only one of many such regulations that do little to serve the interests of Iowans and pose a serious threat to local economies.    “I was glad to hear the President state his desire to work with Congress on a comprehensive overhaul of the federal tax code, which is outdated, and should be made fairer and simpler. Boosting domestic manufacturing should be a priority, as well as maintaining the integrity of existing laws meant to encourage the use of clean energy, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard. Renewable energy employs tens of thousands of Iowans and many others around the country. That ought to stay as it is and even improve.    “Like the tax code, any renegotiation of international trade deals must consider the agricultural sector of the American economy, which accounts for one in five jobs in Iowa and is the backbone of the rural economy.    “I welcome the President’s pledge to keep his commitment to work to repeal and replace Obamacare with a plan that increases access to quality health care and lowers costs for American families. Far too many Iowans face skyrocketing premiums, making quality health care unaffordable for them as this broken law continues to collapse. And the Administration and Congress should act to bring down the high prices of prescription drugs.    “I’m also glad the President kept his pledge to nominate a Supreme Court justice who is committed to interpreting law not making law, helping to safeguard our system of government with its three co-equal branches providing checks and balances on one another.    “I was heartened to hear the President reiterate his promise to protect our nation’s borders and enforce federal immigration laws to ensure that dangerous criminal illegal immigrants aren’t let loose on American streets. He’s also making sure that the victims and the families of victims of criminal illegal immigrants will not be forgotten. Through the creation of the Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement office, for which I have advocated, people like Sarah Root’s family will have a voice and a place to turn for answers as they seek justice against the perpetrators of crime against their loved ones.    “The President made clear that he is focused on rebuilding the nation’s military, infrastructure and economy and that he intends to keep his promise to put Americans’ interests first.

Her ability to continue in her job as Attorney General depended on a Clinton victory in the election.  “And she had a private meeting with President Bill Clinton on her government airplane while the Department was investigating Secretary Clinton.  “Where were the calls from Democratic Leadership for a special counsel then? Where were these calls for a special counsel when Congress referred a criminal contempt citation to the Department of Justice against Attorney General Holder for withholding documents in the Fast and Furious scandal?  “He misled Congress about when he learned about Fast and Furious.

The reality is much different. Obamacare is hurting more people than it is helping. I have heard from many Iowans about the tremendous premium increases and the high deductibles and copays that make Obamacare not worth it...It is time to spend less and get better quality care.""

Senator Joni Ernst is an original co-sponsor.  “U.S. tax policy should support U.S. products and U.S. jobs,” Senator Grassley said. “This bipartisan bill would end a system that gives many foreign producers a leg up over U.S. producers and give certainty to the biodiesel industry, which is responsible for employing thousands of Americans. Iowa producers shouldn’t be put at a disadvantage by foreign producers that in many cases are double dipping by benefiting from U.S. tax incentives on top of their own significant government subsidies. These reforms supporting domestic producers would also save taxpayers money.”   According to the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, the biodiesel industry supports nearly 4,000 Iowa jobs, generates more than $300 million of income for Iowa households and accounts for $447 million of Iowa’s GDP.

The facts speak for themselves: Obamacare is not living up to its promises.”  “Here’s a prime example. One farmer’s insurance premium went through the roof – it jumped 43 percent in 2017 from 2016. If somebody can explain how that’s more affordable, I have oceanfront property in Butler County, Iowa, to sell you.   “Another constituent from Garner, Iowa, wrote about her financial hardship. She said: ‘We are going to be paying over $1,300 a month on premiums, plus $6,000 deductible. We don’t have that much longer before we qualify for Medicare, but my concern is that until then, we will have to use so much of our hard-earned savings just to pay for healthcare. My fear is that those of us in the middle class will struggle with paying so much that it will wipe out our retirement savings.’  “Another constituent, from Buffalo, Iowa, wrote to me, saying: ‘I am forced to pay $230 a month for a health care plan that covers NOTHING until I reach $11,000 in deductible. So on top of paying 100 percent of my medical bills anyway, now I also have to pay for insurance I can’t use.’”  Watch Senator Grassley’s full speech below or read his remarks here: https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-outlines-myth-affordability-under-affordable-care-act","video","https://www.facebook.com/grassley/videos/10155215122960797/",NA,265,233,96,11,3,6,18,92

Senator Grassley also reminded lawmakers of their constitutional responsibility to act as a check on the executive branch and continue to pursue rigorous oversight of the federal government on behalf of the American people.  “It cannot take years for this body to get answers from a co-equal branch of government about information that has no legal basis to stay hidden from Congress,” Senator Grassley said. “That is why I am working with my colleagues on proposals to modernize the rules of engagement in congressional oversight. We need a package of rules and legislative changes so that responders to congressional inquiries cannot rely on phony privilege claims and delay tactics.”   Read Senator Grassley’s full statement here: https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-operation-fast-and-furious-six-years-later","video","https://www.facebook.com/grassley/videos/10155284350690797/",NA,189,75,73,17,1,2,0,18

Senator Grassley also raised concerns that the Marshals Service has failed to properly implement their substantial training program for pursuing high-risk, violent fugitives, despite numerous warnings from employees. Better implementation and oversight could avoid tragedies like the 2015 death of a U.S. Marshal during an operation in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Media reports suggest that Ukrainian “political leadership” opposed the candidacy of Donald Trump for president of the United States and worked with a Democratic National Committee consultant to undermine his campaign. This consultant allegedly had various meetings with Ukrainian government officials, including embassy staff, to coordinate the dissemination of incriminating information about Trump campaign officials.  It appears that this consultant was operating to advance the interests of both the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton campaign, and a foreign government, which would have required registration under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).    In his letter, Chairman Grassley requests information on any actions taken by the Justice Department pursuant to FARA in this case, the differences between this case and similar cases in which the Justice Department required registration and whether the Department is investigating links and coordination between the Ukrainian government and individuals associated with the campaign of Hillary Clinton or the Democratic National Committee.  On Wednesday, July 26, the Judiciary Committee will convene a hearing to examine enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act and attempts to influence U.S. elections.

This resolution, which the Senate has passed every year since it was first introduced by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) in 2013, commemorates the enactment of America’s first whistleblower law. The history behind this resolution is remarkable. It marks one of the first real tests of American democracy and how those in power would treat whistleblowers who exposed wrongdoing within the revolutionary government itself,” wrote Stephen Kohn in an op-ed for The Hill.   “In February 1777, ten sailors and marines aboard the ship Warren, stationed in Providence harbor, signed a petition protesting the actions of the first commodore of the United States Navy. They accused their commander of gross misconduct, mistreating prisoners of war and war profiteering. One of the ten whistleblowers, Captain of the Marines John Grannis, jumped ship (without permission) and presented the whistleblowers’ petition to the Continental Congress. The Founding Fathers were tested. How would the new revolutionary government treat dissent? How would they judge United States citizens raising serious allegations aimed at a high-ranking official appointed by the Congress itself?”  Read more about the history of whistleblower protection below.

He understands that much of the money federal agencies spend is an aggregation of the tax dollars paid by average Americans of modest means. Grassley understands that people work hard to earn that money and have a right to expect it will be spent honestly with wisdom and frugality. Grassley keeps a watchful eye on the federal government’s campaign against waste and fraud.  “Recently, he pressed for better oversight of the $9.6 billion program the federal government created to help homeowners who were negatively affected by the housing crisis. Unfortunately, officials have done a poor job in preventing wasteful expenditures by some bureaucrats.”  “Congress didn’t intend this program for bureaucrats to live high on the hog, yet the bureaucrats in question did exactly that,” Senator Grassley said. “They bought barbecue and gift cards for themselves with taxpayer dollars. $3 million might sound like decimal dust to those who write big checks at the Treasury Department, but it’s a lot of money for people struggling to keep their homes. Every single agency that squandered this money needs to pay back every penny to the American taxpayers. The Treasury Department must make that happen. The buck starts with the Treasury Department, and it stops with the Treasury Department. There’s no excuse to let this slide.”   “The Messenger strongly agrees,” wrote the editorial board. “We applaud Grassley’s determination to make certain our tax dollars are not wasted on frivolous expenditures.”","link","http://www.messengernews.net/opinion/editorial/2017/09/grassley-protects-us-taxpayers/","messengernews.net",149,63,23,14,34,0,2,9

It will be voted on by the House of Representatives later today before going to the President for his signature this afternoon. Senator Grassley successfully included taxpayer rights and corporate accountability measures in the tax reform legislation, and also helped protect the wind energy production tax credit, which he originally authored, and the student loan interest deduction.   “This historic legislation makes good on a promise to deliver tax relief to Americans from every walk of life and income level. Its passage is good news for working families, U.S. jobs and industry and an economy that was stagnant for far too long. It will let Iowans keep more of their own money, so they can choose how best to spend what they’ve earned. Wages will also grow and jobs will return to our shores as a result of making American industry and workers more globally competitive,” Senator Grassley said.  “There have been some misconceptions about what this legislation does, which ideological opponents of lower taxes have helped sow. Iowans are understandably paying close attention to how they will be impacted. Iowans should rest assured they will begin seeing more in their take home pay almost immediately, and that will continue for years to come. This tax reform legislation lowers rates on every income level, and the progressivity of the tax code is maintained, ensuring that Iowans of all stripes will share the benefits of tax reform, and no one group is treated unfairly. As just one example, the average family of four with two children will see a tax cut of more than $2,000, and millions of lower-income Americans will be removed from the tax rolls entirely. That will make a real difference in the lives of so many hardworking Iowans.  “This bill also repeals the unfair and regressive Obamacare individual mandate tax. The bottom line is that this gives Iowans the freedom to make health care choices that work best for them, instead of being forced by the government to purchase an unaffordable product they either don’t want or don’t need. In 2015, more than 52,000 Iowans were required to pay the individual mandate tax, even though more than 80 percent of those who paid the tax made less than $50,000 a year. That’s a tax on middle-class families, and I’m glad to see it gone.”  https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-votes-historic-tax-relief-iowans","photo","https://www.facebook.com/grassley/photos/a.10150437772385797.420695.106480645796/10155895228075797/?type=3",NA,517,604,40,80,7,2,25,614
