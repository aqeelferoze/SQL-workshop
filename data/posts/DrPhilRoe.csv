I was proud to hear the president discuss our shared priorities like creating and keeping good-paying jobs; repealing and replacing Obamacare; ensuring we have a secure border and strong military; investing in infrastructure; and reforming the VA to work for our nation’s heroes.   This is the kind of vision and direction our country has lacked but desperately needed for the last eight years; and I look forward to working with President Trump and his administration to leave a better and stronger America for our children and grandchildren. #JointAddress","status",NA,NA,380,44,8,31,9,0,1,4

That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.” –President Donald Trump  This week, President Trump gave his first joint address to Congress and to the American people. During this speech, President Trump laid out a bold, positive and encouraging agenda, and I personally thought it was one of the most powerful speeches we’ve heard from President Trump to date. For the last eight years, I’ve repeatedly said that our country needed strong leadership to put forward a clear vision and direction for the future, and the president’s address did just that. Our nation is still the best country in the world, but we’ve lost our way. We’ve got some work to do to leave a better, stronger America for our children and grandchildren, but President Trump was right to say we can’t do this alone. Republicans and Democrats must come together and finally put party politics aside to deliver the results the American people deserve.

The IPAB is a board of 15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats created to reduce Medicare spending. The IPAB, once triggered, makes recommendations regarding cuts to Medicare without any Congressional oversight or input. IPAB proposals are considered using “fast track” procedures and, absent a three-fifths vote in the Senate, only allows Congress to modify the type of cuts to Medicare, not the amount.   If Congress fails to act on the board’s recommendations, they automatically go into effect. To make matters worse, the IPAB is exempt from any judicial or administrative review. Further, if the president doesn’t nominate anyone to serve on the IPAB, or if the IPAB fails to recommend Medicare spending reductions, the law gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services an enormous amount of power, allowing them to make changes to Medicare spending unilaterally. This means one person could have the power to drastically shape Medicare spending with no accountability to Congress, the administration or — most importantly — the American people.That's why I'm leading the charge to repeal the IPAB.

I look forward to the next one! In addition to the questions I answered during the live discussion, I wanted to take a moment to address some of the other issues raised during the town hall.    With regard to health care, I've seen some questions about whether Congress exempted themselves from the American Health Care Act. Congressmen and women are not exempt. Because of the Senate rules on what can and cannot be included in a bill moved using reconciliation, the language that states Congress is not exempt could not be added to the American Health Care Act. That's why the House passed H.R. 2192, introduced by Martha McSally, by a vote of 429 to 0 before AHCA was considered. This measure will ensure members of Congress and their staffs are not exempt from this law.    I also noticed some questions about the number of town halls I've held this year. As you may know, I've held more than 40 in-person town hall meetings since I've served as your Congressman. Already this year, I've had in-person town hall meetings in Elizabethton and Greeneville, and have conducted other town halls via telephone and Facebook, and look forward to more in the future. Hearing from all constituents in the First District is an important part of the governing process, and I want to allow every East Tennessean the opportunity to let their voices be heard.    Finally, we had a number of questions from veterans about new opioid regulations at the VA. Opioid abuse is a national concern - and is prevalent in both the general and veterans populations - but some of the VA’s own practices have exacerbated this problem, such as an initial unwillingness to work with state prescribing databases. While there is no question the VA needed to take steps to curb opioid prescriptions for veterans whose pain may be able to be treated effectively without their use, taking away veterans' access to prescription medication without other options to manage their pain and close clinical supervision isn’t the answer either. That's why, as chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am working to examine our policies on pain management and to ensure additional treatment options are available to treat chronic pain. The No Hero Left Untreated Act was passed by the House just last week. This bill would create a pilot program to allow the use of Magnetic Resonant Therapy, an innovative, FDA-approved treatment for patients with mental health conditions and chronic pain. I will continue to conduct oversight on this issue to ensure veterans are receiving the care they need from VA and that VHA clinics and hospitals are doing their fair share to combat to the opioid epidemic.    I encourage you to check my website regularly for information on town halls and to email or call any of my offices if I can assist you or your family. I look forward to hearing from you soon.","status",NA,NA,21,21,4,0,0,0,1,4

During the month of August, the House Committee on Ways and Means is highlighting thirty-one reasons why we need tax reform.    There is no question we need to lower taxes for people at all levels of income, from our job creators to our friends and neighbors who have fallen on hard times. Excessive regulation and taxes are a deterrent to business expansion and income, and it’s time for Congress to act to ensure Americans can keep more of their hard-earned pay.
