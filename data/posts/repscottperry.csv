We all care about clean air and water; my point is that pollution occurs both naturally and from man-made sources; we need to be serious about cleaning it up – rather than over-regulating industries we don’t like and calling it the “only solution.” https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-12/documents/cbay_final_tmdl_section_4_final_0.pdf","link","https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-12/documents/cbay_final_tmdl_section_4_final_0.pdf","epa.gov",169,151,23,3,13,1,0,9

The replacement bill - the American Health Care Act, as currently written - repeals the individual mandate and the employer mandate, but fails to end government control of personal health care. The fundamental problem with the ACA was the government takeover of personal health care decisions. Until we address that key point, we’ll never get to the root of the issue of rising costs and providing people with greater choice and flexibility in their health care coverage. During my four years in Congress, more people than I can count have told me – repeatedly – that they can’t afford health care. We simply must get costs down, and that starts with removing one-size-fits-all federal mandates. Instead of trying to get this done quickly, let’s get it done right. I’ll continue to work with the President and my House colleagues to get a reasonable proposal through the House to repeal the ACA once and for all.”","status",NA,NA,222,178,33,10,3,0,2,13

The Articles of Confederation were the tenets that established the federal government following the end of the Revolutionary War, but were plagued with practical problems that posed numerous challenges for our fledgling Nation. To remedy these issues, our Founding Fathers called for the Convention. The Constitution, which governs us today, is still on display at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.

Any budget must balance protections for the taxpayer and those who are most vulnerable. While some of President Trump's budget requests fail to address key drivers of our $20 trillion debt and focus only on a small portion of the federal budget, he deserves great credit for submitting a balanced budget and prioritizing both the national debt and the annual deficits. His budget is projected to reduce deficits by $5.6 trillion over a ten-year period, resulting in a $16 billion surplus, and it drops our national debt from 77.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year to 59.8 percent by the end of the same time period. Despite the narrative being pushed elsewhere, the vast majority of programs impacted by this budget will see only a reduction in their rate of future growth - they’re not actually being cut.

Scott Perry","2017-05-24","2017-05-24 22:22:17","Representative Scott Perry (R-PA) offered the following statement in reaction to the Congressional Budget Office assessment of the American Health Care Act (AHCA):   “I’ve said from the beginning that this legislation is imperfect, and doesn’t go far enough to end the Affordable Care Act, but inaction wasn’t – and still isn’t – an option. The failed policies of the ACA are driving up the costs of both health care and medical insurance nationwide and the pace is unsustainable. A new Health and Human Services report shows that since 2013, premiums have increased on average nationwide by 105%. The CBO originally predicted that 21 million Americans would have ACA coverage in 2016; yet only about 10.4 million actually gained coverage. To avoid the ACA entirely, more than 19 million people either paid the penalty or claimed an exemption from the individual mandate. This new CBO report also confirms that the American Health Care Act lowers premiums and the deficit. Regardless, the Senate is working on its own bill, which will receive a new CBO score, and then we’ll conference an agreement with yet another CBO score – so this process has a long way to play out.”","status",NA,NA,66,87,13,0,0,1,2,34

I have a visceral disdain for the goals/actions of White Supremacists and Neo-Nazis - as I do for all hate groups.

The event in Charlottesville didn’t happen in a vacuum, and isn't the first type of incendiary riot rooted in hatred that we’ve seen recently - which, in and of itself, should be alarming to all Americans.  We can’t let our national discourse fall into the trap of picking and choosing sides to blame. We need to choose rational discourse, debate, agree to disagree, defend the First Amendment and compromise for the good of our Country.

The only safe way to look directly at the uneclipsed or partially eclipsed sun is through special-purpose solar filters, such as “eclipse glasses” or hand-held solar viewers. Homemade filters or ordinary sunglasses, even very dark ones, aren't safe for looking at the sun; they transmit thousands of times too much sunlight.   2. Don't look at the uneclipsed / partially eclipsed sun through an unfiltered camera, telescope, binoculars or other optical device. 3. Always supervise children using solar filters.

Growing up, we were flooded out of our home twice by severe storms, and I’ve seen the impact of other natural disasters on my own community.  I’m well aware it could happen again.  This issue deserved a vote on its own merits and I would’ve gladly supported it again; but the Senate attached several unrelated policy items to the bill that forced me to vote against the final package.  One of these items was an increase to our debt ceiling – which was provided without any corresponding spending cuts or other mechanisms to rein in our existing $20 trillion debt. I was hoping we could come together to have an open and honest discussion about how to address this crisis; instead, we again punted it down the road. As our debt continues to grow, we limit our Nation’s ability to respond to tragedies like Hurricanes Harvey and Irma – in addition to a host of other direct and related problems. We ignore this growing crisis at our Nation’s peril.","status",NA,NA,63,35,3,4,0,0,0,5

Reform is desperately needed to help small businesses drive down costs and create quality, family-sustaining jobs. By getting more “big government” regulations out of the way, we reduce costs for everyone and create the jobs we need - all while providing critical infrastructure services.

As promised, the Administration has reviewed security protocols for entry into the United States and is adjusting these policies, which includes setting baseline security standards for entry into the country. Most countries already meet these standards, but roughly 9 nations do not. The U.S. is providing those countries with approximately 50 days to develop a plan for compliance.

Scott Perry","2017-10-13","2017-10-13 19:22:15","You may have heard some recent media about me with regard to my votes and comments about aid to Puerto Rico that, apparently, need clarification.  I appreciate the opportunity.    Growing up, my family’s home was twice devastated by severe storms and flood. Throughout my military career, I’ve been involved with numerous emergency, disaster and humanitarian relief efforts here in the United States and abroad. I’ve seen firsthand the devastation and human suffering caused by these events. I also spent most of my childhood in poverty and know what it’s like to be forced to build a life without having much to build it with.   According to FEMA, more than $53 million has been sent to citizens in Puerto Rico, and more than $169 million for emergency work thus far. FEMA, working in coordination with other federal partners, has provided Puerto Rico with more than 7 million meals and 6 million liters of water to date. The U.S. is working around the clock to bring relief and to restore power, communications and water to Puerto Rico. FEMA, by design, is intended for disaster response and emergency management; they’re not capable of, nor are they equipped for rebuild and restructure missions.  In addition, other disasters/response missions are occurring simultaneously to which FEMA also must respond. I greatly appreciate and support all of these efforts.    Late this week, the House considered a $35 billion aid proposal; it included unrelated policy provisions that would’ve failed if considered individually, and it wasn’t even open to amendment or debate.  It’s unacceptable in a time of crisis for Congress to exploit the desperation of disaster victims.  I didn’t support the proposal. I support aid for Puerto Rico because I want to help mitigate the unimaginable suffering being endured by our fellow citizens; but we must make decisions of this magnitude in an open and transparent manner. Blindly dispersing tens of billions of dollars without public debate and tacking on unrelated items for political expediency is not only wrong, it’s not effective or fair to anyone.  We all wish this process could work faster. In its incessant desire to oppose everything that President Trump says or does, however, CNN attacked our response to the Puerto Rico crisis and alleged that we care more about Texas’ and Florida’s victims. The allegations were ridiculous and insulting, and I wasn’t about to let those comments go unchallenged. The exchange may have become heated, but it doesn’t change the fact that my life experiences have given me great empathy for the people of Puerto Rico and the loss and suffering they’re enduring.  As I’ve seen with my own eyes with natural disasters of this scale, federal resources are strained. The devastation is unprecedented and FEMA is spread thin confronting other disasters as well. Although we don’t have unlimited resources, we should do what it takes to ensure that our fellow citizens have the resources they need to recover and rebuild. Needlessly politicizing the issue for ratings and partisan gain is reprehensible and, most importantly, helps no one.","status",NA,NA,290,295,43,12,15,2,1,58

The first, H.R. 3329, Hizballah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act, which I cosponsored, increases the U.S. ability to sanction individuals or governments that supply money or other kinds of support to this terrorist organization. The second encourages the United Nations to recognize Hizballah as an International Terrorist organization. The third condemns Hizballah for its use of human shields, and gives the President additional authority to sanction foreign actors affiliated with Hizballah.  I’m encouraged by these actions, because earlier this year I joined with House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce to push for more scrutiny of the organization by the Trump Administration.

Our Tax Code was last updated more than 30 years ago; our world and economy have changed drastically since then, while the Code has grown increasingly outdated. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 helps us keep more of what we earn – especially for working families and small businesses, and it modernizes our Code to help American companies compete-abroad, create jobs right here at home and help bring back companies from overseas. I’ll support this bill when it comes to a vote today.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repscottperry/photos/a.379514205478207.86070.376801102416184/1691734757589472/?type=3",NA,96,132,4,14,3,0,2,60

Many concerns stemmed from changes in deductions for graduate student loan interest, medical expenses, and mortgage interest for homebuyers. It’s worth noting that the final version of the bill leaves existing benefits for grad students in place, expands the medical expense deductions and leaves the Mortgage Interest Deduction in place for homes which cost under $750,000. These provisions were restored in the Conference Report.

The tax credit is fully refundable up to $1,400. A refundable tax credit means you get to count the credit amount toward your liability (how much you owe the federal government), and then get extra money back if the credit is more than what you owe for taxes. It can mean that you and your family get money back from the federal government that you didn’t pay in. The bill also preserves the Adoption Tax Credit and the Dependent tax credit for families who help take care of an elderly parent or an adult child who is disabled.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repscottperry/photos/a.379514205478207.86070.376801102416184/1691890300907251/?type=3",NA,55,68,11,3,0,1,0,23
