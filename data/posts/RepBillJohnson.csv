In a meeting of Congressional Democrats on Wednesday, President Obama said he hasn’t done a good enough job communicating the benefits of his health law, which is why he thinks it is unpopular. I think he has communicated the ins and outs of the law just fine – people just don’t like it and know that it hasn’t lived up to its grand promises. Under Obamacare, healthcare premiums and deductibles are soaring, patient choices are dwindling, healthcare insurance markets are collapsing, and jobs and hours are being cut.  Making excuses like the President is doing is not honestly addressing the law’s failures.   According to a Gallup survey from November, a large majority of Americans want the law either significantly changed or replaced.  House Republicans are working with the Incoming Trump administration on a strategy to do just that.  Yesterday morning we met with the incoming Vice President, Mike Pence, on this topic and many others.","status",NA,NA,121,53,23,4,0,0,1,3

I voted YES for both bills.   By passing the Midnight Rules Relief Act (H.R. 21), the House acted to stop the Obama Administration from enacting more radical regulations that would cost the American people billions, and harm families and small businesses, as the moving trucks sit outside the White House.    The REINS Act (H.R. 26) would stop unelected bureaucrats in Washington from implementing job-killing regulations by requiring that Congress must approve any major regulations before they go into effect. The REINS Act would restore the checks and balances, and bring accountability to elected officials.

The American people deserve better and Republicans in Congress have been given a clear mandate to make that happen.  The only avenue to repeal ObamaCare is through the budget reconciliation process. Today’s budget resolution triggers the mechanism for using that process.  It’s important that we do this the right way – not through a 2,000 page bill, negotiated in a shady, backroom deal, and presented at midnight with a vote no more than two hours later. This process will be open, transparent, and visible to everyone.  It is critically important that the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare be done thoughtfully and carefully, as it will impact millions. The American people deserve a patient-centered health care system that offers more choices, better access, higher quality, and lower costs.  We must follow up the repeal with a suitable replacement; but, the current law cannot be undone without a transition period, because those currently on ObamaCare should not be subjected to unintended consequences.  This budget resolution I voted for today essentially fires the starting pistol to begin the process of repealing and replacing ObamaCare.

I’ve said it here before, and I’ll say it again: the importance of broadband connectivity in attracting jobs and retaining businesses cannot be overstated. If you don’t have high-speed internet connectivity in your community, it is a serious disadvantage in business development, education, and emergency communications. High speed internet access is no longer a “pie in the sky” luxury; rather, it is essential for everyday activities. It is estimated that around 15% of Ohio’s rural population still lacks access to high-speed Internet that meets what the FCC considers as “adequate.” This must change.

President Reagan taught us about leadership, and lessons about faith, freedom, liberty, and a strong, prosperous America. My favorite Reagan quote is: ""It Can Be Done!"", which is proudly displayed on my desk. President Reagan believed the best about the American people, and inspired us to listen to our best among us.  Like many Americans, I look back on his years in office fondly...he was uniquely and unfailingly optimistic -- whether staring down the Soviet Union during the Cold War, or dealing with former Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill and the Democratic party to adopt his economic agenda.  President Reagan was a giant among world leaders, and was one of our greatest presidents.

Without George Washington, there would be no Declaration of Independence, no Constitution, and no United States of America.  Not only was he elected unanimously once, it happened again when he ran for reelection.  That is unimaginable in today's politics.  The Constitution created the office of the President, but it was George Washington that created the presidency.  Of course, in addition to being our first President, Washington led the Continental Army to victory against Great Britain, the most powerful military in the world at the time. He also created the first military badge of merit for the common soldier. Revived on his 200th birthday, the Purple Heart is awarded to soldiers injured in battle. It seems about the only thing George Washington didn’t do was chop down that cherry tree.  After helping to found our nation, George Washington could have become king, but chose not to, saying ""I didn't fight (King) George III to become (King) George I.""   There were many giants among our nation’s founders, but few could argue that Washington was THE giant among giants.

Thousands of Americans made the ultimate sacrifice that momentous day - for a cause that was just - to advance the American cornerstones of freedom and liberty. All these years later, freedom loving people throughout the world remain eternally grateful.   With each passing year, there are fewer and fewer members of the WWII generation - the Greatest Generation - left to say “Thank You” to.  Not just for their service, but also for their work to strengthen America when they returned home.   In 2014, the President signed the WWII Memorial Prayer Act into law. I originally introduced this legislation in the House of Representatives, which authorizes the inscription of the prayer Franklin Roosevelt prayed with the nation the morning of June 6, 1944, “Let Our Hearts Be Stout.""

I have tremendous confidence in Secretary Mattis and his team, and I believe the American people can trust him to advise the President in developing a winning strategy.   Tonight, President Trump said, ‘We are not nation building again...we are killing terrorists.’ It's a message that our military and the majority of the American people have been waiting to hear. And, President Trump is correct on another point regarding Afghanistan's neighbor - it's time for Pakistan to step up in combating radical Islamic terrorism.  The bottom line is that Afghanistan can never again be a launching pad for radical extremism - too much American blood has been shed over the past 15-plus years to allow that to continue. After spending over 26 years in the U.S. Air Force, I know that we can't win a war while micromanaging from Washington D.C. - our history tells us this.

It is managed by its founder, Shelia Slezak, who has been training dogs professionally for over 30 years.    Once a dog is accepted into Shelia’s program, they are then matched up with a veteran based on their specific needs. Each dog and veteran team receive training together for two weeks on site before the dog goes to its new home. The entire program is done at no cost to the veteran – the program is funded through donations and fundraisers - which is amazing considering many organizations charge up to $30,000 to purchase a service dog.    You often hear people say that they won’t forget the sacrifice of those who served.

That’s not leaving much of a choice in plans for the American people – which was one of President Obama’s major promises when he signed Obamacare.

The bill, which I co-sponsored, would allow law-abiding citizens with a state-issued concealed carry license or permit to conceal a handgun in any other state that allows concealed carry. The individual would need to have a valid photo ID, a valid concealed carry permit, and cannot be federally prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm. Under this legislation, individuals would still have to follow all local laws—state, county and municipal — even if they differ from the state where they got the original permit.   H.R. 38 does not deal with access to weapons: it has nothing to do with the purchase of guns, access to guns, and doesn’t change federal background check laws.

I was contacted by his son-in-law, who wanted assistance in replacing these invaluable keepsakes.  One of the most special things I am able to do in my role representing you is helping those who wore, and continue to wear, the uniform. I was humbled to honor Mr. Cox for his service on behalf of the United States of America.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBillJohnson/photos/a.332690083424291.96790.170477096312258/2007848369241779/?type=3",NA,99,33,13,9,0,0,2,0

I signed onto a letter to the House and Senate Leadership that expressed my strong opposition to the repeal of the income exclusion for graduate tuition waivers, as it is an important tool for those furthering their education. The final tax bill WILL preserve this important middle-class tax break, along with the deduction on student loan interest.","status",NA,NA,98,51,11,0,4,2,1,8

For the first time in over 30 years, real tax relief and reform will be delivered. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will reduce taxes at every income level, double the standard deduction and child tax credit, and empower businesses to grow and hire more people.  Important deductions for home mortgage interest, student loan interest, and charitable donations remain. Most importantly, the middle class – hardworking Americans that are too-often left behind – will see tremendous tax relief. This legislation delivers higher wages, lower taxes, bigger take-home paychecks, a simpler and fairer system, and a stronger economy across the board.  Once approved by the Senate, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be signed into law by President Trump, empowering individuals, families, and businesses to invest and succeed in the American Dream.","status",NA,NA,159,107,7,12,3,1,0,45
