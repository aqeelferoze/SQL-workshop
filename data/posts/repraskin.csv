This divesting of the House's power to discipline its own Members is a response to last year's gun safety sit-in on the House floor and shreds the most basic notions of due process for legislators.

I objected to ten electors from Florida who are elected officials, including the Attorney General and multiple State Representatives and Senators, all of whom were in violation of the specific state ban on dual officeholding, which parallels the Constitutional prohibition against federal officials serving as Electors. But we had no opportunity to debate technical violations like this, strategic voter suppression, or the contamination of the election by Putin's cyber-sabotage for lack of a Senator joining us in the objection.

In 1981, as a college junior, I interned for Congressman John Conyers, Jr. on the Judiciary Committee and found there not only a lifelong mentor but a passion for constitutional law and a profound appreciation for the Judiciary Committee and the role that it plays in defending the rights and freedoms of the people. In 2016, with such profound disrespect for constitutional values being displayed by the incoming administration, the work of the Judiciary Committee is of surpassing and urgent importance. Here in this Committee we will take our stand for civil rights and voting rights, civil liberties and reproductive freedom, the rights of citizens and the rights of immigrants, criminal justice reform and access to justice for all.

In 1963 my parents marched on Washington and can be seen in this treasured Life Magazine photo with other marchers dangling their feet in the Reflecting Pool. Five years later, when my father, Marcus Raskin, was indicted in the Boston 5 anti-draft conspiracy trial with Dr. Benjamin Spock, Reverend William Sloane Coffin, Michael Ferber and Mitchell Goodman, Dr. King sent my father a telegram saying that if the defendants were guilty for speaking out against the Vietnam War then he was guilty too. The kids in my family grew up with the comforting knowledge that Dr. Martin Luther King was on our side. The dazzling career and commitment of Reverend King are a constant inspiration for our people and a lodestar for America.

But, as the hour approaches, I realize I cannot bring myself to go. I wish that these were normal times and that I could sit and applaud the normal workings of government. But these are not normal times and I cannot pretend as if they are. The moral and political legitimacy of this presidency are in the gravest doubt. I cannot risk my presence at Trump’s inauguration being interpreted as any kind of endorsement of his continuing business entanglements with foreign governments, his refusal to address the enormity of Russia's efforts to sabotage and undermine our democracy in 2016, his relentless trafficking in bigotry, misogyny, and fear, or his Twitter attacks on civil rights heroes, like my colleague Congressman John Lewis, union leaders and other citizens. I do not rejoice in this decision or take any pride in it any more than I would rejoice or take pride in going on Friday.

Jefferson knew that slavery was an egregious wrong but never broke from it and freed only a handful of his slaves. He was a lucid champion of science and the Enlightenment but also a politician who participated in racial myths and won the presidency on the strength of the three-fifths clause and the Dixie-accented electoral college.

These measures create a safety commission to assume effective safety oversight over Metro and allow for disbursal of millions of dollars in federal transit funds to Maryland, Virginia, and DC. We must redouble our efforts to get through our current problems with system safety, reliability and efficiency and to make sure that our more than 12,000 hard-working employees get the support they deserve. The Metro used to be the jewel of our region and it must be restored over time to its original grandeur. I remember in high school when Metro was completed--it was 1976 and it had a transformative effect on our region. Today it is the second largest subway system in America and takes two in five federal workers to and from work every day. Metro is also the way millions of Americans who come to visit the Nation's capital every year move around and get to see the White House, the Capitol, the museums and memorials, NIH, FDA, and so on. The Metro is thus critical, not just to the people who live and work here and make the federal Government and local economy function, but to all American citizens. Without it, our traffic gridlock would be impossible and indeed national security would be compromised. This is America's Metro and Congress must continue to work closely with Maryland, Virginia and D.C. to make the investments and safety and reliability reforms that will make Metro function in a way that makes us all proud again.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepRaskin/videos/1629021813777471/",NA,260,17,11,9,0,0,0,0

In the dead of night, three honorable Republican Senators joined every Democratic Senator to soundly reject the final absurd entry in the manic and clandestine campaign to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But let us be clear why we won: popular organizing and mobilization prevented this catastrophe from happening. Without the calls, the letters, the massive attendance at Town Hall meetings, and the creative non-violent protests all over America, the GOP machinery would have gladly thrown 32 million Americans and their health insurance to the curb, sharply reduced Medicaid spending for our people, destroyed coverage for preexisting conditions, put Planned Parenthood in a straitjacket, and transferred hundreds of billions of dollars up the wealth ladder to the most prosperous people and corporations in our society.  So thanks to all the resolute Americans, including so many Marylanders, who said no to each “mean” farce of a plan and to the secretive smash-and-run legislative “process” that made a pure mockery of our democracy. This final result was an important victory for popular organizing, but now we must rebuild common ground across the political spectrum to make essential reforms to the health care system.  We need to restore the government’s power to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies for lower prescription drug prices in the Medicare program—a power we already have in Medicaid and the VA.  We need to stabilize the Health Care Exchanges and lower premiums, co-pays, and deductibles.  We need to stop President Trump in his tracks as he continues his sickening efforts to sabotage the ACA from within. And we must work towards a system of quality health insurance coverage for all Americans, the kind of system that prevails in all the wealthy industrialized democracies of the world. ""Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered,” said the great Tom Paine in Common Sense, ""yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.” Hang tough, America.

Sounding like in-house counsel for the Alt.Right and essentially recanting the prepared statement against racism he read from the teleprompter yesterday, the President of the United States went back to aggressively blaming bad people on “both sides” for the mayhem of Charlottesville and, in the process, emboldened a grateful David Duke and the boiling cauldron of Klansmen, neo-Nazi skinheads and fascist anti-Semites planning their next moves against American democracy. While most Americans remember that we sent millions of Americans to fight Nazism and fascism in Europe in World War II and are resolved today to stop any further spread of the lethal racial terrorism on display over the weekend, Trump traffics in profoundly disturbing moral equivalencies that flatter the hate-mongers and nourish their dreams of Nazi-like race war. Trump equates torch-bearing and violent white supremacists, several of whom beat African-American counter-protesters nearly to death, with peaceful UVA students and Charlottesville residents, like my sister and her family, who braved the sea of out-of-town haters simply to stand up for their city and for basic American ideals. Trump defiantly equates the taking down of a statue of Robert E. Lee—a Confederate traitor to the Union who took up arms to kill patriotic Americans and a cruel slave master who oversaw the massacre of Black Union troops during the Civil War—with the hypothetical removal of statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, which no one is proposing anywhere (to my knowledge). Whatever their personal flaws and shameful complicity with slavery, Washington and Jefferson were Founding Fathers who helped to build the Union that General Lee, Stonewall Jackson and Jefferson Davis tried to destroy by killing hundreds of thousands of Americans. Washington led our forces in the Revolutionary War and unified the country afterwards. Jefferson founded the University of Virginia, championed freedom of speech and the separation of church and state, and wrote our Declaration of Independence which spelled out the founding and indispensable ideal that “all men are created equal.” No moral equivalency between Confederate traitors and Jefferson and Washington. No moral equivalency between people who march under the Nazi flag and those who defend the flag of freedom. But at least everyone knows which side Donald Trump is on now. Hang tough, America.","link","https://medium.com/@RepRaskin/statement-of-congressman-jamie-raskin-about-monuments-to-confederates-and-white-supremacists-ad3b068bcc06","medium.com",1267,153,384,132,2,6,33,71

I collected my interns and joined up with CBF President Will Baker, CBF Vice President for Environmental Protection and Restoration Kim Coble, and my House colleagues and fellow Bay fanatics Dutch Ruppersberger (MD-02) and Scott Taylor (VA-02) to do an all-too-brief but happily bipartisan environmental expedition on the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers led by a CBF Captain born on Smith Island and expert in our region. Following the same tour that CBF does for thousands of schoolchildren in our states, we learned about all of the most up-to-date purification technologies and got this bright news: our Rivers and our Bay are getting cleaner and stronger each year. The blue crab population, the oysters, catfish and many different kinds of fish, and our six main grasses are all rebounding. Although the Bay is far from being healthy, the indicators are pointed in the right direction and the Bay dead zone is shrinking. Above all, water clarity and purity are dramatically improving. All of this progress is the result of decades of progress in sewage management, acid rain legislation, strict pollution controls and agricultural, urban and suburban storm water runoff prevention and management. Given the fine progress we're making through government in bringing back our still-delicate and always precarious watershed ecosystem, it is a pity and a scandal that President Trump is proposing to pull the plug on our progress and simply delete all federal funding for Chesapeake Bay clean-up. So far we have successfully resisted this terrible idea and have kept federal dollars flowing into Bay cleanup. But there is a strong political undertow today as polluters infiltrate every nook and cranny of the Trump administration and push Congressional Republicans hard to the right. I just voted against a terrible GOP amendment to keep the EPA from spending money to enforce pollution limits in the Bay region; alas, this piece of special-interest legislation passed in the House. Democrats and a few Republican friends will continue to fight against the climate change deniers and special-interest polluters every day to defend a strong federal role in the Bay cleanup to complement what the states, the District of Columbia, CBF, River Keepers and many other excellent environmental groups are doing.

Jamie Raskin","2017-09-28","2017-09-28 20:03:25","UPDATE:  Three hours after we took to the floor with the SWAMP FLYERS Act, Secretary Price announced he'd repay some portion of the money for the private jets. Stay tuned.   Original post: The staff infection spreads! Hey friends—do you love to fly wherever you want to go at taxpayer expense on private charter jets? If so, I’ve got the perfect job for you—you can join the Trump-Pence Cabinet! Of course, only billionaires and multi-millionaires need apply, but if you have a taste for booking fancy private charter jet travel to your favorite destinations and charging your expeditions to hard-working American taxpayers (instead of slumming it with mere first-class or coach commercial travelers), this is the opportunity of a lifetime. But hurry because, in the real world, I have joined with my colleagues Rep. Ted Lieu, Rep. Ruben Gallego, and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal to introduce the SWAMP FLYERS Act to prevent the kind of rampant misuse of taxpayer dollars we have recently learned about by Trump’s HHS Secretary Tom Price, M.D. who has spent more than $400,000 of taxpayer money on privately booked premiere jets for his “business” travel that could have been completed for a fraction of the cost on commercial airlines or Amtrak. For example, how much do you think it should cost the taxpayers to fly a cabinet secretary round-trip from Washington to Philadelphia? If you said somewhere between $477 and $725 on United, you’d be about right. Of course, you could also show some civic respect and fiscal restraint by taking Amtrak for $72 from Union Station to Penn Station or the ACELA for a couple hundred bucks (and you do get a free ginger ale on the ACELA!). Travel on Amtrak was good enough for Vice President Joe Biden, and flying on commercial airlines was good enough for Price’s predecessors at HHS Sylvia Mathews Burwell and Kathleen Sebelius. But if you work for King Trump, the answer is this: Secretary Price reportedly chartered a private jet to get him back and forth to Philly from D.C. for a mere $25,000! And the flight he booked actually left for Philly from Dulles 5 minutes after the commercial flight that would have gotten them earlier and saved the taxpayers around $24,500. I know this is just the tip of the iceberg in the corruption flying around the White House and Cabinet but we need to pass the SWAMP FLYERS Act (yes, that’s what we call our “Stop Waste and Misuse by Presidential Flyers Landing Yet Evading Rules and Standards Act”) to address it. Under the SWAMP FLYERS Act, government officials can only book private jet flights for reasons of national security or if no commercially flight is available. Sound reasonable? http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/26/tom-price-private-jets-243176","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepRaskin/videos/1700997899913195/",NA,528,98,123,53,3,8,3,48

In one of the greatest honors I have ever experienced, Kasparov came to visit me in my Hill office today. We talked about the repressive policies of Vladimir Putin that are strangling Russia, Putin’s ceaseless efforts to promote chaos and authoritarian politics in Europe, Asia and the United States, and the urgency of strong democratic action all over the world to defend human rights and the rule of law. We also talked about chess as a way to train young people how to think systematically and strategically, a passion of mine for two decades. And, then, in a dream come true, I got to play the grandmaster of chess (and human rights) in a game of chess in my office. The chess column reporter for The Washington Times, David Sands, was there and recorded all the moves so you’ll be able to reconstruct the game if you like. But it was the thrill of a lifetime; my chief of staff, Julie Tagen, said that she could not have imagined me any happier than if I had gotten to play piano with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. The game lasted a stunningly long time (20 minutes, basically because it took me so long to move) but, as I succumbed to the inexorable, Kasparov made my day by saying that I was a “solid” player and “very good and imaginative for a Congressman""! He was accompanied by some great chess players and teachers, including my friend David Mehler of the U.S. Chess Center, Eugene Meyer (president of the The Federalist Society who I asked whether he had seen Justice Gorsuch speak yesterday at the Washington Emolument/Trump Hotel), Dr. Derrick Cogburn (Executive Director of the Institute on Disability and Public Policy), and a team of precocious chess players from Anacostia High School. We are inviting Kasparov back to the 8th Congressional District when we open the new U.S. Chess Center facility in downtown Silver Spring (hurray!) in 2018. Stay tuned, chess and freedom-lovers. And fear not because while Trump plays golf and Putin goes fishing, we’re playing chess and we’ve got Garry Kasparov on our side.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepRaskin/photos/a.1417935358219452.1073741830.1406085866071068/1701801416499510/?type=3",NA,325,33,30,62,1,11,0,0

We stand united as a people in sending our thoughts, prayers and solidarity to the hundreds of wounded victims of the Las Vegas attack, the bereft loved ones of the 59 people murdered, all the re-traumatized victims of gun violence from Sandy Hook to Charleston to Columbine and beyond, and Nevada's heroic first responders, blood donors and citizen volunteers. On the Hill, Speaker Ryan conducted a brief moment of silence on the House floor tonight and then was off quickly to other business. But this is no time for silence and it is no time for business-as-usual, such as the macabre GOP/NRA proposals to legalize gun silencers and override the laws of 50 states to allow a national conceal-carry regime because there just are not enough concealed guns out there. I was proud to stand today with Gabby Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly as they called on Congress not to stop with ""thoughts and prayers"" but to engage in serious legislative action for effective policy change. We in Congress must indeed work overtime and across the aisle to pass common-sense legislation to lower our obscene rates of gun violence, beginning with universal background checks on all gun purchases, a legislative proposal backed by upwards of 90 percent of Americans. Our people have simply had enough of this mad violence. Americans are 25 times more likely to die of gun violence than people in the 22 wealthiest countries, and these statistics have become a bloody reality for millions of our people whose lives are forever altered. Las Vegas isn't the first U.S. city to experience the terrors of a mass shooting but it should definitely be the last. Enough is enough.

After the appalling Las Vegas massacre and amidst the massive suffering that continues in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, GOP leaders today chose to bring to the House floor legislation to ban abortions for the 2 percent of American women who have them after twenty weeks (overwhelmingly for reasons of profound fetal health problems). I only had a minute to speak in opposition, so I couldn't focus on this twisted sense of priorities, but I told the story of my constituent Allie, who faced an agonizing medical predicament and was able to use her constitutionally protected rights to end her pregnancy. Under the new bill advanced by the GOP, Allie's decision would have been illegal and her doctor would go to federal prison for five years as a convicted felon. Shocking when you think about it, this relentless assault on women’s health care. I hope that my GOP colleagues show the same vehement passion they have for the anti-abortion cause when it comes to protecting 33,000 American lives being snuffed out every year by rampant gun violence and swiss-cheese gun laws. But don’t hold your breath.  In a week when we should be working together to pass a universal background check (favored by 9 out of 10 Americans), a ban on high-capacity magazines and military-style assault weapons (the kind we passed in Maryland in 2013), and a restoration of the power of the Centers for Disease Control to study gun violence as a public health epidemic, the only firearm-related bills that have been slated for floor action are the GOP efforts to legalize gun silencers in the name of preventing hearing loss (I kid you not) and overriding the laws of 50 states to allow people with conceal-carry guns in their home state the freedom to pack heat everywhere. This sounds to me like the Mafia’s legislative agenda: concealed weapons and silencers. Now we’re hearing the bills may be delayed by GOP leaders out of “respect” for the Las Vegas families. Really? Why? If these atrocious bills will make us all safer, bring them on and let’s vote now.  If not, they should be withdrawn permanently. Why don’t we have hearings and a real legislative process?","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepRaskin/videos/1705718649441120/",NA,650,139,232,16,0,18,81,184

The plan, of course, deals sweet payoffs to Donald Trump, the Tax-Avoider-in-Chief, and to his family. It abolishes the Alternative Minimum Tax, which is the only reason Trump paid any taxes at all in the one year we know of in which he actually paid taxes over the last two decades. The plan also abolishes the estate tax, which must make the Trump children and other billionaire heirs giddy with excitement, but this elitist proposal has nothing to do with the vast majority of Marylanders because it only applies to the richest one-half of one percent of the nation, a few thousand families. Meantime, the GOP ""plan"" knocks the daylights out of Maryland families because it wipes out the state and local tax deduction. This means that the Republicans not only want to give hundreds of billions in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in the country--blowing up the deficit and the national debt to record levels--but they want to impose taxes on taxes for the middle class, abolishing the federal tax deduction for the state and local taxes we pay for our schools, our roads, our public services. Hundreds of thousands of Marylanders are going to end up paying a lot more in federal taxes because of this cynical sleight-of-hand. For the fat-cat big-oil lobbyists who dine at the Trump Hotel and golf at the Trump golf courses, the GOP plan piles on tax break after tax break. For the working people of Maryland, it piles taxes on taxes.

It is a plan painstakingly prepared by the free-flying billionaire Cabinet of a billionaire President for the hard-pressed 1% of wealthiest Americans in our country. Yes, under the GOP plan, 80% of the total tax cuts will go to the wealthiest 1% of Americans, those who earn at least $900,000 a year or more. Got that? Fully 80% of the Trump tax cuts will go to people making more than $900,000 a year! Are you and your family in that rarified category of the “successful”?  If not, you may be one of the tens of millions of middle-class families who will actually have to pay more in taxes under the GOP plan. You see, if you come down to Capitol Hill, you will learn that middle-class people need to be taxed more to make them work harder while the richest people need to be taxed less to make sure they are not punished for being “successful.” So who benefits from this appalling scheme? Well, not to put too fine a point on it, President Donald Trump and his family do!  A New York Times analysis shows that Trump and his family are likely to save more than $1 billion under this plan. Of course, it’s impossible to know precisely how much President Trump will gain under this tax proposal, because he still refuses to release his tax returns, which is not only a radical breach of faith with the American people, whom he promised he would deliver his tax returns to if elected, but a radical break from past practice of presidents for the last half-century. In any event, the hard-working and public-spirited Trumps stand to gain hundreds of millions from the abolition of the estate tax, which now applies only to the richest one-half of one percent of Americans, and the repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax, which is the only reason that Donald Trump paid any federal income taxes at all in 2005, the one year we know of in which he paid anything in the last two decades. But here’s the best part of this “plan” for America: according to the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s estimate, it will add more than $2 trillion to the national deficit if we give these gargantuan sweetheart tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires. Two trillion dollars!  Whatever happened to the “deficit hawks,” like Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell and all my colleagues who have daily described our deficits and national debt as a moral and political crisis? Well, the deficit hawks have become deficit chicken-hawks and full-blown deficit-ostriches and deficit-peacocks. Strutting and clucking and squawking like big bad hawks when Barack Obama was president, they are now scurrying away and sticking their heads in the sand like ostriches although they may still parade around like deficit peacocks at election time.

America has learned of the first guilty plea by a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, who repeatedly lied to federal investigators about his extensive contacts with the Putin axis during the 2016 campaign for the purposes of collecting “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. We have also learned of a massive 12-count Grand Jury criminal indictment in the District of Columbia handed down against Paul Manafort (Trump’s former Campaign Chairman) and Richard W. Gates III for conspiring to defraud the United States, laundering millions of dollars in illegal cash, failing to file reports of foreign bank accounts, acting as agents for a foreign principal without registering with the U.S. government, and filing false and misleading statements.   As the shoes keep dropping and the truth about the venal and incompetent Trump clique comes to surface, we must remember as a country what we stand for and what we have lost. America was conceived in opposition to monarchy, theocracy, despotism, public corruption, and tyranny. Our Declaration of Independence asserted the equality of human beings, the primacy of human rights, and the necessity that government rest on the “consent of the governed.” We have struggled over the centuries to become a country that stands strong for democratic freedom for all.   Our Founders understood that private corruption goes hand-in-hand with public injustice. The corrupt deal-making by the Administration and the campaign have been accompanied by a series of entangling alliances with the most authoritarian and corrupt tyrants on earth, from Putin in Russia and Orban in Hungary to the Royal family in Saudi Arabia to Duterte in the Philippines. Last week I rose on the House floor to talk about how this chaotic and plutocratic Administration has squandered our moral authority in the eyes of the world and undermined the struggle for democratic freedom at every turn.

Under this principle, if I set up a factory with 1,000 jobs on Main Street, I pay full taxes on profits every year to the IRS, but if I locate the factory and 1,000 jobs in Mexico, Singapore, or Switzerland, I will pay ZERO taxes on the profits—forever! Where do you think most businesses and jobs will be located and relocated from now on, at home or abroad? This dreadful lobbyist-concocted idea slipped into the Ryan-McConnell tax plan is a dagger pointed at the heart of our already battered American manufacturing sector, as well as our beleaguered unions and working class majority.

That last question elicited a priceless grin from the Attorney General and a concession that the growing group of Trump criminal defendants may be hoist on their own “tough on crime” petard.

The statute clearly says that the Deputy Director—Leandra English—“shall” become the Acting Director in the event of the absence of the Director, and English took her rightful office today.  But Trump is determined to run roughshod over the law to replace her with Mulvaney, who has called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau a “sad, sick joke” and seeks to repeal its very existence. Since its creation in 2010, the CFPB has won back nearly $12 billion for the American people from predatory banks, credit card companies and other low-riding villains on Wall Street and the financial sector.  As the major public champion for consumers in America, the young CFPB is already a major success story for the middle class. This is why Trump and his billionaire cabinet are hellbent on destroying it.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepRaskin/videos/1765720280107623/",NA,555,67,97,45,0,2,2,17

Jamie Raskin","2017-11-30","2017-11-30 22:08:29","Since I entered Congress in January, there have been 397 mass killings by firearm in our country--that is, 397 gun-related massacres with four or more civilian casualties. Two of these mass killings have ranked among the ten worst firearm massacres of civilians in our history: the bloodbath in Las Vegas on October 1, which took the lives of 58 Americans and wounded more than 500, and the Sutherland Springs, Texas massacre which left 25 women, men and children dead. Thousands of our people have already lost their lives in 2017 and we have still a month to go in the year.   Well, yesterday, the GOP leadership in Congress finally decided to do something. A hearing on a universal criminal background check for all gun sales, a measure supported by more than 90% of the American people and by a majority of every political group? No. A ban on military-style assault weapons, such as the kind that was used to assassinate 20 schoolchildren and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut at point blank range? Nope.  A ban on high-capacity magazines? A closure of the gun-show loophole? A lifting of the outrageous ban on the collection of statistics about firearm-related deaths by the CDC? No, no, no.   Instead, they brought forward a bill in the House Judiciary Committee to override and wipe out state concealed-carry laws all over America with a dizzying plunge to the bottom, declaring that anyone who can get a concealed carry license in any one state will have the right to take it across lines into every other state. And several states essentially allow anyone—regardless of criminal record, domestic offender status, mental stability, age and maturity, addiction or firearms training—to get a concealed weapon which they may carry loaded wherever they please. So now the preening champions of state rights in Congress are proposing to destroy the laws of the people of Maryland and every other state to promote an obscene NRA-guided effort to allow more than 14 million holders of concealed-carry permits—many of whom have killed police officers and other Americans with their weapons—to roam free across state lines. What a travesty and a folly.    I spent more than seven hours in Committee yesterday trying to derail this speeding train—there was no hearing, of course, just a markup session and vote. But my GOP colleagues rammed it through on party lines.                Here’s a little bit of what I had to say against this outrage. Cheers to the awesome people from Moms Demand Action who stayed for almost half the markup to represent the mass majority of the American people. And thanks everyone for your support and encouragement during a tough day.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepRaskin/videos/1769633089716342/",NA,377,149,244,15,4,5,74,121

Climate change remains a civilizational emergency, and this proposal will not only spread greenhouse gas emissions but badly damage the public health in the short term. If the Fitzgerald Company in Tennessee and EPA villain Scott Pruitt have their way with this policy u-turn, more than 1600 extra Americans are expected to die prematurely from lung cancer, asthma, stroke, heart disease, lung infections and other respiratory ailments. Although this is a seemingly esoteric bureaucratic issue, the consequences of reversing the common sense 2016 standard are far from esoteric.

This utterly phony “reciprocity” bill actually tramples the laws of the vast majority of the states, destroys the real interstate concealed-carry agreements that 22 states have entered into, and jeopardizes the safety of our people. More than 1,100 Americans have died by concealed-carry gunfire in the last decade and the GOP, bizarrely, wants to open the floodgates and allow permit holders from the most permissive states to come to Maryland—and to your state too. That’s millions more guns in interstate travel. Oh, and they create a new cause of action against our police officers, including attorney fees, if someone thinks the police are taking too long to verify that they have a real permit. Can you imagine the fake IDs criminals will be using now as our officers will be rendered unable to act? Several major law enforcement organizations, including the Major Cities Chiefs Association, have weighed in on this nightmare of a bill to oppose it. You think our colleagues might have had a hearing on such a radical piece of legislation but the NRA-controlled GOP has done away with any respect for legislative process along with public safety.

Jamie Raskin","2017-12-12","2017-12-12 21:48:30","I can’t tell you how moving it was to join Democratic and Republican House colleagues, my extraordinary constituent Greg Simon-who led VP Biden's Cancer Moonshot Task Force-and health care advocates for the kick-off of the Congressional Cancer Survivors Caucus today. The purpose of our Caucus will be to unify across party lines to do whatever we can to prevent cancer, to improve the human environment, to expand the efficacy and availability of cancer treatment and health insurance, to aid and learn from survivors, and to end cancer in our time.   This is the way the legislative process should work. We can fight like cats and dogs during the campaign, but once we’re all in office, we should work together comprehensively, beyond party (which comes from the French word “partie,” a part of the whole), to advance the common good which we can recognize from our common humanity. The stories my colleagues told were both searing and inspiring.   You will recall that, back in 2010, when I was a State Senator and a professor of constitutional law, I was diagnosed with Stage 3 colorectal cancer. I did it all—radiation, chemotherapy, surgery, and ultimately veganism!—and was treated by some remarkable nurses and doctors from Johns Hopkins and Anne Arundel Medical Center who saved my life. Out of that experience I resolved to keep fighting for health care as a basic right for all our people. It’s scandalous that the wealthiest society in history compounds the medical misfortune of a bad diagnosis—and all of its attendant psychological, emotional, family and professional stress—with the hardship, anxiety and injustice of lack of insurance for millions of our people. It makes no sense to me.   My experience also strengthened my determination to make sure that (NIH) and the National Cancer Institute get the critical investments and funding they need to continue making breakthroughs against diseases like cancer.   Greg Simon, who is now President of the non-profit Biden Cancer Initiative, emphasizes developing patient-focused approaches to cancer research, care, and treatment. I look forward to fighting for dramatic progress with him and my colleagues, including Caucus Co-Chairs Reps. Mark DeSaulnier and Ted Poe, and fellow Caucus members, including Reps. Phil Roe, Doris O. Matsui, Kevin Yoder and Rick Nolan, whose daughter, Katherine, is a cancer survivor.

One problem: Mueller is not only a former FBI Director and two-time U.S. Attorney widely admired for his professional ethos but a Republican hired by another well-respected law enforcement official, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is also Republican. But President Trump has called Mueller’s investigation the “greatest witch hunt"" ever against a politician and said the FBI is “in tatters.” So the right-wing media and House Republicans are now campaigning to discredit Mueller and the Special Counsel investigation by whipping up hysteria about some private texts sent by FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was once on the team but was removed in the summer by Mueller. In the texts, Strzok calls Trump an “idiot” (which is hardly an original or uncommon observation), but he also calls Bernie Sanders an “idiot” and has even unkinder words for my friend Martin O’Malley. What’s the relevance of any of this? As I argue in this floor speech: nothing. It’s an irrelevant distraction and a transparent effort to lay the groundwork for firing Mueller.","video","https://youtu.be/MvOUq2rWRKY",NA,358,95,54,32,3,1,0,17

But the GOP has gathered around the absurd idea that Strzok’s personal texts infect the whole investigation with partisan bias, even though Mueller (a well-respected law enforcement official and a Republican) promptly removed him from the investigation when the texts surfaced back in the summer. Why do we even have these texts and why were they revealed to the Committee and journalists in a data-dump on the eve of our hearing?
