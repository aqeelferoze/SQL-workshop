Congressman Brad Sherman released the following statement in response to the report:  “The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director was handpicked by former Republican Speaker John Boehner, and recommended by Republican Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.  Meanwhile, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) is chaired by Republican Congressman Kevin Brady and Republican Senator Orrin Hatch.  “By 2018, according to the report issued by the CBO and the JCT, 14 million Americans will lose health care coverage as a result of the House Republicans plan to make America sick again.  By 2026, the Republican plan will increase the number of uninsured by 24 million compared to current law.  “Additionally, the Republican plan will increase average premiums over the next three years, and will substantially raise premiums for older Americans.  “Republicans can’t run from the facts or create alternative ones.  The proof is in the report.”","link","http://sherman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-sherman-hypocritical-for-republicans-to-run-from-cbo-report","sherman.house.gov",61,32,8,0,2,2,3,1
