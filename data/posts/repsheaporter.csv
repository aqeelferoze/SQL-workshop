As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I’m particularly concerned that this budget reflects an incomplete understanding of how we keep our nation safe. Since World War II, our international affairs budget has been key to maintaining stability around the globe, and cutting critical international aid and diplomatic funding would be disastrous for our national security.  This budget attacks many of the priorities that make our country strong, and threatens our world leadership in cutting-edge research, higher education, and economic innovation. To fight back, I’ll be speaking up for the New Hampshire jobseekers whose workforce training programs could be cut; the families awaiting a groundbreaking NIH treatment for a rare disease; the UNH researchers with grants that will allow them to improve the world; and everyone who cares about protecting the environment so our children can grow up safe and healthy.  Today’s budget would even eliminate programs that feed the hungry, including after-school nutrition assistance and Meals on Wheels. Contrary to the Administration’s outrageous statements at this afternoon’s press briefing, these programs do work, and cutting them is the exact opposite of ""compassionate."" I will not stand by while this Administration uses falsehoods to justify destroying vital support systems for our most vulnerable citizens. Today I will be sending the Trump administration just a few of the dozens of peer-reviewed studies that show Meals on Wheels improves seniors’ overall health and nutritional intake and reduces social isolation. This budget is yet one more example of President Trump turning his back on the very people he claimed he was there to help.  http://bit.ly/2nKbQ1D","link","http://bit.ly/2nKbQ1D","bit.ly",98,22,16,0,0,0,8,4

We discussed the cruise missile strike against the airfield that Syrian President Assad used to launch a chemical weapon attack against his own people.   The horrific suffering of the Syrian people is an urgent international crisis, and has been for years. The many war crimes the Assad regime has committed, including the use of chemical weapons and the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians, have no place in a civilized world.  While our military strike was measured and carried out to send a warning, the situation on the ground is very complex and requires an accompanying diplomatic and humanitarian strategy. That is why President Trump must reverse his plan to cut the State Department and humanitarian aid budgets, and work with the international community to help the Syrian people.   He must also come to Congress to obtain an Authorization for the Use of Military Force. As he himself tweeted in 2013, ""The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria."" As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I take Congress’s Constitutional responsibility to authorize the use of military force very seriously. I call on the Trump administration to immediately present Congress with a request for such an authorization along with a detailed strategy for success, just as I called on the Obama administration to do in 2013. The need for an AUMF is especially urgent in light of today’s comments from U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley that President Trump is ""prepared to do more"" in terms of military engagement in Syria.","status",NA,NA,54,8,6,0,0,0,1,0

It is my view that today’s testimony clearly indicates that President Trump tried to influence the director of the FBI regarding the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's connections with Russia. Regarding the President’s statement he hoped former Director Comey would let the Flynn investigation go, Comey said: ""I took it as a direction.""   In addition, today’s testimony further confirmed that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is unfit to lead our Justice Department. I first called for the Attorney General’s resignation after he committed perjury during his confirmation hearing by misleading Senators about his contacts with Russian officials. Today, former Director Comey revealed that he and his FBI colleagues expected the Attorney General to recuse himself from the Russia investigation for a ""variety of reasons,"" including reasons he could not discuss openly. Based on the information that is already public, and bolstered by today’s testimony, I continue to demand Attorney General Sessions’ resignation.   As I have said for months, Russian interference in the 2016 election is a gravely serious national security issue. Former Director Comey confirmed this in very clear terms, saying: ""The Russians interfered in our election during the 2016 cycle. They did it with purpose. They did it with sophistication. They did it with overwhelming technical efforts. And it was an active measures campaign driven from the top of that government. There is no fuzz on that. It is a high confidence judgment of the entire intelligence community, and the members of this committee have seen the intelligence. It’s not a close call. That happened."" A hostile government threatened our democracy, and I continue to call for an independent commission to fully investigate this interference and develop recommendations to ensure that such interference never happens again.   Finally, I commend James Comey and the Senate Intelligence Committee for ensuring that the American people remain informed as Congress performs its crucial oversight role.","link","http://apne.ws/2r6R02r","apne.ws",129,49,12,8,2,2,0,10

Ending Medicaid as we know it would set our state back in the fight against the heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioid crisis and put millions of kids, seniors in nursing homes, and people with disabilities at risk of losing their care.   Senate Republicans know the majority of Americans oppose their plan, so they wrote it in secret sessions and are now trying to rush it to a vote next week. Every person in New Hampshire who gets health coverage through the individual market, Medicaid, or the New Hampshire Health Protection Program will be affected by this bill if it passes. Even people with coverage through their employer aren’t protected because states could strip back requirements that plans cover essential benefits like hospitalization, prescription drugs, or maternity care.

A day that should be unimaginable feels like a nightmare our country keeps reliving. I am praying  for the victims and the families who have lost loved ones to the senseless violence in Las Vegas. But as a Member of Congress, I know prayers are not enough.  After 20 little innocents and six caring adults were gunned down at school in Newtown, Americans didn’t just grieve for the victims – they changed their minds about our gun laws. The American public now overwhelming supports common-sense measures, such as requiring background checks, that would make us safer without penalizing responsible gun owners.  That’s what makes Congress’s failure to address the epidemic of gun violence so ugly. I will never forget the day in 2013 that Congress came close to passing the most significant gun safety bill since 1986. But as the parents of children murdered at Sandy Hook looked on, a minority of U.S. Senators refused to stand up to the leaders of the National Rifle Association and voted against a bill to prevent criminals and the dangerously mentally ill from purchasing guns.  And it’s gotten worse since then. Earlier this year, President Trump and Congressional Republicans overturned a rule that outlawed gun sales to people who identified themselves as being mentally incapable of managing their own affairs. And House Republicans have reported a dangerous gun-silencer bill to the floor -- the so-called “Sportsmen’s Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act” -- which means they could call a vote on it at any time.  During his 2013 State of the Union address, President Obama memorably invoked the Sandy Hook families, saying: “They deserve a vote.” He was right. We cannot let the NRA drown out our voices. None of us want our families to live in fear. None of us want our first responders to live in fear. None of us want to wake up to news of another slaughter. We all deserve a vote.","status",NA,NA,217,117,31,9,1,1,50,24

This bill eliminates critical deductions that help working people, including the student loan interest and tuition deductions, and curtails the State and Local Tax deduction. It blows up the deficit, setting the stage for drastic cuts to federal spending on Medicare, Medicaid, education, infrastructure, and other crucial domestic programs. And I agree with Senator Marco Rubio that this bill’s failure to meaningfully expand refundable provisions that put money in working families’ pockets and that have strong bipartisan support, including the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, is a huge missed opportunity to grow and strengthen the middle class.   Meanwhile, the plan is loaded with provisions to help the wealthiest. It eliminates the estate tax, which only applies to estates valued over $11 million for heirs who are joint filers and will only be paid by an estimated 5,500 Americans this year. And it slashes the corporate tax rate claimed by larger businesses while actually raising rates for many small businesses, earning it opposition from the right-leaning National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB).   House Republicans’ tax plan isn’t just regressive – it’s enormously hypocritical. After subjecting our country to years of obstruction and brinkmanship over the debt ceiling and government funding levels as they claimed they cared about the deficit, House Republicans have now proposed a plan that would explode the deficit by $1.5 trillion or even more. They want to repeat the damage they did during the Bush era, when they drove up the national debt by $4.9 trillion. We’ve seen this rodeo before, and it was a disaster. In 2003, seeking a second round of tax cuts, Vice President Dick Cheney infamously said: ""Reagan proved that deficits don’t matter."" This year, House Republicans are again acknowledging that they only care about deficits when it’s politically expedient. ""It’s a great talking point when you have an administration that’s Democrat-led,"" said Representative Mark Walker (R-NC), chairman of the hyper-conservative Republican Study Committee.   I will never support a plan that exacerbates income inequality by giving away even more to corporations and individuals that are already favored by our tax code, and then, in the name of deficit reduction, asks working Americans to bear the brunt of draconian budget cuts to essential federal programs. In contrast to the closed process that yielded this unacceptable proposal, I will continue to advocate for an honest, bipartisan discussion on revenue-neutral tax reform that prioritizes tax relief for working families and small businesses in order to address our nation’s income inequality crisis.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/02/winners-and-losers-in-the-gop-tax-plan/?utm_term=.0f9b7fe1184f","washingtonpost.com",39,43,31,0,2,3,4,26

This is an attack on our economic security and on the fabric of our nation. House Republicans’ tax scam is loaded with provisions to help the wealthiest: it eliminates the estate tax, which will only be paid by an estimated 5,500 super-wealthy Americans this year, and slashes the corporate tax rate claimed by the biggest businesses. Meanwhile, it raises taxes on many middle-class families, and it sets small benefits for working families to expire in five years – while making cuts for corporations permanent. And make no mistake about it: these cuts will take money away from needed national security investments at this dangerous moment in time.  The House Republican tax bill axes deductions that help working people so it can give more to the wealthiest. For example, this bill eliminates the deduction for high medical expenses claimed by over 40,000 Granite Staters and the student loan interest deduction that helps people saddled with student debt. It even takes away the modest $250 above-the-line deduction I fought to make permanent for almost 20,000 New Hampshire teachers – while keeping the golf course tax loophole. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the plan would explode the deficit by $1.7 trillion, triggering automatic cuts to Medicare. We all know our tax code desperately needs reform – but those reforms need to help the working people who are already losing out under our tax code, not give even more to the wealthiest 1% and the biggest corporations. https://shea-porter.house.gov/media/press-releases/shea-porter-votes-against-house-gop-tax-scam","link","https://shea-porter.house.gov/media/press-releases/shea-porter-votes-against-house-gop-tax-scam","shea-porter.house.gov",136,78,44,2,6,3,23,58

The Internet has allowed the proud tradition of American ingenuity and entrepreneurship to reach every corner of the globe. Its openness has enabled a new generation of New Hampshire innovators to turn a bright idea and a laptop into a business. We can’t stand by as the FCC and big corporations steal our right to equal access.  https://shea-porter.house.gov/media/press-releases/shea-porter-statement-fcc-s-vote-repeal-net-neutrality","link","https://shea-porter.house.gov/media/press-releases/shea-porter-statement-fcc-s-vote-repeal-net-neutrality","shea-porter.house.gov",202,48,23,5,2,1,14,15

The Trump Administration must act now to provide emergency funding. Just yesterday, Serenity Place, the recovery center for the Manchester Safe Stations program where Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway staged a photo op earlier this year, entered receivership. New Hampshire urgently needs funding, not photo ops, from this Administration. When will President Trump confront this crisis as the emergency it is, instead of insulting our state and calling it a ‘drug-infested den’?","link","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/opioid-fentanyl-overdose-deaths-us-life-expectancy-drops-for-second-year/","cbsnews.com",16,34,10,0,1,0,9,4

After securing a tax giveaway for billionaires and big corporations, Speaker Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and President Donald Trump decided to run away from the responsibilities that come with governing by kicking the can down the road yet again, while failing to address the need for predictable funding for the military, children’s health insurance, community health centers, veterans’ health care, the opioid epidemic fight, and for disaster relief. House Republicans already gave themselves a three-month extension on funding the government, for which I voted yes, and then gave themselves another two weeks - but this uncertainty cannot continue indefinitely. It makes it impossible for our military and for critical government agencies to do their jobs.  Congress also failed to protect young people currently facing unfair deportation by including the bipartisan DREAM Act. I am appalled that House Republicans have yet again chosen to run away from their fiscal responsibilities to this country. They are neglecting the basic functions of government that their constituents erroneously trusted them to perform.","link","https://shea-porter.house.gov/media/press-releases/shea-porter-statement-house-continuing-resolution-vote","shea-porter.house.gov",207,109,26,12,9,2,4,29
