Because of the #ACA, nearly 500,000 Marylanders now know the financial security of health insurance and the uninsured rate has never been lower.   The GOP plan to repeal the #ACA will hurt poor and middle class families by putting insurance companies back in charge of health care, raising premiums, increasing the cost of prescription drugs, taking critical consumer protections and benefits away from the more than 150 million Americans with coverage through the work place, and eliminating the health insurance of 32 million people who have it today.   No law is perfect but my goal is to fix the ACA by lowering cost, expanding access and improving benefits.

The President said, “From now on, victory will have a clear definition: attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing al-Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over the country, and stopping mass terror attacks against Americans."" But we cannot commit more American lives without a real, conditions-based strategy to end a war that has gone on longer than any other in American history.

We must incorporate both our military and nonmilitary components to ensure the lasting security and stability of Afghanistan.   When I was in the Middle East earlier this year, I saw firsthand the tenacious effort and incremental progress our military personnel and diplomats have made in defeating al-Queda, ISIS, and the Taliban.
