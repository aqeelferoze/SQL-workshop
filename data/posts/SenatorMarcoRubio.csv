Dr. Martin Luther King’s legacy has inspired generations of Americans, and I’m proud the American people come together today in his honor.  As we reflect upon the positive change Dr. King’s work brought to bear in our society, we also remember a shameful era of widespread, systemic discrimination and inequality. Through peaceful, constructive protests and speeches, Dr. King implored our country to realize the full potential of a core American ideal: that all of us are created equal by God and endowed with inalienable rights. The movement he led was rooted in faith and moral clarity, and advanced by Americans who had the courage to stand in solidarity with him, even if it meant physical threats, injuries, and sadly, sometimes death.  Our nation has come a long way since Dr. King’s life was taken. This week we are reminded of just how true that is as our nation’s first African-American president leaves office, and no doubt others will come as our nation’s future unfolds. Even with this progress, in recent years we’ve seen tragic events in our communities result in further anguish and division among Americans. Dr. King’s legacy, however, teaches us that we can turn even the most painful forms of hatred into catalysts for forgiveness, love, and progress. Through Dr. King’s powerful words and the example he set with his life, we have a vision of unity and brotherhood that we must continue to pursue today, so that the America Dream becomes attainable for more people of all races than ever before.‎  On this day of service and remembrance, we honor and renew Dr. King’s calls of equal opportunity and justice, so that his indelible words are forever ingrained in the spirit of America.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorMarcoRubio/photos/a.186323451393027.42620.178910518800987/1534218789936813/?type=3",NA,1246,195,339,110,1,0,0,6

I also believe given the uncertainty surrounding the future direction of our foreign policy that a higher degree of scrutiny is justified in evaluating whoever is nominated to serve as secretary of state.   Our foreign policy is at its best and most effective when it is grounded in the moral principles and values that have defined us since our founding. President Reagan made democracy and liberty central to his foreign policy. He challenged the ‘evil empire,’ and he demanded they ‘tear down this wall.’    But today there are calls to move our foreign policy in a direction that views geopolitics as a series of deals to be made, even if they come at the expense of our values or require us to abandon our traditional allies. Therefore, my consideration of Mr. Tillerson’s nomination focused not just on his qualifications, but also on his views about the role of democracy and human rights in shaping our foreign policy.    I have no doubts about Mr. Tillerson’s qualifications and patriotism. He has an impressive record of leadership and the proven ability to manage a large and complex organization. What I focused on from the beginning is whether as secretary of state he will make the defense of liberty, democracy and human rights a priority.    I was encouraged by a number of his answers throughout this process. He acknowledged that Russia conducted a campaign of active measures designed to undermine our elections. He stated that Russia’s taking of Crimea was illegal and illegitimate. He affirmed that our NATO ‘Article V commitment is inviolable.’ He endorsed the Magnitsky Act. He accurately characterized the conflict in eastern Ukraine as a Russian invasion, and he supports providing defensive weapons to Ukraine.   However, his answers on a number of other important questions were troubling. He did not condemn Russia’s repeated violations of the Minsk II agreement. While he condemned Russia for ‘supporting Syrian forces that brutally violate the laws of war,’ he refused to publicly acknowledge that Vladimir Putin has committed war crimes. Despite his extensive experience in Russia and his personal relationship with many of its leaders, he claimed he did not have sufficient information to determine whether Putin and his cronies were responsible for ordering the murder of countless dissidents, journalists, and political opponents. He indicated he would support sanctions on Putin for meddling in our elections only if they met the impossible condition that they not affect U.S. businesses operating in Russia. While he stated that the ‘status quo’ should be maintained for now on sanctions put in place following Putin’s illegal taking of Crimea, he was unwilling to firmly commit to maintaining them so long as Russia continues to occupy Crimea and eastern Ukraine.    Human rights violations in China, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia are well documented in the latest annual Human Rights Report produced by the State Department, but Mr. Tillerson testified he ‘would need to have greater information’ before acknowledging them, and said he would not rely on ‘what I read in the papers.’ Identifying certain actions as human rights violations is an integral part of the secretary of state’s job, but Mr. Tillerson implied that speaking out on human rights would hinder his ability to do his job as the nation’s chief diplomat.   Mr. Tillerson is likely to have a potentially unprecedented level of influence over the direction of our foreign policy. I remain concerned that in the years to come, our country will not give the defense of democracy and human rights the priority they deserve, and will pursue a foreign policy that too often sets aside our values and our historic alliances in pursuit of flawed geopolitical deals.    But in making my decision on his nomination, I must balance these concerns with his extensive experience and success in international commerce, and my belief that the president is entitled to significant deference when it comes to his choices for the cabinet. Given the uncertainty that exists both at home and abroad about the direction of our foreign policy, it would be against our national interests to have this confirmation unnecessarily delayed or embroiled in controversy. Therefore, despite my reservations, I will support Mr. Tillerson’s nomination in committee and in the full Senate.   However, upcoming appointments to critical posts in the Department of State are not entitled to and will not receive from me the same level of deference I have given this nomination.","status",NA,NA,1650,6058,1113,87,25,50,342,2278

Students’ potential shouldn’t be limited because their zip code condemns them to attend failing schools.  But for far too long, Washington bureaucrats and politicians—many of whom are beholden to big labor union special interests—have trapped children in failing school systems. Many of these same bureaucrats are able choose a quality school for their children, but prefer to deny other families the same freedom to choose better educational opportunities. Fortunately, we’ve recently seen greater bipartisan support of school choice, but more work remains to be done.  Just recently, the Florida Supreme Court threw out a frivolous union-led lawsuit against school choice—an important win for Florida’s kids and parents. During my time in the state and federal government, I have fought to ensure every child has the same opportunity to get a quality education. I recently introduced the Educational Opportunities Act, legislation that would offer tax credits for donations that fund scholarships to low-income students, thus giving more of our kids greater opportunities to succeed.  I will continue to push for reforms that expand school choice and opportunities in education and level the playing field for all kids throughout Florida and the nation.

And we are uneasy about the potential impact of these measures on our military and our diplomatic personnel abroad, as well as those who put their lives on the line to work with us.   We are both committed to doing what we must to keep America safe. We are equally committed to the defense of religious liberty and our tradition of providing refuge to those fleeing persecution. Like so many Americans, we are both guided by our belief that when we stand before our Creator to face judgment, He will say that “to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, even the least of them, you did it to Me.""   That is why we intend to do all we can to both keep America safe, and keep America special.","status",NA,NA,2913,1348,733,221,9,10,16,225

By all accounts he has the right temperament and experience for the job, and I’m pleased to see him nominated to serve on the U.S. #SupremeCourt. Most importantly, he is committed to the principles of original intent and judicial restraint. This is critical, because too many in the federal judiciary today believe it is appropriate for judges to invent new policies and rights instead of interpreting and defending the #Constitution as it is written.  Unfortunately, Senate Democrats already announced they would oppose any Supreme Court nominee no matter who it is. This obstruction is neither principled nor reasonable, considering we just had an election where the future of the Supreme Court was a central issue not only at the presidential level but in every Senate contest. On the issue of this Supreme Court nomination specifically, the American people gave the president and the Republican-controlled Senate a mandate to choose a successor to Antonin Scalia. Senate Democrats should accept the results of the election and allow the process to move forward with a vote. I look forward to a fair and thorough confirmation process, and I am confident Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed by the Senate once again, this time to serve on the Supreme Court.","link","http://bit.ly/2jTAAp9","bit.ly",5413,618,358,376,3,12,10,194

The Falcons have explosive yard average catch receivers who can find spots in that zone and break it for chunk plays. And the Patriots secondary suffers from mediocre tackling.

While I am disappointed that the secretary of state did not personally present the latest report, this report remains a critical tool for the U.S. to shed light on foreign governments’ failure to respect the fundamental human rights of their citizens.  Through actions and statements, American officials must send an unmistakable message to dictators and dissidents alike: protecting human rights is a priority for our nation. America's commitment to these principles stem from our own founding, and a belief in the inherent dignity of every man, woman and child. It is the proper role of government to uphold and protect those God-given rights, not trample them.  A cursory glance at the latest report's executive summaries reveals no shortage of grievous human rights violations in every corner of the globe that demand the attention of U.S. policymakers. Under Putin’s authoritarian rule, Russia has squelched freedom of expression and the press. The Putin government continues to pass draconian laws targeting civil society and any organizations or individuals critical of Putin. In China, the government’s severe pattern of repression and coercion continues as it cracks down on non-governmental organizations (NGOs), imposes limits on having children, and jails dissidents. Iran’s theocratic regime is an egregious violator of human rights, systematically using execution, torture, violence, unlawful detainment, harsh restrictions of civil liberties and basic freedoms, and other abuses to silence political opponents and minority groups.   In our own hemisphere, although Fidel Castro died last year, his authoritarian grip on Cuba lives on under the rule of Raul Castro. The Castro regime restricts the Cuban people’s access to the internet and media outlets, and refuses to recognize independent human rights groups. Politically motivated arrests and harsh prison conditions are the norm for those fighting for freedom on the island, where cases of detentions have increased from 2015. The Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White) reported weekly detentions of its members. In Venezuela, the Maduro regime’s abuses include indiscriminate and violent actions against civilians. The country is on the brink of becoming a failed state. Foro Penal, an NGO, has documented more than 138 cases of torture in the country between February 2014 and May 2015.   For the last eight years, the Obama Administration's “lead from behind” foreign policy, unenforced ""red lines,"" and hastiness to cut deals and normalize relations with regimes antithetical to everything America stands for came at a great cost. The lingering effect of these policies has been to hand over a world to the new administration in which our allies are disheartened and our adversaries are empowered and emboldened. American leadership in defense of basic human rights, on behalf of those whose voices have been silenced, is needed now more than ever.   As I stated during Secretary Tillerson’s confirmation hearing, political prisoners in China, dissidents in Cuba, girls who want to drive and be a part of Saudi Arabia’s society, and countless others around the world look to the U.S. and often to the secretary of state specifically for signs of where we stand, whose side we’re on, and how strongly we will back up our words with actions.

The 125th Fighter Wing is one of the five remaining installations being considered for basing the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Earlier this year, I urged the secretary of the Air Force to consider the capabilities and quality of life the 125th would offer the new F-35 and its personnel. Jacksonville is an ideal location for this fifth-generation fighter and its personnel due its existing infrastructure, facilities, and Florida’s ideal flying weather. Furthermore, the Jacksonville community has a proven record of supporting the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. military as a whole, and making our men and women in uniform feel at home.   Touring the 125th and meeting the guardsmen and women there, I saw firsthand the work Florida’s Air National Guard does to protect our nation.

Over the past two decades especially, our military, security and judicial cooperation has helped make Colombia a 21st century success story, where the rule of law has been restored, the economy is flourishing, and narco-terrorist violence has subsided. These achievements belong not only to the Colombian people who sacrificed the most blood and treasure, but also to the American people who supported Colombia and often stood side by side with them in their battles.   Whereas #Colombia was once nearly a failed state ravaged by drug cartels and terrorist groups like the FARC, today it is one of our main trading partners in the region. Whereas Colombia once relied on U.S. military assistance to survive, today Colombia’s military has a leadership role in training and equipping the militaries and national police agencies of other countries in the region that are being ravaged by drug cartels. Colombia’s example offers all these other countries hope that they too can overcome narco-terrorism.   During my meeting today with Juan Carlos Pinzon, Colombia’s ambassador to the U.S., I reiterated my strong interest in advancing policies that allow our two nations to further strengthen our bond. This is especially important following Colombia’s recent peace agreement with the FARC, and in this new era of American politics where every penny of foreign assistance is being reviewed to ensure we are assisting our allies and making the American people more secure and prosperous.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorMarcoRubio/photos/a.186323451393027.42620.178910518800987/1603926339632724/?type=3",NA,366,112,38,25,1,2,0,12

I stressed to our Lebanese partners the importance of cracking down on the terrorist group Hezbollah. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and I were sponsors of the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act, which was signed into law in 2015. This law blocks the terrorist organization’s financing and limits its access to logistical support. Prime Minister Al-Hariri and I discussed ways to address Hezbollah's threat to regional stability, and the necessity of helping to build the capability of the Lebanese Armed Forces to confront terrorist threats.  As always, I continue to be impressed by the work of Americans who serve abroad in our Beirut embassy and throughout the world as members of the Foreign Service. It is critical that we support their work in advancing our interests, as well as the goals of our international assistance programs.   I was also honored to visit the Beirut Memorial, a tribute to the 241 U.S. service personnel, including 220 Marines, who lost their lives in the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing.

This was my second visit to Israel as a senator and my third overall, and it was an honor to return with three other Senate colleagues. From the moment one sets foot in Israel, the evidence of freedom, progress and tolerance are evident everywhere, as Israel continues to be an oasis of democracy and free enterprise in a tumultuous region plagued with difficult security, foreign policy and economic challenges.  Upon arrival, I visited the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, where I look forward to soon seeing David Friedman confirmed by the Senate and working hard to restore the U.S.-Israel relationship. Later, we visited the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, where I was briefed by U.S. Consul General Donald Blome.‎ In both venues, we met with American foreign service personnel to discuss the state of U.S. international programs operating in Israel and throughout the region, the military and intelligence cooperation between our two nations, our robust economic ties, and the ongoing threats our ally faces from Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas and other hostile actors in the region.  Israel remains a shining example of what free people can accomplish anywhere in the world, and the impact that unwavering American support and smartly targeted U.S. international assistance can have in advancing our interests and values abroad. As a senator,‎ further strengthening the unique relationship between the U.S. and Israel remains one of my highest priorities.  As a Christian, visiting the Holy Land where Christianity began is an awe-inspiring experience. It is also a reminder of Israel's embrace of religious freedom while remaining steadfast to its founders' promise to forever be a Jewish state. I prayed for our two nations, for Israel's future, for our alliance, and for people everywhere to be able to live in peace and free from threats like those we continue to see abroad from Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas, and at home against Jewish Community Centers in the U.S.  May God bless Israel, may God bless the United States of America, and may God always watch over our close alliance.","status",NA,NA,780,239,86,97,2,2,0,19

Many have already died. The problem is most acute in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen, where a diverse range of factors in each nation—most of them man-made—have led to widespread famine, malnutrition, sickness and death. On Sunday night, CBS 60 Minutes provided a heartbreaking glimpse into the humanitarian disaster currently unfolding in South Sudan (watch it here: http://cbsn.ws/2mPS83q).   Late yesterday, I met with Bill Gates of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to discuss the future of America’s international affairs budget, the life-saving work America must continue doing to combat HIV/AIDS and other global health priorities, and our nation’s role in mitigating today’s global starvation crisis. America is already the top donor to the United Nations World Food Program, the world’s leading humanitarian relief effort on food crises. In fact, the American people’s generosity through this program is two-and-a-half times more than the number two donor, and roughly the same as the next three donors combined. Sustaining our support, demanding greater accountability to ensure every dollar in food aid is actually helping people in need, and asking more from our international partners is critically important. Additionally, we must continue to fund U.S. global health programs that are making strides every year in establishing a healthier global community. HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases leave many around the world unable to participate and contribute to their society. As we have seen in recent years, global health has direct consequences on American interests. We must remain engaged on these issues to ensure all people have a chance to live out their God-given potential and are not held back by preventable and curable diseases.    As the Gates’ foundation demonstrates, individuals, non-governmental organizations and the private sector also play a critical role in addressing human suffering. While Obama Administration-era tax proposals targeting charitable giving are no longer a concern, when Congress debates the issue of tax reform in the near future, we should re-evaluate our laws and regulations to make sure they are not discouraging Americans from giving to charities that serve our local communities here at home, as well as people in need abroad.     America has demonstrated our ability to not only win wars against brutal enemies, but then do the necessary things to secure lasting peace. Throughout our history, we have seen the unrivaled might of our military arms, but also the generous heart of our people. We have also seen the strategic value of targeted U.S. assistance that helps people and alleviates suffering while also serving our national security and economic interests.   Foreign assistance is not charity. Time and time again, we have seen that where America fails to engage or allows power vacuums to emerge unchecked, chaos and misery often ensue. When we fail to lead, the price of engaging later is often significantly higher.    I appreciate Bill and Melinda Gates’ commitment to these efforts and all the time and funds they have personally invested in making this their life’s work. As we move forward, I will be working with my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee to ensure that the international affairs budget advances our interests and represents our values.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorMarcoRubio/photos/a.186323451393027.42620.178910518800987/1615004581858233/?type=3",NA,822,226,108,51,0,2,9,16

Until those responsible for these attacks are brought to justice, the U.S. should immediately expel an equal number of Cuban operatives, downgrade the U.S. embassy in Havana to an interests section, and consider relisting Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism.","link","http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article176081581.html#emlnl=Breaking_Newsletter","miamiherald.com",1045,271,194,46,2,31,15,88
