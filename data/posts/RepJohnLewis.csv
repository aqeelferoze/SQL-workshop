Dr. King taught us to recognize the dignity and worth of every human being. He was the moral compass of our nation. He marched for us. He protested for us. He went to jail for us. He gave his life for us. We honor Dr. King’s legacy through service to our community and adherence to the philosophy and discipline of nonviolence. Our nation has, at times, created and enforced unjust laws. It is up to people of conscience to expose such injustice through nonviolent means.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJohnLewis/photos/a.10150906420278405.438298.82737208404/10154820638058405/?type=3",NA,53434,2778,20330,12765,19,25,338,16

Apparently, they had visited relatives who remained in their native land, and one day after an executive order issued from the White House blocked access to this country, lawful permanent residents have been detained.  People immigrate to America because they are inspired by our commitment to justice and democracy.  To treat as strangers these law-abiding immigrants, to whom we as a nation have seen fit to grant permanent status, is a stain on the integrity of our country and threatens the democratic principles this nation stands for.  This is a dark hour for America.  We must all be vigilant in this time and work persistently without ceasing to ensure that fairness, freedom, and justice prevail in the United States of America.","status",NA,NA,21548,1017,5873,820,10,122,3901,3508
