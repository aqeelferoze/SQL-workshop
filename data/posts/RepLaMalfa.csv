Thank you President Trump for your prompt approval of these much needed declarations. I appreciate his acknowledgement of our California Delegation letter of request as well as the Governor's request.   THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE February 14, 2017   President Trump Approves California Emergency Declaration                                                                                          The President today declared an emergency exists in the State of California and ordered Federal assistance to supplement State, tribal, and local response efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from the potential failure of the emergency spillway at Lake Oroville Dam beginning on February 7, 2017, and continuing.   The President's action authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, to coordinate all disaster relief efforts, which aim to alleviate the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population and to provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures. These relief efforts are authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act to save lives, to protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in the counties of Butte, Sutter, and Yuba.   Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide, at its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the effects of the emergency.  Emergency protective measures, limited to direct Federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent Federal funding.    Robert J. Fenton, Acting Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Timothy J. Scranton as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.","status",NA,NA,1188,259,1213,100,0,18,2,4

Insurance providers are pulling out of the exchanges, premiums are continuing to skyrocket, and choices for Americans are dwindling – and it will only get worse. From my very first day in Congress, the constituents of Northern California have pleaded that we get this law repealed and replaced with something that actually works for them. We also know that there will be no help from Democrats, forcing us to use the budget reconciliation process which requires only 51 votes in the Senate as opposed to 60 - Republicans have 52 votes. Without budget reconciliation, this bill would need 60 votes to pass and would be dead upon arrival in the Senate – sticking Americans with the high costs of Obamacare for another year. This was our one and only shot to get this done using the budget reconciliation process. The rules of reconciliation force the House to be cautious not to exceed parliamentary guidelines, but the Senate will have significantly more flexibility in their own chamber to test parliamentary limits. Simultaneously, we passed legislation today that will ensure Members of Congress and staff are subject to the same healthcare options as the constituents they serve. The bill protects some of our most vulnerable by ensuring under no circumstance can people be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. In fact, it keeps in place many of the current patient protections, such as barring insurance providing from increasing premiums based on health status or gender, while also keeping in place guaranteed issue and renewability, essential health benefits as the federal standard, and the right of dependents to stay on a family plan up to age 26. While States have the option to apply for waivers from certain regulations that increase premiums, the bill makes clear that no State or provider can deny an individual with a pre-existing condition access to health insurance. This bill is not a finished product, but more work will be done in the Senate as well as concurrence on amendments in the House. Constructive input is still welcome, but doing nothing is not an option. The American Healthcare Act is a positive step that will ultimately return the freedom of choice back to the patient.","link","http://lamalfa.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/house-passes-american-health-care-act","lamalfa.house.gov",325,921,117,28,7,5,14,443

The repeal of this mandate is nothing short of a victory for private property rights across the country. Many in California’s first district have expressed their frustrations with this rule, such as California farmer John Duarte, who faces millions of dollars in fines under this rule – simply for plowing his fields. We have more work to be done, but I am thankful President Trump and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt have shown a commitment to fighting this type of over-burdensome regulation that was indicative of the previous administration’s power grabs.","link","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/06/27/epa-moves-to-nix-obamas-waters-us-regulation.html","foxnews.com",201,60,41,27,0,2,4,57

Unlike today, we had no fighter jets on call to patrol the skies at a moment’s notice. Before United 93 was brought down in a field by the heroic passengers on board, there is a lesser known, lesser spoken story of courage and valor. Lt. Heather ""Lucky"" Penney, an Air Force F-16 pilot, was fully prepared to prevent that plane from reaching its target. But her F-16 was armed with no ammunition and no missiles - her plane was the missile. it was a suicide mission, but one she was willing to take on without hesitation. Her father, John Penney, was a retired Air Force pilot who served during Vietnam and was a United pilot that day. He could well have been in the rotation of flying Flight 93, a possibility Heather was well aware of. But it did not change her mission. It turns out he was not in the cockpit of that particular plane, but Heather had no way of knowing. Both Heather and the passengers aboard United Flight 93 are a testament to why our nation, while it might be bruised or bloodied, will never be defeated by acts of terror by any power.

This sends a strong message that the U.S. is committed to achieving peace in the region and will not be bullied by terrorism or threats of violence. Both houses of Congress voted overwhelmingly to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in 1995, and this declaration is simply a long-overdue affirmation of that law. Recognizing the sovereignty of one of our strongest allies is a smart decision, and one that will ultimately allow for more stability in the region.","link","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/06/trump-officially-recognizes-jerusalem-as-israels-capital-orders-us-embassy-move.html","foxnews.com",242,184,34,52,2,4,6,95

This surprise attack was meant to cripple the U.S. Pacific Fleet before entering the war, and President Roosevelt correctly labeled it as “a date which will live in infamy.” In the end, it was the determination and fighting spirit of the American military, along with the cohesive American spirit of innovation and amazing war material production that ultimately won the war.
