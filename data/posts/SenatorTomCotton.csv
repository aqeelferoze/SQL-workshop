Apple could have leveraged its position to push for more openness in China, but it instead sought to protect its market access at the expense of liberty. Apple's protestations that it's merely complying with Chinese law ring hollow when, just last year, it openly challenged a U.S. court order to assist a terrorism investigation and unlock the iPhone of a dead ISIS terrorist. The common theme running through Apple's actions is not principle, but short-term profit. And the ultimate consequence will be a future that is more closed, less prosperous, and much darker.","link","https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=571","cotton.senate.gov",327,71,78,2,8,8,27,41

This disgraceful breach of custom is especially surprising since Senator Booker just last year said he was “honored to have partnered with Senator Sessions” on a resolution honoring civil-rights marchers. Senator Booker says he feels compelled to speak out because Senator Session wants to keep criminals behind bars, drugs off our streets, and amnesty from becoming law. He’s welcome to oppose these common-sense policies and vote against Senator Sessions’s nomination, but what is so unique about those views to require his extraordinary testimony? Nothing. This hearing simply offers a platform for his presidential aspirations. Senator Booker is better than that, and he knows better.","status",NA,NA,2388,678,1303,38,20,29,67,314

Then they’ll stick the flag firmly into the ground and squarely in the center. It’s painstaking work.

President Trump is right that this amnesty would never have stood up in court. Yet, we now face a situation where 800,000 people, who were brought to our country as minors, face legal limbo. Dealing with this problem is a legislative task, not an executive-branch task. But we must recognize that codifying the DACA program will have two negative consequences: encouraging future illegal immigration with minors and allowing those 800,000 people to obtain legal status for their family members via chain migration, which rewards the very people who broke the law in the first place and further depresses working-class wages. Thus, we must mitigate these consequences by stopping the chain migration that hurts the working class and by strengthening the enforcement of our immigration laws. I've introduced legislation, the RAISE Act, that would limit the amount of low-skilled immigration coming into our country, and my colleagues have several proposals to strengthen enforcement. These should be the starting point of our discussions, and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to come up with a deal that protects American workers.","link","https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=775","cotton.senate.gov",3399,1288,880,380,14,16,42,750

Living with a nuclear-armed North Korean regime whose main interest is its own preservation is dangerous enough. Living with a nuclear-armed Iranian regime whose main interest is the export of Islamist revolution and terrorist chaos would be catastrophic. The United States should lead an effort among free nations to deal squarely with the malicious designs of the ayatollahs.

For 30 years, Americans have rejected repeated attempts to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants because they know what will follow: pressure on working-class wages, pressure on public schools, and pressure on welfare dollars. A standalone DACA amnesty will also be rejected if it is not combined with legislative reforms that lessen those consequences and produce lasting gains for all Americans. President Trump yesterday pointed to the RAISE Act-a bill I introduced with Sen. Perdue-as a starting point for negotiations, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to producing a legislative deal that the president can sign.","link","https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=779","cotton.senate.gov",1214,257,119,104,4,3,5,128

The fact that we've had to withdraw over half of our diplomatic personnel from Cuba only two years after reopening our embassy there shows just how untrustworthy and malicious the Castro regime is. It was foolish of President Obama to open his arms to such a brutal, Marxist regime.

This bill will provide the first real relief our community banks have seen since Dodd-Frank was passed into law seven years ago. It was wrong for them to pay the consequences of a financial crisis they didn't create, and granting them relief will mean more small-business loans and mortgages for Arkansas families. I'm also pleased that the final package includes my bill that protects consumers who take out residential PACE loans. It's well past time that we require the same disclosures for PACE loans that we do of other loans, and I'm glad to see us demand the accountability working Arkansans deserve.","link","https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=821","cotton.senate.gov",212,97,20,17,3,1,2,38

It's clearer than ever before that these damaging cuts to our military must be reversed, and they would've been, if Democrats hadn't blocked a vote on my NDAA amendment to eliminate sequestration.   But block it they did, and now they're shedding crocodile tears.

This is a fitting end to the 60th anniversary year of the Little Rock Nine. Now, future generations of Americans will be able to see exactly how both Little Rock Central High and the surrounding neighborhood looked to those nine brave students on that fateful day when they changed the course of history. This historic site is a precious part of our country's heritage, and it's vital that we preserve it in its entirety.","link","https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=858","cotton.senate.gov",156,84,6,9,2,1,1,12

The protests in Mashhad show that a regime driven by such a hateful ideology cannot maintain broad popular support forever, and we should support the Iranian people who are willing to risk their lives to speak out against it.","link","https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=859","cotton.senate.gov",747,270,96,55,8,15,9,89
