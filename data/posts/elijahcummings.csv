During my entire career in Congress, I have never seen any president face the levels of obstruction that President Obama faced from congressional Republicans.  They have stymied, blocked, and tried to torpedo nearly everything he has tried to do.  Despite these roadblocks, the President kept his focus on who he was fighting for—not who he was fighting against.   In the darkest days of the Great Recession, our nation’s economy was in freefall.  As a result of failed Republican economic policies, financial institutions were going bankrupt one after another, we were losing more than 700,000 jobs per month, and unemployment reached a high of 10%.     I remember very well the hearings we had in the Oversight Committee when Alan Greenspan admitted that he made a mistake by trusting our financial institutions to do the right thing.  We heard testimony from the head of Lehman Brothers, and we heard from the credit rating agencies about the abuses in which they engaged.   President Obama turned our nation around.  He pressed for a stimulus package that halted the bleeding.  Working with a Democratic Congress, he stemmed the losses.  He signed the Dodd-Frank bill, he passed the ACA, he enacted student loan reform, and he saved the auto industry.  Since that time, the unemployment rate declined from 10% to 4.7%.  We have had 75 consecutive months of job growth.  And 20 million Americans now have the security of having health insurance.    President Obama lifted this nation from financial ruins and saved us from another Great Depression.  Millions of Americans are better off today than they were eight years ago.   As President Obama begins his life outside the White House, remaining silent may not be an option when our nation is faced with issues that will affect generations yet unborn.  If those moments arise, I urge him to continue speaking boldly.  I also urge our new leaders to heed the President’s call to action.  We must do all we can to protect our progress so future generations are not fighting the same fights tomorrow that we are today.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/us/politics/obama-farewell-address-speech.html?_r=0","nytimes.com",2753,152,993,680,2,1,133,3

This is a decision each Member must make for himself or herself.   Like many of my colleagues, I have been fighting my entire life to create a more equal society for all Americans, so I certainly understand why some of them have come to the conclusion that they cannot attend.  There are so many people who came before me who struggled so that African Americans could be full participants in our democracy.  I believe that I honor their sacrifice by asserting my democratic right to attend an inauguration.  The inauguration is bigger than President-Elect Trump.  It is a chance for the world to witness our nation’s greatest ritual:  the peaceful transfer of power.  As millions of Americans witness the event, I want them to know that there will be Members of Congress present who will be vigilant to ensure that the Trump Administration is held to the highest ethical standards.  Our democracy is the strongest in the world because our powerful executive is checked by an equally powerful legislative branch.  All Members of Congress—Republicans and Democrats serving in the House and Senate—swore to uphold the Constitution and protect the American people.  It is our responsibility to do everything in our power to make sure that our federal agencies operate the way they were intended, and in an efficient and effective manner.   In two days, President-Elect Trump will control the world’s most powerful military and largest nuclear arsenal, and he will be the steward of the world’s largest economy.  I fear that during his Administration, our political institutions will suffer a crisis of legitimacy.  Many of our federal agencies, including the CIA and the FBI, will be tested.    Unfortunately, House Republicans have made clear that they have no intention of checking the Trump Administration.  Instead, they have become contortionists in their efforts to avoid doing their jobs and have coordinated with the Trump campaign in their attacks on our nation’s top ethics officials.   Congress cannot sit by as a President fails to rectify his many conflicts of interest and refuses to acknowledge his impending violations of the Emoluments Clause. We must act as the last line of defense for our democracy, press Republicans to do their jobs, and hold President-Elect Trump accountable to the American people and the rule of law.  We must also guard the progress that was made under President Obama by turning our protest into policy, and advancing legislation that will uplift the lives of the American people.","status",NA,NA,778,378,138,48,1,12,125,90

Cummings","2017-01-20","2017-01-20 15:12:07","This morning, President Barack Obama left the White House for the last time as our Commander-In-Chief.   Like many of you, I am filled with many emotions—gratitude, respect, sadness and pride.    I am old enough to remember segregation.  When I was 10 years old, my friends and I marched in Baltimore to integrate Riverside Pool.  That experience was the first time in my life that I realized I had rights other people had to respect.  And despite the progress that our nation had made in my lifetime, I did not know if I would live to see a Black president.   All that changed the day then-Senator Obama called me to let me know he was running for President. I asked him, “President of what?” He said, “President of the United States.”  He asked me to create and lead Marylanders for Obama, and I was proud when he won the Maryland Democratic Primary 61 to 36 percent.   In the years that have passed since that phone call, not once have I regretted being an early supporter of President Obama.  The poise, grace and dignity with which he has served our nation has made me proud beyond words.  He has presided over an Administration that has held the highest ethical standards and has been scandal-free for 8 years.    President Obama entered the White House at a perilous time in our nation.  Sometimes, it’s hard to remember just how scary things were.  Due to President George W. Bush’s failed economic policies, our nation’s economy was collapsing; financial institutions were going bankrupt one after another; we were losing more than 700,000 jobs every single month; and unemployment reached a high of 10%.    Despite these seemingly insurmountable odds, President Obama turned our nation around.  Working with Democrats in Congress, he pressed for a stimulus package that halted the bleeding and helped millions of American families.  He signed the Dodd-Frank Act, which brought accountability to our nation’s financial system and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  He signed the Affordable Care Act, which has helped 20 million Americans get health insurance—many of them for the first time in their lives.  He signed legislation to help students struggling under a mountain of student loan debt, and he saved millions of jobs in our nation’s auto industry.  He has also over seen 75 consecutive months of private sector job growth, and has cut our unemployment rate in half from 10% to 4.7%.   President Obama has managed to do all this with no help from Congressional Republicans.  I served under during the Administrations of Presidents Clinton and Bush before President Obama, and in all my years in Congress, I have never seen a President face as much obstruction.  For 8 years, Republicans have placed their party over their country.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, in 2010, that he and his colleagues’ primary goal was “for President Obama to be a one-term president.”    As we prepare for life under the Trump Administration, we know that we will have to fight to protect our progress.  Congressional Republicans have already set the stage to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and there are reports that the President-Elect’s first budget to Congress will propose drastic cuts to domestic violence shelters and local police departments.   For us to truly honor our great President and his legacy, we must follow his lead.  We must remain focused on what we are fighting for, not who we are fighting against.  We must work hard every day to make America more fair and more equal.  We must work to create an economy that works for all Americans, not just those at the very top.   So today, I am asking you to join me in thanking President Barack Obama.  I thank him, the First Lady and their wonderful daughters for being role models for young people across our nation.  I thank him for bringing our economy back from crisis.  And I thank him for giving us hope and reminding us that our nation is a constant work in progress, and we are all responsible for perfecting it.","status",NA,NA,1414,131,285,347,1,1,133,2

President Trump had an opportunity to unite our nation around a consensus pick like Judge Garland.  Instead, he has nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch, whose record on the bench puts him outside the legal mainstream.  Now more than ever, our nation needs an independent Supreme Court that will defend the Constitution—not protect the interest of corporations and the powerful.  Judge Gorsuch has consistently sided with corporate interests over working families, and he has spoken publicly and often about his contempt for ‘the Left’ and ‘liberals.’  I am not confident that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would defend marginalized communities’ right to equal protection.  This gives me grave concerns.  We cannot allow this to become the new normal.  Before any vote is held on his confirmation, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to examine Judge Gorsuch’s record extremely carefully to ensure that he will defend the Constitution and working families.  The American people deserve nothing less.","link","https://thinkprogress.org/who-is-neil-gorsuch-17c49a21a17f#.39mgn3axb","thinkprogress.org",293,93,120,11,0,3,7,61
