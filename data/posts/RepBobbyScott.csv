Furthermore, by slamming the door shut to refugees fleeing unimaginable violence overrunning Syria and Iraq, the President has seriously damaged the moral credibility of the United States and only bolstered anti-American sentiment that is a key recruitment tool for terrorist organizations, such as ISIS.  On its face, the President’s executive order as it pertains to refugees is a solution in search of a problem.  In contrast to refugees entering Europe, refugees who are resettled in the United States go through a rigorous, multi-agency, multi-step vetting process that can take 18 to 24 months, during which time the refugee seeking resettlement is required to remain in a refugee camp.  The overwhelming majority of those who make it through the process are women and children, survivors of violence and torture, and those with severe medical conditions.  If the President is concerned with the current process, he should work with Congress to identify problems and make any needed improvements.  Finally, I am very proud of the thousands of Americans who swiftly took action by organizing protests against this executive order at major points of entry and that legal organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, immediately filed challenges to this order.  These efforts send a clear message that the President’s actions are contrary to American values.  The President should listen to the American people and immediately rescind this executive order.  If he fails to do so, Congress must take appropriate action to address the order’s constitutional problems and openly debate and vote on whether or not our nation should be a beacon of hope to the world.","link","http://bobbyscott.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-statement-on-president-trump-s-immigration-and-refugee-executive","bobbyscott.house.gov",518,75,165,71,1,2,18,3

Later in the day, the Congressional Budget Office released their analysis of the plan.  The CBO unfortunately confirmed what we already knew - that millions of Americans would lose access to affordable health insurance under the Republican plan. This proposal was put together without considering the fundamental principles of arithmetic. By skewing the tax credits toward higher income families, it only shifts costs onto those living paycheck to paycheck. If certain people pay less, then the rest necessarily pay more. It is a zero sum game. Further, the Republican plan is fiscally irresponsible and gives a huge tax break to the wealthiest Americans. Lastly, the proposal purports to cover those with pre-existing conditions without requiring that everyone maintains health coverage. This approach has failed in numerous states that have tried it. Instead of re-trying failed health policies that result in millions paying more for less, we should build on the progress of the Affordable Care Act and not go backward.","link","http://www.dailypress.com/health/dp-nws-bobby-scott-concerns-ahca-hampton-roads-0314-20170313-story.html","dailypress.com",77,8,12,0,0,0,11,0

The 2017-2022 Leasing Program was developed collaboratively with significant input from local leaders, businesses, the Department of Defense, environmental stakeholders, and many others. Following this collaborative process, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management determined that oil and gas exploration off the coast of Virginia was not consistent with the needs of the community or the requirements of the Department of Defense.  The President’s Executive Order also ordered the Secretary of Interior to review all areas permanently withdrawn from oil and gas leasing under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, including the Norfolk and Baltimore Canyons off the Virginia coast. These unique habitats host a vast array of marine life and offer opportunities for research, conservation, and recreation. It is critical that we protect these areas, and it remains to be seen whether the President even has the authority to withdraw protections for these areas.  As the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster demonstrated, we must exercise extreme caution in offshore drilling. I have long believed that it is simply not worth the risk to Virginia’s fishery, tourism and recreational economy, to our region’s relationship with the Department of Defense, or to the health of our coastlines and the Chesapeake Bay to drill for oil that would yield nothing more than a few days-worth of national oil and gas supply.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/politics/trump-offshore-drilling.html?_r=0","nytimes.com",32,11,49,0,0,0,14,36

As a result, the job loss reported from the Bureau of Labor Statistics during September reflects the tremendous impact of these hurricanes on Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These numbers underscore the urgency to continue to help these communities recover and for Congress to pass a robust recovery package.   Notwithstanding the effect of these hurricanes on reported employment levels, wages remain stagnant despite historic gains in the stock market and the unemployment rate being at a 16 year low.  As we look forward to October, which is National Work and Family Month, I urge my Republican colleagues to work with Democrats to raise wages, help workers better balance work and family life, guarantee universal child care, and ensure no worker faces discrimination on the job.

Their proposed plan provides tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest among us and adds $1.5 trillion to the deficit. This plan provides no real investment in workers, jobs or the economy. Eventually these irresponsible tax cuts will be paid for by cutting Medicare, Medicaid, veteran services, educational resources, and other vital services for working families.

Republicans should be joining Democrats to pass commonsense legislation that would prevent gun violence including requiring background checks and prohibiting bump stocks. The so-called “Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act” endangers public safety and makes it harder for law enforcement officers to do their jobs. While some claim that this legislation simply makes it easier for law abiding gun owners to carry their firearm across state lines, in reality it simply overrides existing state laws by forcing states to comply with  the weakest gun laws. The majority of states, plus the District of Columbia, prohibit individuals convicted of violent misdemeanors, including sexual battery, aggravated assault, strangulation, inciting violence and negligent homicide, from obtaining concealed carry permits. Overriding these laws puts families, law enforcement and communities at risk. Congress has a duty to protect the American people, not the gun lobby.","status",NA,NA,146,78,18,6,4,1,11,35

This bill, which adds $1.5 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, is deeply irresponsible. The Tax Policy Center has confirmed that the final version of the bill is even more generous to the wealthiest Americans while harming even more middle class families. More than half of middle-class families will get a tax increase, while 83% of the tax cuts go to the top 1% of Americans. We know from experience that tax cuts do not pay for themselves, and we also know that this bill will do nothing to simplify the tax code. This tax scam is another giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of hardworking families. The only opportunity the middle class will have with this tax plan are the opportunities to lose access to affordable healthcare, lose investments in education, and lose the Social Security and Medicare benefits they worked so hard for.","status",NA,NA,74,78,42,3,6,7,33,102
