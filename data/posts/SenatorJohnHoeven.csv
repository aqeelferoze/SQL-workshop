Our legislation is about protecting residents’ investments in their homes around the Jamestown Reservoir and ensuring the future of this community. We appreciate all of the county officials, the park board members and the homeowners for coming together and working with us on this legislation. We look forward to advancing this bill through Congress and giving residents the opportunity to own the land on which they live.

While that includes having our UAS missions and establishing Grand Sky Business and Aviation Park, the Northern Plains Test Site and the center of excellence at UND Aerospace, it also means having a pro-growth approach that allows these innovations to be developed.
