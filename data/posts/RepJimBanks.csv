The VA is currently only authorized to transport such remains to a national veterans cemetery.  Our veterans stood ready to answer their country’s call with their lives, and we should treat their deaths with dignity. If the VA is authorized to spend the money necessary to send a deceased veteran to a national cemetery, then it makes sense for it also to pay to send these heroes to a state-owned veterans cemetery closer to home. My legislation would also decrease the burden on distraught families of deceased veterans that may be forced to travel to a far-away internment in a national cemetery.

I also pledged to support a replacement plan centered around free market health care reforms that lower costs, empower individuals and increase competition. I hope to support a repeal and replacement plan that achieves these important goals.   I commend President Trump, Speaker Ryan and the House leadership team for their hard work and inclusive approach to this debate. While the replacement plan released last night contains positive reforms like a permanent repeal of the medical device tax and repeal of the individual mandate, I have concerns about several aspects of the bill. These include: the overall cost of the plan, the length of time it takes to repeal many Obamacare taxes, the possible creation of a new entitlement program and whether essential pro-life protections will be maintained. I will carefully study this legislation and evaluate how these concerns are addressed as this bill moves through the legislative process.","status",NA,NA,75,41,5,4,0,0,0,0

Following the President's decisive action, it is vital that the United States has a comprehensive strategy that addresses the situation in Syria. Part of this strategy should include Congress passing a new AUMF. The Constitution grants Congress the power of declaring war, and we need to take that obligation seriously. Debating and passing the AUMF legislation Senator Todd Young and I have introduced is the best way for Congress to work with the Administration and support our Armed Forces.","link","http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/republicans-to-introduce-war-authorization-for-isis-fight/article/2617383","washingtonexaminer.com",10,5,1,2,1,0,0,0

These include permanently repealing the medical device tax, eliminating the individual mandate, opening up new options for states and protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions. Today is an important step in the long process of rolling back Obamacare, enacting free market reforms and improving our country’s health care system.","status",NA,NA,187,456,53,24,2,1,22,415

Congress should use this proposal as a starting point, weigh in with appropriate changes and produce a final resolution that maintains the President's commitment to balancing the budget in less than ten years.  https://banks.house.gov/media/press-releases/banks-statement-president-trump-s-budget-proposal","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJimBanks/photos/a.1625804394381394.1073741830.1424903461138156/1677474125881087/?type=3",NA,44,47,10,4,0,0,0,39

Two years later, the Iran deal is still a bad deal for the United States. Despite the U.S. honoring our side of the deal, Iran repeatedly has violated key clauses of the agreement. Reports indicate that Iran has not fully cooperated with IAEA inspectors and German intelligence officials recently reported that Iran is seeking nuclear technology outside of the bounds set by the agreement. Today Iran is more emboldened and aggressive in Syria and throughout the Middle East. These actions and others are clear evidence that this deal was and is a sham. When the Trump Administration delivers its report on the Iran deal later this month, I encourage the administration to certify Iran as non-compliant to the agreement. Additionally, it is time for Congress to pass new sanctions on Iran. We must begin reversing the damage done by the Iran deal before it is too late.","link","http://www.nationalreview.com/article/449490/iran-nuclear-deal-noncompliance","nationalreview.com",29,23,6,0,0,2,2,12

Trump's decision to change course in Afghanistan and focus on achieving victory rather than avoiding defeat. The plot to execute 9/11 was hatched in Afghanistan, and together with Pakistan, the region is still a breeding ground for terrorism today. As the most recently deployed member of Congress, I saw firsthand the disintegration of efforts in Afghanistan under the Obama Administration’s abrupt drawdown. We must continue taking the fight there to prevent this terrorism from returning to our shores. This is only possible with a sound strategy, a steadfast commitment to building the capacity of our Afghan partners and enough troops to finish the mission. I’m pleased we finally have a commander-in-chief who is ready to provide the right leadership to win the war in Afghanistan. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the House Armed Services Committee in the days and weeks ahead to monitor the implementation of the President's proposed strategy.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJimBanks/photos/a.1669193693375797.1073741832.1424903461138156/1711178275844005/?type=3",NA,197,60,16,12,1,2,4,14

Yesterday I voted for a bill that would provide $8 billion in immediate relief to address the damage done by Hurricane Harvey. This legislation passed the House, but after a meeting at the White House, President Trump, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer agreed on a deal to attach a debt ceiling increase and government funding to this Harvey relief bill. The Senate will add these items, pass the bill, and send it back to the House.     This agreement is disappointing for two reasons. First, disaster relief funding should be about disaster relief, and nothing more. Attaching other issues to this bill plays politics with an issue that should rise above it. Secondly, with our country $20 trillion in debt, simply maintaining the status quo and allowing more debt to accumulate on the national credit card is unacceptable.

Our Founding Fathers saw the danger in centralizing power in one branch of government, and they designed a system that empowers our states to be laboratories of democracy. Unfortunately, we’ve moved away from that model and today Washington has too much power over the lives of every American citizen. We need to return power back to the states and promote federalism.

A graduate of the Indiana University School of Medicine, Colonel Frantz served with the Flying Tigers during World War II and was an air attaché in Saigon during the early stages of the Vietnam War. He then retired from the Air Force in 1967 and continued his public service by becoming director of the A.P. Beutel Health Center at Texas A&M, where he mentored thousands of doctors. Colonel Frantz passed away in 1982. Congressman Shimkus received this heirloom violin from his parents, and his own children then used it for recitals and concerts.

I also plan to support legislation currently being drafted by Rep. Ron DeSantis (FL-06) that would prohibit members from using taxpayer dollars to settle sexual harassment claims and require transparency regarding how much taxpayers have paid out to victims.    Members of Congress should not be above the law, and American taxpayers should not pay for the misbehavior of our elected officials. Over the last 20 years, settlements have cost taxpayers $17 million – a number that should undoubtedly be zero. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and it is time for more congressional accountability and transparency to end this misconduct.    Capitol Hill should be a safe workplace for all, and as the people’s representatives, we should lead by example. I have completed the sexual harassment training provided by the House and asked my entire staff to do the same.

The most egregious of these efforts came in 2014 when the EPA, under President Obama, proposed the WOTUS rule. This rule set out the agency’s interpretation of which bodies of waters are “navigable” and therefore subject to federal regulation.  Unelected bureaucrats making laws is a direct threat to our system of government, and I support the steps taken earlier this year by the Trump administration to rescind the WOTUS rule. I discussed the negative effects of the WOTUS rule on Hoosier farmers during a recent Science Committee hearing.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepJimBanks/videos/1747707608857738/",NA,109,77,12,10,1,0,0,29

Putting aside the fact that this is not the government’s money in the first place, I believe this is the wrong way to look at the “cost” of any tax legislation. A recent post by the Tax Foundation illustrates this. It points out that the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the tax bills passed by the House and Senate will reduce government revenues by $1 trillion over a decade (for context, this means that instead of collecting $46 trillion in revenues over the next decade, the government will collect $45 trillion). The same analysis finds that the bills will increase economic growth by $1.67-$1.9 trillion over the same period (depending on whether you are looking at the House or the Senate bill). It is clear from these numbers that the economic growth generated from these tax cuts far outweighs their “cost” and will lead to more jobs and higher wages for middle-class Hoosier families.","link","https://taxfoundation.org/jcts-analysis-shows-tax-plans-pay-higher-gdp/?utm_source=Tax+Foundation+Newsletters&utm_campaign=fc88f17b21-RSS_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_8387957ec9-fc88f17b21-428942593&mc_cid=fc88f17b21&mc_eid=024e20ae43","taxfoundation.org",73,66,7,6,4,1,1,25

We have all prayed for the families of troops killed in training accidents this year, and their tragic deaths are just one piece of evidence that our military is struggling. In an increasingly dangerous world, with a range of growing threats from North Korea to ISIS, the fact that the Army has only five of 58 brigade combat teams ready to fight right now is both shocking and unacceptable. The cause of this readiness crisis is clear. In the face of mounting threats and increasing operations, military budgets have been cut nearly 20 percent over the past six years. I write in today’s @JGfortwayne about how this crisis is serious, yet avoidable. On Capitol Hill, there’s a bipartisan consensus that this issue must be addressed and it’s time to act.","link","http://www.journalgazette.net/opinion/columns/20171222/plottingmilitarysrestorationto-readiness","journalgazette.net",53,28,3,2,2,0,3,6

Unfortunately, due to comments by Jimmy Kimmel and others, the facts surrounding CHIP have become distorted.    Funding for CHIP technically expired on October 1, but states - including Indiana - have been operating the program with excess funds provided by the Department of Health and Human Services. On November 3, I voted for a bill to reauthorize CHIP for five years, a bill that passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 242-174. Most Republicans voted for this legislation with some support from Democrats. Unfortunately, the Senate never considered this bill.   This week I voted for a bill that fully funds CHIP for six months, backdated to October 1. Again, most Republicans voted for this bill and most Democrats voted against it. This time, the legislation passed both the House and Senate, and CHIP is now funded through the end of March 2018.   Despite the false claims of some, Republicans are not trying to take away health care coverage from children or hurt kids. In the coming weeks, I will continue working with my colleagues on a long-term, fiscally responsible re-authorization of CHIP. I hope many Democrats will join this effort and quit holding this issue hostage for political gain.","status",NA,NA,165,79,66,12,1,2,1,16
