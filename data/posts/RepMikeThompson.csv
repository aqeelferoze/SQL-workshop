He won’t guarantee funding. He’s weakened the foundations of the program. He stopped outreach and promotion of the last enrollment period.  He pushed through a repeal bill that guts coverage and could create a death spiral for the individual insurance market.    Millions of Americans—including nearly 2 million in California alone—rely on the individual market for their healthcare. The President shouldn’t jeopardize their coverage.

This is POLICY. Every Member of Congress is elected to work and vote on policy, and gun violence is no different.   For those who say this isn’t the time to raise this issues, I ask; when is the time? After the next mass shooting? Or on any one day of the year when 30 people are killed by someone using a gun? That’s the number: 30 people every day killed by someone using a gun.   If you are one who believes there should be no gun laws or one who believes there should be no guns, stop reading now because we will, most likely, never agree.            To clarify specific criticism regarding my work on gun violence prevention:   1. “He’s out to destroy the second amendment.”   I support the Second Amendment and have not proposed nor suggested any bills that are in conflict with the Second Amendment. My legislation would expand background checks to cover all commercial sales of firearms. This is constitutional and supported overwhelmingly by the American people, gun owners included. I’m also co-leading legislation to prohibit “bump stocks,” a device to make semi-automatic guns function similar to fully automatic weapons.   2.  “He owns more guns than the average person, he’s a hypocrite.”   That is half true. I do own guns and given that only a third of Americans own a gun or guns, I do own more than the average person. But, more important, don’t you want someone who knows something about guns working on these issues? As a matter of fact, I often hear or read someone complaining about people passing gun laws who don’t know anything about guns. Or “he or she doesn’t even know the difference between a magazine and a clip.” You can’t have it both ways.    3. “He took a $4k contribution from the NRA.”   True enough. However, the NRA has never endorsed me, annually gives me a D- or F grade, and I haven’t received a contribution from them in well over a decade. And since then, I’ve donated that $4k and more to gun buyback programs in our district.    4. “He wants to take my guns.”   This is only true if you are a criminal, a terrorist, or dangerously mentally ill. I believe in and support the Second Amendment. I also believe and will work tirelessly to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists, and the dangerously mentally ill.     5. “He’s not working with the Republicans on this issue.”   Not so. I am working with a number of Republicans on my bipartisan bill to expand background checks for anyone buying a gun from a commercial entity. Congressman Peter King, a Republican, is my coauthor. Sadly, the Republican leadership has, for four and a half years, refused to hold hearings or take a vote on this bill. For two years, the Republican leadership has ignored our request to form a Select Committee of Democrats and Republicans to work to find solutions to help prevent gun violence. I’ll work with anyone to keep our community safe.   I became chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force after the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School where 20 first graders were murdered along with six teachers. I’ve worked on this every day since. I’ve worked on this issue the day after the Las Vegas mass shooting and the day before. I’ve talked about it in every town hall meeting and at official and non-official events in our district. Most recently, during a lunch speech at the St Helena Rotary two weeks ago.    Most unfortunately, nearly every day is “the day after a mass shooting.” Las Vegas was the 273 mass shooting in 2017.   So the only ones politicizing this issue are those who sit by and criticize. If you have ideas that will make our communities safe and not conflict with our constitutional rights, let’s hear them. If you just want to criticize or spread misinformation, you are part of the problem.","status",NA,NA,909,214,159,156,0,0,3,7

La calidad del aire puede mejorar o a veces empeorar, rápidamente. • Para disminuir su exposición al humo de los incendios, se recomienda limitar su tiempo afuera y permanecer en el interior tanto como sea posible. • Si es posible, busque albergue en edificios con aire filtrado O muevase a áreas fuera de la región que son menos afectadas por el humo de incendios hasta que los niveles de humo disminuyan. • Mantenga sus ventanas y puertas cerradas a menos que este extremadamente caliente afuera. Si usted no tiene un acondicionador de aire, permanecer dentro con las ventanas cerradas puede ser peligroso en un clima extremadamente caliente. En este caso, busque albergue alternativo. • Use su acondicionador de aire dentro de su hogar o en el coche en reciclar o recircular. Mantenga la válvula del aire fresco cerrada y el filtro limpio para evitar de traer dentro humo adicional. • Los niños, los ancianos y aquellos con afecciones respiratorias como el asma, la Enfermedad Pulmunar Obstructiva Cronica, el enfisema y las enfermedades del corazón son los más afectados. • Si tiene niños, asma u otra enfermedad pulmonar, asegúrese de seguir las instrucciones de su médico acerca de como tomar sus medicamentos y siga su plan de manejo del asma. Llame a su médico si sus síntomas empeoran o cuando y si debe de irse del área. • Pedimos a los residentes que eviten agregar más contaminación al aire limitando las actividades contaminantes del aire, como la quema de leña, el cortar el césped y el soplado de hojas, la conducción y el asar comida. • No confíe en las máscaras contra el polvo para su protección.

Benefits will be made available to eligible people who either lived or worked in Butte, Lake, Mendocino, Napa, Nevada, Sonoma and Yuba Counties at the time the wildfires began on October 8, 2017; have been affected by the disaster; and meet certain D-SNAP eligibility criteria.  Approved households will receive one month of benefits, equivalent to the maximum amount of benefits normally issued to a SNAP household of their size to meet their food needs as they return to their communities to recover and rebuild.  Current SNAP participants in the affected areas will also receive additional benefits as appropriate to match the D-SNAP amounts.

While the prevalence of gun violence in our country is much more complicated than that, the President has done nothing to bolster mental health treatment, quite the opposite—he’s undermined mental health services at every turn. He is working to repeal the Affordable Care Act which covers mental health treatment, he has called for drastic cuts to mental health services in his budget, and he’s signed legislation that prevents the Social Security Administration from reporting information about mentally incompetent beneficiaries into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). It’s disgraceful that he would use this argument to dodge a substantive, national conversation about what we can do to help prevent gun violence in our neighborhoods.   If the President is serious about keeping guns out of the hands of the dangerously mentally ill, I urge him to call on House Republicans to take up the bipartisan bill I introduced last week to do just that. The Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2017 that I introduced with Republican Congressman Peter King, would expand background checks to help stop criminals, domestic abusers, and the dangerously mentally ill from purchasing a gun. Background checks work. Every day, more than 170 felons, some 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives are stopped from purchasing a gun. This legislation would strengthen that system and keep guns out of the wrong hands.   House Republicans can also bring to the floor, the Safer Communities Act, legislation I have introduced that would strengthen and improve mental health intervention efforts, close gaps in current federal law allowing dangerously mentally ill individuals to possess firearms, and allow the CDC to conduct gun violence research.   While we mourn the loss of the Texans brutally gunned down in their house of worship—many of whom were children—we cannot wait another day to do something to help stop future tragedies like this.","status",NA,NA,227,36,58,3,0,1,28,17

They held no hearings. They heard from no expert witnesses. And they unveiled the final bill just one week ago. For something as big as rewriting America’s tax code, this process is wildly irresponsible.   What’s worse than the process is the product. This bill actually raises taxes on many middle class families and adds $2.3 trillion to our already too high national debt, all to give massive tax breaks to the wealthy and corporate interests. Our tax code is a zero-sum game, and these tax breaks come at the expense of the middle class and future generations.   Let’s be clear about what’s going on here. Republicans in Washington are desperate for a win and so are their donors. That is why they’ve jammed through a tax bill in which 70 percent of the tax breaks go to corporate interests.   This is not how a country should be governed. Republicans ought to listen to their constituents—not just their donors—and work across the aisle to deliver meaningful and sustainable tax reform.   I’ll continue to do everything I can to fight this backwards bill as it continues through the legislative process.","status",NA,NA,556,135,147,15,0,6,55,138

We heard from Mark Zandi, John McCain’s presidential campaign economic advisor, about his analysis of the Republicans’ tax bill. Here’s are the highlights from this prominent Republican economist’s testimony about the bill:   1. Does not sustainably increase economic growth in any meaningful way. 2. Adds significantly to the nation’s debt load and our deficit. 3. Low-income and middle-income households will not benefit in a sustained way from this legislation. Higher income, very wealthy households do benefit in a very significant way. 4. The unintended consequences of this bill will be quite significant. There will be many mistakes in this legislation that will be very difficult to fix... and it’s going to make life more difficult for small businesses. 5. Couldn’t be worse timing… the Federal Reserve will have to respond to this legislation by raising interest rates. Whatever benefit businesses and the economy get from lower rates will be completely washed out by the higher interest rates.   Any way you slice it, this is a terrible bill. Republicans need to drop it and work across the aisle to deliver real tax reform to the American people.","status",NA,NA,123,44,107,2,1,4,25,60
