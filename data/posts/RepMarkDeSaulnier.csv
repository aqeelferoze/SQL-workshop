Behind closed doors and before the new session of Congress even began Republicans attempted to eliminate the only independent ethics panel for Members of Congress. Before engaging in further actions that will undermine the American people's expectation that their government will be open and transparent, Republicans should be mindful of the outrage they received from this sneaky and secretive act.","link","http://bit.ly/2iLMvmn","bit.ly",153,45,29,1,2,4,7,47

Her lack of experience with public schools either as a student, parent of a student, educator, or professional working on education policy leaves her ill-equipped to appreciate the true value public education provides our students.

Such actions have widened the rift between Americans on both sides of the political spectrum, rather than unifying as one American body. We cannot afford to be a divided country.   It is my hope that the President takes note of these polarized responses, and recognizes that this is no way to govern our country. No one person in America is the same, we all come from different backgrounds, have varying points of view and values – which is our greatest asset. It is our duty as Americans to embrace these differences and live out our country’s motto: “E pluribus unum:” out of many one. Finding solutions to the most pressing problems facing our nation depends upon finding a common ground.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepMarkDeSaulnier/videos/629471553930611/",NA,343,63,36,19,2,4,9,3

This short-sighted action disregards the consensus among scientists that carbon pollution directly impacts the Earth’s climate. As a former member of the California Air Resources Board, I have witnessed first-hand the impacts of global warming in our community on both human health and the environment. In California, our Renewable Portfolio Standard has not only improved public health, the environment, and helped grow our economy to the sixth largest in the world, but it has reduced our reliance on foreign oil. It has been clear since the campaign that President Trump valued investments in big oil, and today’s action underscores that he values growing the fossil industry over the health of the American people. We should be investing in cleaner air, water, and renewable energy not ignoring scientific facts.

Over the past six years, nearly ten million Syrian civilians have been displaced and driven from their homes, and almost four hundred thousand Syrians have lost their lives. The latest use of chemical weapons on its citizens by the Assad regime demands action by the international community.  The ability of the United States Administration to respond to these attacks is hindered by the relationship between President Trump and the Russian government, which has compromised our moral authority. These rash airstrikes alone are not sufficient to combat the war crimes perpetrated by the Assad regime. President Trump must provide a clear and rational strategy that will not only aid Syrian citizens, but also keep safe the men and women serving in the United States Armed Forces. This strategy must include consulting with Congress and seeking an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), as required by the Constitution.  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/07/us-russia-relations-syria-military-strikes-putin-trump","link","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/07/us-russia-relations-syria-military-strikes-putin-trump","theguardian.com",101,33,12,5,0,2,5,3

History has revealed time and time again that cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society does not foster economic boom, but rather creates lackluster growth and in some cases financial crisis. According to the nonpartisan, independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, this fiscally irresponsible plan could increase the federal debt to 111% of GDP by 2027, a new historical record.

No mother or father should see their child’s life cut short by an accident that could have been prevented with commonsense safety improvements. Fatalities from motor vehicle accidents in California increased 13 percent from 2015 to 2016. Today I joined Congressman Steve Cohen, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and Senator Marco Rubio to introduce bipartisan, bicameral legislation to help make our roads safer. Today’s bill introduction would not be possible without the perseverance of Marianne Karth and Lois Durso, two loving and dedicated mothers who each lost children in truck underride collisions.
