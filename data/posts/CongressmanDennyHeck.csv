This nonpartisan office was created in March 2008 after it was discovered that Members of Congress and their staff were illegally accepting gifts and donations from lobbyists. It has become an important institution of accountability for Congress. I believe we earn the people’s trust by ensuring that every member of this body respects the duties of the office and exercises their responsibilities with the highest set of standards.   I'm relieved to share that by midday today, those who proposed the rule change realized that limiting oversight of Members of Congress is not what the American people want, and did the right thing by taking that provision out of the proposed package.

A lot has changed since I entered Congress, especially when it comes to our national security. Our military has continued to re-position itself in the Asia-Pacific region. As more people get online, cybersecurity is increasingly in the headlines. And after this election, our defenses against hacking by foreign actors has come into question.

Whether I’m looking at market-rate housing trends or ways to combat youth homelessness, there is always progress that can be made. Homes are a place to raise a family, a tool to build equity, and a part of a neighborhood or community that count on homeowners to thrive. But last weekend the Trump administration went backwards, and suspended the Federal Home Administration mortgage insurance rate cut within an hour of taking office. This cut saves first-time homeowners an average of $500 a year. Maybe $500 isn’t a lot of savings to a man of extreme wealth, but to our sons and daughters, nieces and nephews, and young families around the country, that matters as they try to afford homes in this increasingly expensive home market. As your representative, I’m interested only in policies and initiatives that help your family stay financially healthy and happy in a home of your own. Let’s focus on ways to build a successful economy for everyone.   I recently gave remarks on our national housing policy at a Zillow Economic Forum in DC.

Let’s expand entrepreneurship and innovation, close the skills gap, invest in our infrastructure, support American manufacturing, and grow our economy.

This young man and his father were from Syria. This 10 year old had survived a terrible war, and now was learning English at a breakneck pace and playing soccer every chance he could get. On that day his smile was a mile wide and he was excited to have a front row seat to democracy in action.   President Donald Trump's discriminatory and unconstitutional executive order denies our country the potential of people like Ahmad and his family.

If passed, the Statue of Liberty Values Act (SOLVe Act) would prevent the executive order from having any force of law and prohibit any federal funds or fees from being used to carry it out. The Freedom of Religion Act states that the United States could not bar foreigners from coming to the United States on the basis of their religious beliefs. The No Religious Registration Act would stop the government from creating or using a database of religious affiliation for the purpose of surveillance or of classifying U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and visa seekers.  These bills reflect long-standing American values laid down in the First Amendment. What President Trump’s Administration is attempting to do is un-American and cruel, and I know both Republicans and Democrats do not agree with this blatant violation of the right to the free exercise of religion.  Furthermore, our men and women in uniform rely on many Muslim allies in the ongoing fight against terror around the world. To turn our backs on programs and policies that encourage collaboration with our Muslim friends and partners, and to discriminate based on their religion and place of birth, would render us less safe.

They do amazing work to address the financial issues that impact servicemembers, veterans, and their families, and work with Members of Congress like me to help make common sense changes that work for both military families and the financial industry. Members of the military often have unique challenges with their finances due to their time away from home, and specific protections are in place to make sure they aren't responsible for owing interest on loans when they are busy on active duty, often in far-away places. I've worked with the financial industry to ensure that everyone knows of these protections and can implement them without confusion or error.

Her intellectual prowess was unmatched, and combined with a hardnosed work ethic she became a formidable force for higher education, fiscal responsibility, and women’s rights. She will be forever remembered, respected, and admired for what she was able to accomplish, as well as her incredible grasp on some of the most-pressing legislative issues of our time. I will miss our arguments and her amazing hugs. She was a great legislator and an even better person.   Today we wear red in honor of International Women's Day and A Day Without A Woman, and remember one amazing Washingtonian who we lost recently.

Today West Point's graduates serve our country and go on to a number of different fields critical to our country's national security, economy, government, and more.

But if you make $40,000 a year, 4 cents extra per dollar in earnings is $1,600 more dollars a year. That's a lot of money for the average South Sound family, and that is why I'm glad that women's average wages for the 10th Congressional District have gone from 82 cents per dollar that men make to now 86 cents.  But that still isn't equal. And that is why I still strongly support the Paycheck Fairness Act. The balancing of the scales doesn’t mean that women gain and men lose. More pay means more disposable income injected right back into our stores, services, and housing market. Equitable pay for women helps all families reap the rewards of a prosperous economy booming from higher paychecks.  I invite you to read the opinion piece I wrote with local leaders from the AAUW Washington in 2015. While the pay gap has closed somewhat, our message remains the same. A rising tide lifts all boats. Let's continue to make progress for our working families.","link","http://www.theolympian.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/article26120824.html#storylink=cpy","theolympian.com",147,4,7,12,0,0,0,0

Our salmon are dying due to higher water temperatures.   Our shellfish farmers are struggling to adapt to ocean acidification.   Our increasingly dry, hot summers are causing massive forest fires.   While all of us in Washington state work hard to combat these threats, we need strong leadership from the federal government if we are to be successful.   Climate change is not only settled fact, it is a complex problem that requires global coordination and cooperation to combat.   That’s why action to address climate change is broadly supported by the American people and U.S. companies—even ExxonMobil and others in the oil and gas industry.

An easy one: our kids should have the chance to grow up healthy! That’s why at the very minimum, we need to protect the Clean Power Plan, and reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).   Introduced in 2015, the EPA’s Clean Power Plan is the first and only federal limit on carbon pollution from existing power plants. It’s projected to prevent 90,000 asthma attacks, 300,000 missed work and school days, and 3,600 premature deaths annually by 2030. By EPA's own estimate, every dollar of investment in the Clean Power Plan saves seven dollars in health care costs. That was a lot of numbers to throw at you, but the bottom line is this: we should not get rid of this vital goal that is both morally and fiscally responsible.   The CHIP program provides health care coverage for tens of thousands of kids in Washington through the Apple Health program, and millions of kids across the country. It is a necessary safety net so that our kids can focus on school and grow into healthy, successful members of our community. This program has always enjoyed bipartisan support, because all parties can agree that good health is an important part of every child's development. But since September 30 of this year, federal funding for CHIP has been in limbo, and Congressional leadership has refused to act.  If we want kids to do their homework, we've got to do ours. I strongly support the continuation of these common sense programs and will urge my colleagues, as well as the Administration, to move quickly to make sure these protections and programs remain in place.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanDennyHeck/photos/a.553750367969335.137570.547907568553615/1686538424690518/?type=3",NA,300,61,24,17,1,0,0,6

For those of you who don't know, CHIP is the program that allows Apple Health for Kids extend quality health care coverage to over 50,000 kids across our state.   Despite the overwhelming support CHIP enjoys on both sides of the aisle, Congress allowed CHIP's funding to lapse on October 1st. Without congressional action, tens of thousands of young Washingtonians stand to lose coverage in 2018. I'm working to make sure this does not happen. This week, I cosponsored the CHAMPION KIDS Act (H.R. 4541), which, among other things, would reauthorize CHIP for five years.   We cannot have a healthy future without healthy kids. So let's get working on that to-do list and pass the CHAMPION KIDS Act!","status",NA,NA,208,39,18,19,0,1,5,4

It also improves the system in order to better protect victims of sexual harassment, and requires an anonymous ""climate survey"" of Congressional employees every two years.
