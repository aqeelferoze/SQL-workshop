But that’s exactly the approach Speaker Ryan advocated for this morning, when he said that the President should not work with Democrats to improve health care for the American people. It is even more concerning that he has since chosen to double down on his remarks. Democrats are ready to work in good faith to achieve the kind of bipartisan improvements to the Affordable Care Act that can strengthen the law and help more people get covered while bringing costs down. Playing partisan games with Americans' access to affordable health care, as Speaker Ryan wants to do, will not achieve either goal. http://bit.ly/2mT5HnX","link","http://bit.ly/2mT5HnX","bit.ly",104,21,14,2,1,2,0,15

That is exactly what we have seen happen with the House Intelligence Committee as a result of the actions of its chairman, which have cast a cloud of doubt and partisanship over its proceedings. The news that White House aides furnished the reports that Chairman Congressman Devin Nunes cited in defense of the President's wiretapping claims further disqualifies him as being able to lead a serious and unbiased investigation. I continue to believe that the best way to get answers for the American people is through a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate not only Russian efforts to influence our election last year but also ongoing attempts to subvert our democracy.

I will continue to stand up in Congress for the people of Puerto Rico, who are American citizens, to ensure that they can choose the status they believe is best for them and their future, and I urge the Justice Department to release funds to the Puerto Rican government as promised in 2014. http://bit.ly/2ofgOYF","link","http://bit.ly/2ofgOYF","bit.ly",119,9,22,1,0,4,0,10

As the process of seeking relief under the Promesa framework moves forward, it is critical that the nearly $50 billion in unfunded pensions obligations of hard-working Puerto Ricans are protected.  Debt relief cannot come on the backs of those who have worked hard and taken responsibility throughout their lives.  I will continue to work with Reps. Nydia Velazquez, Jose Serrano, Luis Gutierrez, and others in Congress who are deeply engaged on issues relating to Puerto Rico to ensure that its people, who are American citizens, can build a stronger future for themselves and their children without having to leave the island to seek opportunity elsewhere. http://bit.ly/2qzczFb","link","http://bit.ly/2qzczFb","bit.ly",20,2,1,1,0,1,0,0

While the number of jobs added last month is positive, we cannot overlook the importance of this point. Too many workers were already finding it difficult to stretch their paycheck to make ends meet, which makes this decline even more troubling. That’s why the House Republican tax bill is a bad deal for middle class families. Millions of Americans will see their taxes go up so that Republicans can give massive tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. It eliminates tax deductions that many middle class Americans rely on, including the state and local tax deduction and the student loan interest deduction. It also explodes the deficit by $1.5 trillion, setting up future cuts to critical programs like Medicare. http://bit.ly/2AhUvE2","link","http://bit.ly/2AhUvE2","bit.ly",71,41,43,0,0,2,27,25

Every American ought to be outraged that a senior White House official committed a felony while in office – particularly when that individual is the most senior official in charge of ensuring our national security, and that the crime to which he pled guilty relates to conversations with a foreign adversary.  Given specifics of Mr. Flynn’s crime, Americans should be particularly concerned about whether the Russian government exerted undue influence over our electoral process and over high officials of our government.  The President’s recent attempts to convince Republicans in Congress to undermine the special prosecutor’s investigation into this matter further raises speculation about who else might be involved and what the President is trying to hide.

Contrary to their claims that it would benefit the middle-class, this bill would raise taxes on 82 million middle-class households and kick 13 million Americans off their health care coverage.  After railing against deficits for years, they voted to burden our children and grandchildren with an additional $1.7 trillion in debt.  Despite their protestations to the contrary, this bill would unambiguously trigger a $25 billion automatic cut to Medicare next month.  Moreover, it falls short of their lofty projections for expanding economic growth, and so will not produce the promised revenues sufficient to offset its massive unpaid-for tax cuts for the wealthiest few.  Under this bill, those making over $900,000 a year receive 62% of all the benefits, directly contradicting Republican leaders’ claims that they are motivated by a desire to help those struggling to get by and living paycheck to paycheck.   This bill is deeply unpopular for a reason.  The ramifications of this bill, were it to become law, are clear: higher taxes for middle-class individuals and families, $1.7 trillion in additional debt for our children and grandchildren, all while giving the bulk of tax cuts to those already at the top.

I hope the Senate will take up and pass this bill without delay.","status",NA,NA,64,20,4,3,0,1,0,2

She asked a question about a topic I feel strongly about: the #GOPTaxScam. Her full question: “I am asking the Democrats not to help Republicans fix their tax bill where they made a mistake and it does not give corporations all of the cuts they wanted to give them. Republicans did not help Democrats fix the ACA and blocked a Supreme Court judge to name a couple of their obstructions to Obama's administration. Please call the leadership and make this request. Thank you. Pass this information along if possible.”  2. Nancy, thank you for taking the time to ask a question. As you know, I am opposed to the #GOPTaxScam, which would increase taxes on 78 million middle-class households, give the wealthiest 1% of taxpayers over 60% of the benefits, and kick 13 million Americans off their health care coverage. The bill would also trigger a $25 billion cut to Medicare next year alone and explode the national debt by $1.7 trillion. The specific mistake you reference in your question is the result of Republicans rushing the bill to the Floor without any hearings, witnesses, or sufficient time for Senators to read the bill and understand what’s in it. Only now, as tax experts review the final legislation passed by the Senate, are we learning about the implications of the bill.  I will continue to strongly oppose the legislation and Democrats will continue to call on Republicans to abandon this bill and work with Democrats on a bill to reform our tax code in a way that helps middle-class families and doesn’t explode the deficit. #Hoyer5at5","status",NA,NA,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0

Puerto Ricans, who are #OueFellowAmericans, continue to face serious, life-threatening hardship after the storm as a result of inadequate access to medical care and from poor conditions in areas still without power or clean water.  Many of these victims have been the elderly, and in some areas critical health care infrastructure – such as dialysis machines and ventilators – is still absent.   This updated figure comes two months after President Donald J. Trump insensitively claimed that Puerto Ricans ought to be ‘very proud’ that the death toll wasn’t higher and after he said the storm was not ‘a real catastrophe.’  He ought to apologize to the families of those who lost their lives as a result of Hurricane Maria and take all the steps necessary to ensure that federal aid is getting to the places that need it, both in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Congress should also take action in the coming weeks on disaster relief.

It attributed much of its assumed economic expansion to a vague list of initiatives beyond taxes, many of which this Administration has yet to propose. Baselessly asserting that the economy will grow faster simply because one says so is both disingenuous and dangerously misleading. Instead of pursuing this tax scam, Republicans ought to be working on a plan to prevent a dangerous and costly government shutdown.  http://bit.ly/2BUn6Qb","link","http://bit.ly/2BUn6Qb","bit.ly",30,12,20,2,0,3,3,24

On that day, a lone gunman in Newtown, Connecticut, killed twenty-six innocent people, twenty of them young children and six brave educators protecting their students.  In the five years since, while Congress has failed to take any meaningful action to prevent gun violence, more than 170,000 Americans have been killed.  More than 1,700 mass shootings have occurred in that same period, most recently in Las Vegas and Southerland Springs, yet Congress’s only response has been to hold moments of silence.  Silence, however, will not bring back those who have been lost or bring comfort to shattered families.  Silence will not keep dangerous weapons of war out of the hands of terror suspects, violent domestic abusers, or the seriously mentally ill.  Silence cannot fill the vacuum of action that this Republican-led Congress has created, offering only measures endorsed by the gun lobby that make our communities less safe from gun violence.   As we mourn this anniversary of the senseless killing of innocent children and those who cared for them, let us strive toward achieving the kind of commonsense gun safety legislation that Americans – including responsible gun owners – overwhelmingly support.

Trump today highlights the disconnect between this Administration’s rhetoric and the reality of his presidency.  While the President talks about making America safer, he consistently undermines that effort – whether by refusing to acknowledge Russia’s interference in our election and the national security danger it poses; recklessly threatening war with North Korea; cozying up to China’s autocratic regime; wavering on our collective defense commitment through NATO; insulting key allies; or hollowing out the State Department.  Under President Trump, our nation’s image has been eroded around the globe, and a less respected America is a weaker America.  If this President is in any way serious about national security, he should start by embracing the basic tenets of American leadership: uniting rather than dividing, and defending our democratic ideals abroad and at home.","status",NA,NA,153,29,40,3,5,1,14,22
