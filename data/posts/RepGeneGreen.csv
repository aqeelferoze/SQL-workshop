Although I’m pleased that CHIP was extended for five years, it’s frustrating that there’s a lack of bipartisan support for programs that have been successfully authorized for 20 and 50 years, respectively.  To pay for CHIP and the Community Health Centers, the House Republican Majority included language that will charge Medicare beneficiaries more, cut Medicaid, and cut the Prevention and Public health fund, a fund that goes toward immunizations, prevention of diabetes, lead testing, and much more.  Children’s health insurance and the access to care that community health centers provide is vital, but paying for it by taking care away from other groups is unacceptable.

It’s alarming that the plan will eliminate the deduction for personal casualty losses, which will be a big blow for many hurricane Harvey victims whose homes were damaged after one of the largest disasters in Texas’ history. It’s even more alarming that taxes for the smallest earners will increase from 10 percent to 12 percent while the tax brackets for high earners stay the same. And for those who graduated college and are paying off their student loans debt, the tax plan will eliminate the student loan interest deduction.   It’s estimated that the GOP plan will save the bottom 80 percent of earners between $50 and $450 in taxes per year, but that it saves each person in the top 1 percent of earners an average of $129,000 a year. Overall, I am not confident my constituents will be better off with this plan.
