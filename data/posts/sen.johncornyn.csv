Doris “Dorie” Miller failed eighth grade twice and was deemed unsuitable for a Depression-era government assistance job by the age of 19. This didn’t stop him from fighting his way into a job on the USS West Virginia. During the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, he heard a roar as Japanese bombs hit his ship. He had no experience with anti-aircraft weapons, but Dorie didn’t hesitate when he spotted an unmanned machine gun station and took aim at the incoming Japanese bombers.   Men who served alongside him that day recall Dorie shooting down as many as six Japanese bombers, although the true number has never been known. Sadly, Dorie’s heroic service in defense of his country came to an end two years later when a Japanese torpedo dealt a fatal blow to the USS Liscome Bay.

She was born in Atlanta, Texas in 1892. At a time when very few women or African-Americans could be pilots, she was determined. After being denied from every flight school she approached, Bessie learned French, saved her money, and moved to Paris to pursue her dream of flight. After receiving an international pilot’s license, she returned to the United States to perform aerial stunts as the first female African-American pilot.    Bessie used this new position of influence to encourage women to pursue careers in aviation, and as a platform to fight for equality—refusing to perform anywhere that would not admit African-Americans. Bessie’s career inspired countless women after her to take to the skies, and her commitment to equality continues to inspire us today.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenJohnCornyn/photos/a.112318184423.92543.75755694423/10154996181289424/?type=3",NA,394,78,105,41,0,7,0,0

An excerpt from the Unanimous Declaration of Independence made by the Delegates of the People of Texas in General Convention at the Town of Washington:   When a government has ceased to protect the lives, liberty and property of the people, from whom its legitimate powers are derived, and for the advancement of whose happiness it was instituted, and so far from being a guarantee for the enjoyment of those inestimable and inalienable rights, becomes an instrument in the hands of evil rulers for their oppression.   When the Federal Republican Constitution of their country, which they have sworn to support, no longer has a substantial existence, and the whole nature of their government has been forcibly changed, without their consent, from a restricted federative republic, composed of sovereign states, to a consolidated central military despotism, in which every interest is disregarded but that of the army and the priesthood, both the eternal enemies of civil liberty, the everready minions of power, and the usual instruments of tyrants.   When, long after the spirit of the constitution has departed, moderation is at length so far lost by those in power, that even the semblance of freedom is removed, and the forms themselves of the constitution discontinued, and so far from their petitions and remonstrances being regarded, the agents who bear them are thrown into dungeons, and mercenary armies sent forth to force a new government upon them at the point of the bayonet.   When, in consequence of such acts of malfeasance and abdication on the part of the government, anarchy prevails, and civil society is dissolved into its original elements. In such a crisis, the first law of nature, the right of self-preservation, the inherent and inalienable rights of the people to appeal to first principles, and take their political affairs into their own hands in extreme cases, enjoins it as a right towards themselves, and a sacred obligation to their posterity, to abolish such government, and create another in its stead, calculated to rescue them from impending dangers, and to secure their future welfare and happiness.   Nations, as well as individuals, are amenable for their acts to the public opinion of mankind. A statement of a part of our grievances is therefore submitted to an impartial world, in justification of the hazardous but unavoidable step now taken, of severing our political connection with the Mexican people, and assuming an independent attitude among the nations of the earth.   --   We, therefore, the delegates with plenary powers of the people of Texas, in solemn convention assembled, appealing to a candid world for the necessities of our condition, do hereby resolve and declare, that our political connection with the Mexican nation has forever ended, and that the people of Texas do now constitute a free, Sovereign, and independent republic, and are fully invested with all the rights and attributes which properly belong to independent nations; and, conscious of the rectitude of our intentions, we fearlessly and confidently commit the issue to the decision of the Supreme arbiter of the destinies of nations.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenJohnCornyn/photos/a.112318184423.92543.75755694423/10155003214564424/?type=3",NA,340,145,84,32,2,0,0,6

The implication by some Democrats and liberal interest groups that her Catholic faith disqualifies her to serve should be completely rejected.

The First Baptist congregation, first responders, and Sutherland Springs community continue to be in my prayers.  As new details emerge from the ongoing investigation, we need to ask ourselves how this happened and what could’ve been done to prevent it. We know, for example, that the gunman was court martialed by the Air Force and convicted of serious domestic abuse.   This critically important information from the suspect’s criminal history was not uploaded into the relevant background check databases, even though federal law clearly requires that this be done. The Air Force has admitted that the gunman’s conviction should’ve barred him from ever possessing firearms. But because there was no record of his conviction, he was able to lie his way into acquiring them.  According to the FBI, the number of relevant records that are uploaded to the national database is staggeringly low. This is unacceptable and must change. I plan to introduce legislation to ensure that all federal departments and agencies, including the Department of Defense, upload the required conviction records into the national database.","status",NA,NA,1566,1180,154,71,11,7,217,165

I introduced the Fix NICS Act with bipartisan support this week to fix this systemic problem by requiring federal agencies and states to produce NICS implementation plans focused on uploading all information to the background check system showing that a person is prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms under current law. It will also hold federal agencies that fail to upload relevant records accountable and reward states who comply with their NICS implementation plans through federal grant preferences and incentives. Fix NICS will also increase accountability through public reporting for states who do not comply with implementation plans.   We must all do our part to prevent another disaster like Sutherland Springs from happening again. Thanks to Senators Scott, Hatch, and Heller for the support.
