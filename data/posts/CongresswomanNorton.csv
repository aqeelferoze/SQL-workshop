The New Year is a good time for collective D.C. resolutions that set new plans and goals for D.C. statehood.  There is no more worthy goal than building on the progress we made last year for D.C. statehood—the city’s effort that prepared for statehood by meeting all the prerequisites with a statehood vote and the largest number of cosponsors ever for our D.C. statehood bill.  Although we had a pro-statehood, Democratic president, our 2016 efforts came from officials and residents in the city and the Congress, not from our president. And they came despite a Republican-controlled House and Senate.  We need the president as an advocate using his or her bully pulpit, but there is no escaping the work that remains in D.C., in the nation, and in the Congress if statehood is to be achieved.  Working with the tools we can control is our best alternative for 2017.  Fortunately, the disappointing 2016 election has little to do with the statehood challenges we still have to meet.  Barring a revolutionary change in the makeup of Congress, we still would have faced striving, at minimum, for budget autonomy and setting new records for the number of cosponsors for D.C. statehood, no matter who was president.  Both are goals, but neither of these is a plan.  Now is the time to spell out new achievable statehood goals for 2017, just as we did for 2016.  Reaching a consensus and buy-in on tangible plan for achieving these goals would build on the statehood progress D.C. made in 2016.","status",NA,NA,123,11,3,6,0,0,1,0

On the House floor, I detailed just a few of the worst of the worst poison pills in #TrumpCare.  The Affordable Care Act has given D.C. near universal health insurance coverage.  Democrats have long been ready to work with Republicans on inevitable and necessary fixes to the ACA.  But instead of fixing the ACA’s flaws, #Trumpcare would gut the ACA and double the number of uninsured D.C. residents.  Millions of the poorest Americans would lose life-saving Medicaid assistance, while taxes for the wealthiest Americans would be slashed.  Cruelest of all is #Trumpcare’s unconscionable work requirements for Medicaid—whose recipients often claim benefits after lost income from being sick.  If Republicans get away with passing this monstrous bill, I will be fighting over in the Senate to make sure it does not get to President Trump’s desk.","video","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanNorton/videos/10154505588645658/",NA,187,13,37,30,2,0,0,0

Now, even Republicans want to revisit the debacle of last week, when they were forced to withdraw their Trumpcare bill.  The effect of Trumpcare on the District of Columbia would have been particularly harmful, considering that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has brought our city to virtual universal coverage (only 3.5% not covered).  Beyond that, the untold story about Trumpcare is its negative effect on employer-based healthcare insurance coverage.  Most Americans, including D.C. residents, get their coverage through their employers.  With the individual mandate no longer required under Trumpcare, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said fewer employees would have chosen to be covered.  Ominously, CBO estimated that 7 million fewer employees who currently get insurance through their employer would have chosen coverage, and ultimately fewer employers would have offered coverage to their workers.  Any major bill, like Obamacare, needs regular tailoring, such as lowering deductibles and the cost of premiums.  Working with Democrats, as even President Trump has suggested, is the only way forward now.","status",NA,NA,42,6,8,4,0,0,0,0

As chair of the CBC Judicial Nominations Working Group, I wrote our testimony after doing a thorough search of Gorsuch’s entire record.  However, because the CBC represents 17 million African Americans, I focused on Gorsuch’s record on discrimination, race, and related areas.  Gorsuch has a telling legal past—first as Principal Deputy to the Associate Attorney General at the Department of Justice (DOJ), with jurisdiction over the Civil Rights Division.  The DOJ Inspector General found politicized hiring to stifle civil rights enforcement under Gorsuch’s watch at the Civil Rights Division.  A Georgia voter ID law, which was precleared by the DOJ, was later overturned by a court, which compared the voter ID law to a Jim Crow-era poll tax.  Around the same time, Gorsuch wrote an op-ed piece advising “liberals to kick their addiction to the courtroom” and rely on “the ballot box.”  These views could alarm minorities of every background, whose rights have depended on the courts.  Gorsuch has gone on to give broadly worded anti-discrimination statutes a cramped interpretation.  Judge Gorsuch’s record as a judge on the 10th Circuit, his anti-civil rights record at the DOJ, and his distaste for litigation to vindicate equal rights together show that he has not earned the support of African Americans or the U.S. Senate.","status",NA,NA,52,24,22,1,0,0,0,7

I was proud to cosponsor the legislation and manage debate time on the House floor for Democrats.  Metropolitan Police Department Chief Peter Newsham has confirmed that the attacks against the protesters were unprovoked.  There are also videos of the peaceful protesters being assaulted by Turkish officials.  The protesters and our government deserve an appropriate response from the Turkish government.  Instead, we have received a far-fetched shifting of blame.  We must continue to insist on the necessary response from the Turkish government, particularly considering that the most recent conduct of Turkish officials has become an unacceptable pattern.  A similar incident occurred a half dozen years ago at the United Nations, with the same head of state, and security thugs attacking peaceful protesters.  Last year, there was an attack by Turkish security on journalists outside of the Brookings Institution here.  If we do not find a way to get the attention of the Turkish government, the evidence is that they will persist.  We know who the Turkish security personnel are.  They could not have gotten into the United States accompanying a head of state without identification.  Moreover, two of them were arrested, and we would know their names from the arrest records.  I have written Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to ask him to bar the reentry of these personnel; to hold them if they are still here; to request information on whether they are entitled to immunity; and, if they are, to have this immunity waved.  We must not let Turkey and its security personnel hide behind diplomatic immunity after three unprovoked violent responses to peaceful protesters.  These security personnel should be charged and prosecuted under our laws.  We would have expected precisely the same if some of our security had behaved in this fashion in Turkey.  There will be no justice for our citizens exercising their First Amendment rights who were stomped, kicked, and seriously injured, until they and our country are vindicated with an appropriate response from the Turkish government.","status",NA,NA,83,1,5,8,0,0,0,0

We continue to flatter ourselves as we say our country has a history of welcoming immigrants. As a matter of fact, the only immigrants our country has welcomed are African American slaves. Yet, we have now assimilated millions of immigrants and embraced our better selves as a proud nation of immigrants.  The District of Columbia and our other sanctuary cities are doing the opposite of what our country did in 1939. We are welcoming and protecting immigrants who come to from all over the world.

That is why I have predicted they would be unable to repeal and replace Obamacare.  A health care bill is major legislation that implicates one-sixth of the U.S. economy.  Only Democrats have any experience in passing legislation that makes such big structural changes.  Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, for example, are all Democratic initiatives.  Republicans believe that most of what Americans need should be provided only by the private sector.  That is why they opposed Obamacare.  With their bluff now called, they are having trouble repealing, much less replacing.  The American people have never lost a major benefit once granted.  The time is overdue for Republicans to understand that Americans will not relinquish precious health care benefits and that the only recourse now is to come to the table with Democrats to achieve the necessary changes to Obamacare.","status",NA,NA,120,12,19,6,0,5,0,0

At the service, I spoke for two of the movements that Dick called his own—civil rights for African Americans and statehood for the District of Columbia.  Below are my brief remarks.  “I suspect families of loves ones did not invite Dick Gregory to speak at services like this one unless they were prepared to have the congregation laugh out loud.  And I imagine my friend would have no objection if we did the same today.  “In the movement, we used to cry and shout and roar against racism.  Dick did us one better—he made racism look absurd.  With his brilliant crossover talent, Dick even made White folks laugh at their own racism.  While we were laughing our brains out, Dick had the uncanny ability to maintain a straight face.  That too took talent.  “After all, Dick Gregory was a very serious man.  Dick was out front in so many movements for justice—you got to know that your struggle had arrived when Dick Gregory joined it.  “Even when Dick was at the zenith of his profession as an artist, even when his satire, jokes and stories focused only about the world around him, Dick Gregory was always centered by his sense of justice—until it finally took over his life.  “Hanging in my office, filled with D.C. photographs, is one I tweeted when Dick passed depicting D.C.’s struggle for home rule showing a young Dick Gregory near the head of the crowd at a home rule march on the Mall in 1960s, long before I was elected to Congress.  “Dick had a home in D.C. and died in D.C.  That made sense to us.  After all, Dick Gregory was drawn to injustice the way D.C. residents are drawn to statehood.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanNorton/photos/a.471853260657.254642.61731840657/10154997870110658/?type=3",NA,53,3,9,11,0,0,0,0

Today’s all-but-sure defeat of the latest and worst version of #Trumpcare, thanks to the courage of Senator John McCain, is a win for the American people. The next step for Congress must be a return to regular order with hearings and debate so we can pass bipartisan fixes to Obamacare that will reduce costs and build on our progress in providing healthcare to all Americans as a right, not a privilege.","status",NA,NA,89,4,9,7,0,1,0,2

That is ICE’s job, and it has nothing to do with sanctuary cities. What Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions want is for sanctuary cities to detain and hand over to ICE people in state or local custody. However, several courts have held that “detainers,” or requests from ICE to hold immigrants in custody after their release date, or those who may be in state or local custody, for example for minor infractions such as traffic violations or shoplifting, violate the Fourth Amendment. The people arrested last week were located by ICE in open society, not under state or local custody. Sanctuary cities do not interfere with federal officials from ICE. All they are asking is that ICE not interfere with them.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigration/trump-administration-targets-sanctuary-cities-in-latest-wave-of-immigration-arrests/2017/09/28/9b5e7de2-a477-11e7-ade1-76d061d56efa_story.html?utm_term=.ccf480bf17bc","washingtonpost.com",34,6,20,0,0,2,4,24

After Americans heard her history-making story, they headed to the polls in 1992 and tripled the number of women to the Senate and elected a record number of women to the House (24 new members). Anita Hill's bravery and poise continue to inspire women to stand up as sexual harassment leads headlines.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanNorton/photos/a.471853260657.254642.61731840657/10155148292345658/?type=3",NA,481,33,81,126,0,2,1,0

DC would not have one of the highest HIV rates in the country, if the Republican Congress had not banned needle exchange for our city for 10 years.  That deadly amendment cost us thousands of DC lives.  Newly diagnosed HIV cases attributable to injection drug use in DC decreased from 149 cases in 2007 to 7 cases in 2016.  We are close to eliminating the drug-use pathway for HIV.  Safe sex, universal testing and other preventative measures remain vital for progress to continue.  The number of newly diagnosed HIV cases in DC has decreased by 52% in the last five years.  Let’s keep it up.  We can do this!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanNorton/photos/a.471853260657.254642.61731840657/10155185447675658/?type=3",NA,51,10,15,11,0,0,2,0

D.C. homeowners together can save millions of dollars by prepaying their 2018 property taxes by midnight, tonight, December 31.  Typically, local jurisdictions will not asses properties for 2018 until 2018, but D.C. had to submit its full budget, including property assessments, before October 1, the start of the federal fiscal year for ultimate approval by Congress.  Following the Republican tax bill, the rush began to prepay property taxes until Americans realized the essential ingredient for prepayments—their property assessments—was missing.  However, D.C. residents, who join me in the annual struggle to keep Congress out of our business, can turn the tables if they act by midnight.  They can mitigate the increased taxes many homeowners face as a result of the $10,000 cap placed on state and local tax deductions in the Republican tax bill.  The resulting double taxation is a bitter pill D.C. homeowners do not need to swallow—at least this year.

We need to hear from D.C. residents who have benefitted from the ACA, including those with employer-provided insurance, seniors, women, and Medicaid enrollees. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, more than 96 percent of D.C. residents now have health insurance, and only three states have lower rates of uninsured residents than the District.  Below is a list of comprehensive consequences of repealing the ACA for D.C. residents:  The 106,000 D.C. residents who have pre-existing health conditions would be at risk of having their coverage rescinded, being denied coverage, or being charged significantly more for coverage.  Women who can now purchase insurance for the same price as men would be at risk of being charged more for insurance.  Before the ACA, women paid up to 32% more than men for their health insurance.  281,235 D.C. residents who now have private health insurance that covers preventive services without any co-pays, coinsurance, or deductibles stand to lose this access if the ACA provisions requiring health insurers to cover important preventive services without cost-sharing are eliminated.  46,684 D.C. seniors who have received preventive care services without cost thanks to ACA provisions requiring coverage of annual wellness visits and eliminating cost-sharing for many recommended preventive services covered by Medicare Part B, such as cancer screenings, would be at risk of losing access to these services.  Individuals who are 26 and under would no longer be able to stay on their parents’ health care plans.  D.C. would be at risk of losing $464 million in federal Medicaid dollars if the Medicaid expansion was eliminated.","event","https://www.facebook.com/events/1403902426320668/",NA,107,1,0,2,0,0,0,0
