Graduates in the STEM fields have the potential to develop technologies that could save lives, jump-start new industries, or even discover new worlds.  Young girls should be empowered at an early age to engage and lead in NASA and in these innovative fields.  Our 21st Century economy calls for a next generation of students who are skilled in the STEM fields and can be leaders in our nation’s innovation economy.  This legislation spurs a number of initiatives at NASA that will provide more resources to young girls and women who aspire to succeed as scientists, engineers, astronauts, mathematicians, and in many other STEM careers.  Recently, a movie was released detailing a few of the unsung heroes of NASA.  This movie, Hidden Figures, highlights the moving story of the group of African-American women who worked at NASA as mathematicians and battled discrimination during the Space Race.  The INSPIRE Women Act will afford opportunities to a future generation of women leaders who will have a similar impact on our nation’s history and maybe, one day, put a woman on Mars.","link","https://comstock.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-comstock-s-bipartisan-inspire-women-act-passes-house","comstock.house.gov",59,9,15,5,0,0,0,0

I will work with my colleagues to enact policy that will allow for a wide choice of health care plans that include coverage for those who have preexisting conditions and allow young adults to stay on their parent’s plans until age 26 while encouraging health care innovation and more choice and control in the hands of patients.  Obamacare exchanges have collapsed around the country while wasting hundreds of millions on this failed project, while many major insurers have left the exchanges where many now find few choices.  The current health insurance system is not working for millions of individuals, families, and small businesses who have seen their premiums skyrocket – after they were told they would decrease, and deductibles increase so that people often can’t afford to use their plans. Experts have reported that consumers in one-third of the country are forced to buy from a single Obamacare insurer. That’s not choice – that’s a monopoly.  And fines and penalties face those who can’t afford these more expensive plans, as well as twenty-one different health care taxes.  We now have the opportunity to stop the harm done by the current health care system, provide a smooth transition, and provide the patient-centered, affordable care all Americans deserve.","status",NA,NA,183,183,23,10,0,0,1,65

We appreciate the hundreds of people we met with and talked to -- from a variety of viewpoints -- who shared their genuine concerns and health care experiences with us.  While this bill addressed important principles like covering pre-existing conditions and not having lifetime limits imposed on the sick, and reducing costs and increasing choices for many working families, the uncertainties in the current version of the bill caused me not to be able to support it today.  The ACA is in a death spiral that Democrats refuse to acknowledge, and it is failing many families and individuals who struggle with skyrocketing premiums, higher deductibles, and less choice. We've heard from people with crushing $1800 a month premiums and thousands and thousands in uncompensated care under Obamacare.  We've heard from people who lost their insurance because of Obamacare and couldn't afford the exchanges and were forced to pay fines for not purchasing unaffordable healthcare.  This year it is anticipated that more providers will abandon the exchanges or hike rates by double digits. This is unsustainable and I am still committed to a 21st century health care system that will help working families get better and more affordable health care.  We can continue to work on reform initiatives. Just this week we voted on two health care insurance reform bills which should get to the President's desk as quickly as possible to provide relief.","link","https://comstock.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/comstock-statement-ahca","comstock.house.gov",120,295,22,9,15,2,3,39

The work they have done is extraordinary and it was instructive to see how they work together to meet the challenges of the refugee population and the region, and to bring more stability to the Mideast. We met with the mothers, fathers, teachers, health care providers, and children at the refugee camps and heard from them about life in these camps and the desire of the refugees to be able to go home, and the vital support they still need.

Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun is the main cause of skin cancer. UV damage can also cause wrinkles and blotches or spots on your skin. The good news is that skin cancer can be prevented, and it can almost always be cured when it's found and treated early.

I do support the proposed increases for our nation’s defense, but we have to evaluate as a Congress if we need even more resources to meet the national security threats that face our country. This budget puts an end to the harmful Obama era defense sequestration cuts that not only hampered our military readiness, but also negatively impacted Virginia, leading to zero GDP growth in 2014 and a paltry 0.6% growth in 2015.  As Chairwoman of the Research and Technology Subcommittee, I was also pleased to see support for cyber security within the budget through the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies.  We continue to see elevated cyber threats against our country and we must properly support our national security, homeland security, and defense programs that address cybersecurity.  The budget also includes the federal government’s commitment to Metro by providing much-needed capital funding.  Earlier this month, in the FY 2017 government funding bill, I was able to work with my colleagues and include the federal government’s statutory obligation to Metro by meeting its $150 million obligation to provide a dollar-for-dollar match in combination with Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia for Metro’s capital budget and this budget continues that commitment.     Another priority of mine has always been to look out for our hardworking federal employees.  This budget unfairly burdens our federal employees with benefit and budget cuts.  We cannot balance the federal budget on the backs of our federal workers.  Many of our federal employees work at the CIA, Pentagon, FBI, law enforcement, homeland security and intelligence agencies.  They are dedicated professionals who are working day and night for the American people.      Since coming to Congress I have worked to support medical research at the National Institutes of Health, science research, disease prevention, combating the opioid epidemic, Chesapeake Bay cleanup, and more.  Unfortunately, this proposed budget does not reflect those priorities and many of the priorities of my District.  As Congress begins its work on the FY 2018 budget, I will be working with my colleagues and constituents on a budget that reflects those priorities and includes support for these and other important programs that are vital to my District.","link","https://comstock.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-comstock-statement-administration-s-proposed-fy-2018-budget","comstock.house.gov",76,82,4,0,0,4,1,9

Lyme disease is the fastest spreading tick-borne disease in the U.S. with an estimated 300,000 new cases each year. I’ve consistently supported the appropriations for the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program on Tick-Borne Diseases, which this year received $5 million in the appropriations bill that passed earlier this month.   In the last Congress I cosponsored H.R. 789, Tick-Borne Disease Research Accountability and Transparency Act of 2015, which required the Department of Health and Human Services to support epidemiological, basic, translational, and clinical research regarding Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases.  H.R. 789, was largely incorporated into the 21st Century Cures package that passed last year.  The legislation also called for the formation of the Tick-Borne Disease Working Group prior to its incorporation into 21st Century Cures.  I did this because identifying stronger diagnostic tools, better data collection, and subsequent research remain crucial in both providing appropriate treatment and raising awareness for early detection.

Then Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote these poignant words to the brave forces that were about to embark on this seminal battle:  Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Force!  You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts, you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.  Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle hardened. He will fight savagely. But this is the year 1944! Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41. The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground.Our Home Fronts have given us an superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned! The free men of the world marching together to Victory!  I have full confidence in your devotion to duty and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full Victory!  Good Luck! And let us all beseech blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking. - General Dwight D. Eisenhower","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBarbaraComstock/photos/a.1557244737853240.1073741828.1554726914771689/1932255490352161/?type=3",NA,59,14,14,0,0,0,4,0

These bills address the problem that criminal aliens who are deported but return over and over again, and continue their criminal activities in our community.  Just last week, I went on a ride along with our Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force where four such criminal aliens were taken into custody by ICE.  The background of just one of these criminals was chilling:  He was a 22-year old male covered in MS-13 gang tattoos, and he had been in jail in El Salvador for murder as a teenager, and had been deported twice from the U.S.  In the U.S. he also engaged in violent crime.  Yet he was standing free on our streets last Friday night in Sterling Park. Thanks to the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force, he is no longer out on our streets.  However, we know there are at least an estimated 4,000 MS-13 and other gang members in our region.  We need to provide law enforcement with the tools to remove them from our communities.  Over the last six months, at least eight murders have been committed and tied to MS-13 and other gangs, a 166% increase over last year.  I am currently working on additional legislation to battle these criminals by providing additional resources for our regional gang task forces.  The Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task force works with the communities in our region and roots out alleged gang members through direct enforcement, prevention, and educational programs and they must be properly funded in order to do their jobs and protect our communities.","status",NA,NA,229,61,14,18,1,2,1,13

These brave men and woman either paid the ultimate sacrifice or were wounded in action defending our freedoms.

Abrakadoodle is a woman owned company that brings art classes onsite to schools and community centers like the McLean Community Center. Franchise owners in Virginia provide 238,000 jobs and $8.6 billion in payroll and $21.1 billion in revenue.   We discussed bipartisan legislation, HR 3441, the Save Local Business Act, which I have cosponsored and provides needed support and legal certainty for franchise owners and businesses who are often subject to frivolous lawsuits. In 2015, the Obama National Labor Relations Board  handed down a new joint-employer standard that radically rewrote U.S. labor law and upended thousands of business relationships. The NLRB opinion threw out three decades of legal precedent that protected these small business owners and was estimated to kill 1.7 million jobs.   H.R. 3441 restores the previous bipartisan law that had existed for decades.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBarbaraComstock/photos/a.1557244737853240.1073741828.1554726914771689/1972340283010348/?type=3",NA,42,1,5,1,2,0,0,0

I support building more statues and adding to our history; not tearing down statues or erasing our history.  Our community has been adding to our local African American history through efforts at sites such as Oatlands Plantation, Manassas National Battlefield Park, The Shenandoah Valley Civil War Museum, The Journey Through Hallowed Ground, Josephine City, and many more of our local museums and historic sites, cemeteries, and battlefields where more context, explanation, and preservation will continue.  I have worked with our community in support of these efforts which I believe demonstrate that we are at our best when we bring our diverse community together and call upon the ‘better angels of our nature’ to educate, illuminate, and stop the division.”","status",NA,NA,307,180,30,23,0,0,7,68

The legislation will provide additional tools to our law enforcement to combat the transnational MS-13 street gang.  It will ensure that when ICE positively identifies a known alien gang member, they may act immediately.  This legislation identifies gang membership and participation in gang activity as grounds for inadmissibility and removability from the country.  In Northern Virginia there have been at least eight brutal murders tied to the transnational MS-13 gang since last November. The Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force believes that 3-4,000 MS-13 gang members are in our region and, at a town festival in Herndon earlier this year, the gang task force estimated 200-300 suspected gang members were milling about among families attending the community event.  This legislation will make our communities safer by helping to rid gang members from our communities.  I have also introduced H.R. 3249, the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act, which would establish a grant program to provide resources to state and local entities to curb the rise in gang activity and violence.  This legislation authorizes $70 million annually for FY2018 through FY2022.  Twenty percent of the authorized $70 million will go directly to already-established gang task forces, like the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force, who are experiencing elevated transnational gang activity from gangs such as MS-13.

To create a healthy economy we must put more money back into the hands of hard working taxpayers.  The last time the tax code was reformed was in 1986. As I travel throughout the District I hear from families and businesses both large and small that they want a tax code that is more efficient, effective, and accountable.  America’s corporate tax rate at 35% is the highest among developed countries and this framework will significantly decrease that tax rate to 20% so business can grow and expand leading to more jobs here at home.    I am also pleased to see an expanded child tax credit included in the framework since it has been over a decade since the child tax credit was last expanded. I have introduced H.R. 383, the Expanded Child Tax Credit Act which would double the current tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child so that families will have more money in their pockets. I have also cosponsored H.R. 3632, the Promoting Affordable Childcare for Everyone (PACE) Act which will help middle class and low-income families with tax credits for childcare, and I hope to see this included in the final package given the high cost of childcare for two earner families.

About 6 million pet dogs develop many of the same cancers as kids do, and nearly half of them will die from their disease. Researchers are studying to see if Man’s Best Friend could help “Crack the Cure” for Childhood Cancer. In July we passed, H.R. 1231, RACE for Children Act (Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity for Children Act), and I have introduced, The Kids First Research Act 2.0’, a bill which will provide additional funding to ramp up the needed research for childhood cancer and other disorders that strike our children.  We appreciate the leadership from these groups in assisting our efforts.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepBarbaraComstock/photos/a.1557244737853240.1073741828.1554726914771689/1989200197991023/?type=3",NA,38,6,1,2,1,0,0,0

This legislation would protect unborn children after 20 weeks gestation, except in cases of incest, rape, and the life of the mother.  Currently, the United States is one of only seven nations that allow elective late term abortions after 20 weeks gestation, putting us in the dubious company of countries such as China and North Korea. In many developed nations, including western European countries, abortion is limited after 14 weeks and countries such as France and Germany have limitations starting at 12 weeks.

According to the Washington Post, these devices came onto the market in 2010 during the Obama Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) approved the device without any regulations.  Therefore, earlier today I joined my colleagues in a letter to ATF Acting Director Thomas E. Brandon for the bureau to re-evaluate this decision about bump stocks and other similar mechanisms that is expressly designed to simulate the automatic rate of fire of a machinegun.

The status quo is driving businesses and jobs away and we have to modernize our tax code to meet the challenges of our innovative 21st century economy.    This bill will jumpstart businesses of all sizes and get wages rising again and put more money in the paychecks of our constituents and provide more opportunity for all.  The legislation simplifies the individual rate structure, reducing from seven brackets to four, and doubles the standard deduction for non-itemizers.  The 401(k) and the charitable deductions provisions in the tax code remain to protect and promote savings for retirement and the AMT tax is completely eliminated, which currently affects tens of thousands in the 10th District.   I am also pleased that this tax reform package included our hard fought provisions to increase the child tax credit from a current $1,000 that phases out currently at $110k to an increased $1,600 per child tax credit that goes up to $230k for families.  The bill also provides an additional $600 credit for parents which means a total of $3800 tax credit for a family of four (2 parents, 2 kids). This bill also preserves the important Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to help two earner families care for children and older dependents such as disabled grandparents.  The adoption tax credit is also maintained in this bill.  The process still continues.  The critics oppose tax reform without providing alternative or detailed solutions, while wages stagnate and innovation and opportunities are slowed down.  I will continue to work to improve this bill as it proceeds through the process – in particular my concerns and those of my constituents about state and local tax deductions and the need for more support for home owners and those who will still itemize under a new system.  In the House bill we were able to preserve property deductions up to $10,000 for taxpayers who itemize but we still need to do more in revising provisions that will get more tax relief to individual taxpayers.   We also need to provide more support for our small businesses so that all will benefit from updating our tax code for the first time in 30 years.","link","https://comstock.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-comstock-statement-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act","comstock.house.gov",188,493,28,15,5,0,13,352

The mother of the victim, Maria Reyes, had brought her daughter, Damaris, to the United States from El Salvador at age 12 to escape MS-13, which menaces their country. But tragically her daughter had fallen in with members of the same gang that is resurging in our area.

This legislation we passed here today is a strong first step in fundamentally reforming how we address the insidious problem of sexual harassment in the workplace and committing to a healthy, safe working environment free from sexual harassment.  As a Mom, former intern, former Congressional staffer and counsel and Justice Department employee, and now a Member of Congress on the Committee that will reform this process, this is truly a watershed moment for those who serve in this body.  This resolution mandates educating our workforce in Congress, from Members to the interns, on preventing sexual harassment in the workplace and having zero tolerance for sexual predators.   This legislation promotes the essential principles of accountability and personal responsibility. It is bipartisan legislation, because bad behavior transcends party labels and predators come from both parties.  It is also important that men are joining women in this effort and we have a broad consensus for additional reforms.     This is just a first step.  Going forward, I will work to reform the reporting process for victims and provide them with an advocate such as a victim’s counsel or Ombudsmen.  There must be no taxpayer-funded settlements for accused Members of Congress and we need transparency and accountability in the process both going forward and in disclosing past settlements.  I support allowing victims who did make settlements with the opportunity to come forward without fear of consequences from non-disclosure agreements.  These and other reforms can and should be adopted as we move forward in providing fundamental reforms to provide a safe and healthy workplace for all.   Finally, I’d like to thank, Dorena Bertussi, who 30 years ago was the first woman to bravely step up to pursue a successful sexual harassment case against a Member of Congress.  I also thank her for her guidance in helping us address these issues today.

Metro is a system in crisis and we need serious reforms to move our region forward and provide the public with a safe and efficient transit system.  My office has collaborated with former Mayor Anthony Williams, and Federal City Council, as well as former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, former Virginia Transportation Secretary Jim Dyke, current Transportation Department officials including those with current Secretary Chao, General Manager Paul Wiedefeld along with others at WMATA, whistleblowers, and those affiliated with the successful efforts to turn the Boston transit system around and others.  Years of deferred maintenance, increasing budget deficits and decreasing ridership on Metro threatens the safety and reliability of the system.  Without significant reforms, the system will continue to decline and lose ridership and fail the nation’s capital which needs this vital system for the vitality of our local and national economy.  The riders who use the system and the taxpayers who help support it deserve much better.  This reform legislation reduces the use of overtime, shifts employees from a pension system to a 401k system (as recommended by the current manager), controls contract increases and promotes Metro ridership by improving reliability  This bill will create a Metro Reform Board, which will serve as an interim control entity to govern Metro in order to achieve the necessary changes in the near-term.  It will also establish a Metro Reform Commission, which will be an advisory commission whose purpose is to keep Congress and other relevant stakeholders informed of the progress of the efforts by the Signatories to increase efficiencies at the Authority, amend the interstate compact, and other relevant actions.  Whistleblower protections are also included in the bill for WMATA employees who fear retaliation from management.  I would like to thank the Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce, Greater Washington Board of Trade, and Federal City Council, all of whom have also contributed to this final product and expressed their support along with leaders of business and Capital regional groups.  It is critical that our region has a top-tier public transportation system on which the riding public can rely.  Commuters need a system that can get them to work quickly and safely so they can do their jobs.  Every day we see delays and incidents that affect our entire region, and this bill will put Metro on a path to fixing the systemic issues that plague riders every day.","link","https://comstock.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-barbara-comstock-introduces-metro-accountability-and-reform-act","comstock.house.gov",38,37,2,0,0,0,0,0

Dear Secretary Layne:   I write today regarding the outrage of my constituents about the exorbitant tolls on Interstate 66.  In 2015 when state Delegates said the tolls would be as high as $17 one way they were ridiculed as alarmist. Now we see actual implementation where it is more than twice that amount.   The new system that started on Monday results in commuters paying up to $40 one way to go ten miles. Governor McAuliffe made repeated assurances and commitments, that the toll rates would be reasonable. Numerous public documents advertised $6 to $7 tolls on average.  I support efforts by my former colleague, Delegate Tim Hugo, who plans to reverse this ill-conceived plan and craft a realistic public policy solution that helps lower the cost of commuting for single-occupancy vehicles on I-66 inside the beltway.   In the interim, I request written responses delivered to my office to the following questions by December 12th, 2017:  ·         People were told tolls were supposed to be only a few dollars, were these peaks in tolls of close to $40 expected to be the norm? ·         How many commuters have paid tolls so far and what is the current average versus what was expected prior to implementation? ·         How much revenue has been generated so far and what is the current average revenue versus what was expected prior to implementation? ·         Do the results warrant any additional modifications to the planned implementation to Transform I-66 and if so, what are possible contingency plans? ·         How does this compare to implementation of variable tolling on Interstate 495?   As a member of the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, I understand the need to increase highway capacity and promote mass transit and ride-sharing.  However, it is clear that this experiment with congestion pricing is not only highly unpopular, but it is not what was advertised.  There appears to be some major dishonesty with our taxpayers in how this was sold, promoted, and what the reality is.  They deserve a better explanation and better policy   Sincerely,  Barbara Comstock","link","https://comstock.house.gov/sites/comstock.house.gov/files/SecLayneTollLetter.pdf","comstock.house.gov",347,128,46,24,8,3,1,3

This legislation, which I cosponsored, provides concealed carry reciprocity for individuals with valid state issued permits or licenses, or for residents of states with a right to constitutional concealed carry.  This allows Virginia residents to continue to maintain their concealed carry rights when they cross state lines. Right now, current law creates confusion for people who cross state borders with a lawful concealed carry permit.  The legislation also incorporated the Fix the NICS Act (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) which I also cosponsored, which strengthens compliance with the NICS background check system to prevent criminals from getting firearms by requiring states and federal agencies to develop plans to ensure they are uploading all relevant records and information to prevent gun purchases by felons and others who are not allowed to purchase firearms.  Additionally, the measure would also penalize federal agencies that fail to fully report relevant records and it pushes states to improve their reporting timeliness and accuracy.

The hearing reviewed the results of the Head Health Challenge, a private-public partnership designed to develop innovative advanced materials to better improve protective equipment for sports, industry, military, and other users at high risk of head trauma.  The competition is cosponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and three private organizations: the National Football League, General Electric, and Under Armour.  The applicants were evaluated on a number of testing qualifications.  Each of the final five winners received $250,000 to advance their submissions and the final two grand prize co-winners – Dynamic Research and 6D Helmets, out of an original 125 submissions, will split an additional $500,000.  This competition is the third in a series over a four year, $60 million private-public collaboration.  “As a mother of children who have played sports and a grandmother, I am concerned about the short term and long term impacts of head trauma.  By incentivizing problem solvers to tackle these complex issues on preventing repetitive brain trauma, the government is catalyzing growth in new sciences and technologies, which will have wide impacts beyond the specific problem they are attempting to solve, not just for those who play sports, but also our men and women in the military and workers in dangerous jobs.  “As Dr. Alex Deghan, CEO and founder of Conservation X Labs said during his testimony, ‘Instead of looking for the needle in the haystack, we need to incentivize the needle to find you,’ by engaging in these competitions, Congress is encouraging development and innovation not just for the winners, but all the participants, who can produce innovative and novel breakthroughs.  “I was happy to showcase such innovation in the form of my constituent, Mr. Shawn Springs, a former Redskins player, and now CEO of Leesburg based Windpact, who is on the cutting edge of developing materials to prevent the physical damage from impacts and who offered his unique perspective on using private-public partnerships like the Head Health Challenge to spur innovation.  “I strongly believe that public-private science prize competition are invaluable to the advancement of player safety,” said Shawn Springs, CEO of Windpact and former Redskins player.  “Learning and accepting guidance from the medical community, our aim is to be the catalyst of innovation for impact protection technology so manufacturers can build better products for their customers.  “Windpact chose to make its headquarters in Loudoun County for multiple reasons. With all of the development in the area, we believe it is the next innovation hub. Additionally, its location is close to military and government offices, as well as the dense population of families and kids in the area playing sports, it made sense for us to be located in an area where we could make real connections to the communities we are working to protect.”","link","https://comstock.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-barbara-comstock-chairs-hearing-addressing-head-health-challenge","comstock.house.gov",15,25,0,0,0,0,0,1

This reform bill will make a number of necessary changes to bring about more transparency, accountability, stronger protections for employees, and a simplified, clear, and respectful process for individuals to report claims and reach a resolution. Ultimately, these reforms will bring the improved protections for individuals and accountability in the workplace.  While we are very close to finalizing these reforms, we will introduce legislation when Congress reconvenes in January. The Committee on House Administration will hold a markup as soon as Congress returns and will report the bill to the full House. Our position from the beginning of this review and reform process has been: One case of sexual harassment is one case too many. We need to get these reforms right and ensure we are paving a path forward for a safer and productive congressional workplace.","link","https://comstock.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/update-reforming-congressional-accountability-act-better-congressional","comstock.house.gov",30,24,2,0,3,0,0,4
