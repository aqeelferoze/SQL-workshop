Regular readers will not be surprised to learn recent Charlotte Observer coverage of a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of health care reform left out key facts.  In their own report, Kaiser admits their analysis doesn’t account for changes we made to allow larger tax credits for people over 50 and doesn’t account for flexibility we give states to make insurance more affordable within their markets.  The Observer also failed to mention Kaiser doesn’t account for $38 billion of assistance given to states to help lower costs.

Regarding pre-existing conditions, the House has provided funds totaling $138 billion to cover pre-existing conditions, mental health, and other conditions, which must still be covered by the states.  As well, since only 5 percent of North Carolinians buy insurance on the individual market, referring to the total number of North Carolinians with pre-existing conditions is misleading.

Local community banks traditionally catered to the small business market, but the Obama-era Dodd-Frank financial regulatory system smothered community banks and credit unions, leading North Carolina to lose 50% of our banks since 2010.  This makes it harder for small business owners to access the capital and credit needed to expand and create jobs.  Earlier this month, my House Committee on Financial Services colleagues and I passed common sense legislation to properly regulate the financial system while providing relief to community banks, which in turn will help small businesses and job growth.

For any country that supports the brutal North Korean regime, there will be a punitive response from the United States.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-sanctions-chinese-and-russian-companies-and-individuals-for-conducting-business-with-north-korea/2017/08/22/78992312-8743-11e7-961d-2f373b3977ee_story.html?utm_term=.9a7d817cfe6e","washingtonpost.com",22,11,7,3,1,0,0,0
