I have met with thousands of NY-24 individuals and families, small business owners, farmers, veterans, and community organizations since being sworn in to represent our district in January 2015.  During that time, my office has responded to nearly 64,000 constituent letters, emails and phone calls.  I’ve hosted 6 community listening sessions and numerous telephone town hall events.  With my support, NY-24 has been awarded millions of dollars in federal grants, and I’ve been able to ensure that nearly $2 million dollars owed in federal benefits were returned to Central New York residents.  When my constituents contact me or my office, we listen, and we focus on getting results and representing you in the most effective way possible.  Because I enjoy and value interaction with Central New Yorkers, I’m distressed by the efforts of a small number of people to create disruptions that make such interaction more difficult.  Over the course of the past month, a national political movement called ""Indivisible"" has developed across the country.  This is a group fueled by outside, progressive interests.   While many involved with this movement claim to be interested in productive, public discourse with their federal representatives, the ""Indivisible"" playbook instructs just the opposite.  It suggests ""Indivisible"" members bombard Members of Congress with phone calls and encourages disruptive behavior at townhall meetings and district events, specifically instructing individuals to ""object as loudly and powerfully as possible,"" warns they must ""be prepared to interrupt,"" and encourages ""booing"" and ""chanting.""  In several forums in other parts of the country, ""Indivisible"" followers have dutifully followed this playbook, and have turned opportunities for constructive engagement between citizens and their representatives into unruly spectacles where constructive engagement is impossible.    Here in Central New York, multiple progressive organizations have aligned themselves with the national ‘Indivisible’ movement.   I respect the right of these groups to peacefully assemble, meet, and protest.  I appreciate their passion.  I have spoken with numerous CNY ""Indivisible"" members, and invited them to meet regularly with my office to ensure their concerns are heard.  Having spoken with several of these individuals, I have seen that many of them are sincere, and truly want to engage in a constructive conversation.  I have and will continue to make myself available to such individuals.  Unfortunately, others have made very clear that their foremost goal is to cause disruptions.  They have harassed members of my staff with threatening and aggressive phone calls and office visits.  Some behavior has even led to security concerns.  While we work with Capitol Police and local law enforcement, this behavior impedes our ability to serve.  I will not allow a national outside group to hijack service to my district or disrupt meaningful engagement with my constituents.  Let me be clear:  These individuals are preventing members of my staff from helping refugees, senior citizens, and veterans.  By flooding my office with hundreds of calls and holding regular protests, they are only hurting their neighbors – veterans in need of VA Hospital care, seniors dependent on Social Security and Medicare, individuals facing pressing immigration matters, and local organizations seeking to apply for federal grants.   We live in a politically charged time.  I work every day to heal our divide and bring our country and community together.  I have a record of working across the aisle, and getting things done for my district.  I will always make myself available to my constituents.  All 708,000 of them.  I will also represent them equally.  A farmer in Wayne County or steel worker in Auburn matter just as much to me as an enraged ‘Indivisible’ member.      I have and will continue to engage in an ongoing dialogue with the constituents that I represent across Onondaga, Cayuga, Wayne, and Oswego Counties.  But I will not allow a small, yet vocal, group dictate the terms on which I do so.","status",NA,NA,236,433,134,23,1,6,7,144

Since being elected to represent Central New York in Congress, I have heard from countless farmers across Onondaga, Wayne, Cayuga, and Oswego counties about the disastrous impact this would have on small family farms.  I have long voiced my concern with this ambiguous rule and supported legislation in the House to withdraw it.

Large insurers are pulling out of exchanges; co-ops are failing, premiums are skyrocketing; and deductibles are high.  Left untouched, Obamacare will collapse and American healthcare consumers will be the victims.  My position on Obamacare has been clear since I first ran for office in 2014: we need to repeal or radically restructure the law, and have a replacement ready at the time we do so.  Despite some promising reforms, I do not support the proposal before the House in its current form. This bill represents only the first step of a long process of healthcare reform and it is not at all clear what the final form will look like.  Substantial future administrative and legislative action would be needed. Fundamentally, I don't believe this proposal provides an adequate market-based option for insurance access, nor does it address out-of-control costs.  Further, I am confident the proposal would harm hospitals across my district.  Hurting New York State, to benefit other regions does not sit well with me. The Administration and Leaders in Congress deserve credit for starting this process.  But we should take the time to ensure a viable market-based alternative to Obamacare is ready simultaneous with the repeal.

This agreement is far from perfect, but it advances some significant priorities for Central New York and for our country.  This measure prioritizes our national security by increasing funding for defense and strengthening border security.

In the case where financially stressed student loan borrowers have no other option but to seek bankruptcy relief, these individuals are unable to discharge their student loan debt.  While this is a last option for many, it should not be the case that student loan debt is the only form of debt that cannot be discharged and the measure that I’ve put forth with Congressman John K.

I recognize, and agree with the President, that drastic reductions in troop levels or a rapid exit from Afghanistan would create a vacuum, allowing terrorism to flourish in an already vulnerable, unstable region.  President Obama attempted this strategy by pulling out of Iraq, which quickly resulted in an ISIS takeover of broad swaths in both Iraq and Syria. We must not make that mistake again.  Additionally, as the father of a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Army just beginning his military career, I strongly and personally believe that our servicemen and women deserve a clear plan for success going forward.  Last night, I believe the President outlined a multifaceted approach to begin to bring stability to the region, to eliminate terrorism, to finally stand up to countries like Pakistan which allow terrorism to germinate, and to keep our country safe.","status",NA,NA,144,102,10,10,2,3,1,24

After all, this is the water that we drink, bathe our children and swim in.    The City of Syracuse has assured residents that tap water from the Lake remains safe to drink at this time.  It is vital that continuous monitoring takes place to ensure that the water remains safe, and that the City communicates clearly and often about the status of the water supply.

The bill introduced in the House today is a starting point for desperately-needed action on tax reform.    For thirty years, progressives have demanded exactly what this bill does – easing of the tax burden on low and middle income working families and eliminating loopholes.  Anyone who dismisses this bill outright should be prepared to explain this discrepancy, and detail why hardworking Americans should continue to be taxed at excessive rates.  No bill is perfect, which is why we need to keep this process moving forward.  As this measure moves through the House over the coming weeks, I will continue to consult with individuals, families, small businesses and manufacturers across my district and seek their feedback.  As I always have, I will advocate in Congress to ensure that this measure is a net win for Central New York.","status",NA,NA,126,231,6,5,14,1,5,59
