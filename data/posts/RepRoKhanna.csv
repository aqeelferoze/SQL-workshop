Because she has a family history of cancer, Lori was proactive about her health care prior to the diagnosis and got regular checkups and mammograms, which she credits with saving her life. After treatment, she was tested for the BRCA gene mutation and learned that as a carrier, she has an 87% chance of developing breast cancer and a 50% chance of developing ovarian cancer. Lori worries that under the #GOPHealthcareBill, having a genetic mutation could be considered a preexisting condition. Lori knows that genetic testing can lead to behaviors that help catch diseases in their early stages, meaning the difference between life and death. She also knows that if people are denied access to healthcare based on genetics, they will die. As science advances and we develop new tools to evaluate risk, we must make sure that these tools are used to provide better care, not deny it. I’m fighting for Lori and her family. The ACA restriction on insurance providers denying health insurance based on pre-existing conditions must stay in place.","status",NA,NA,76,7,9,2,0,0,7,0

Luckily both parents are covered by the Affordable Care Act, so the family’s medical expenses were a fraction of the total cost. The ACA gives Shannon the peace of mind that her child will get the affordable health care he deserves to grow up healthy and strong. Now, that sense of security is on the line.

Shareholders and corporate executives do not need any more favors handed to them. Instead, Congress should commit to a reform plan that encourages economic gains by making the tax code fair for working families. I am also disappointed to see that Trump’s tax plan does away with the state and local tax deduction, which places a greater burden on the residents of California.   One solution we should be looking at is increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit so it benefits more families and individuals. Earlier this month, Sen. Sherrod Brown, myself, and 50 House members introduced the Grow American Incomes Now Act. The GAIN Act roughly doubles the EITC for working families and increases the credit for childless workers almost sixfold. It would have a lasting impact on the American economy.","link","http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/09/27/trump-gop-roll-out-tax-plan-cuts-rates-doubles-deduction/","mercurynews.com",26,18,7,1,1,0,1,17

Compare that to the top 1% who will receive 83% of the gains in 2027, with the top 0.1% getting 60% of those benefits. This is flawed policy that will increase income inequality in our nation even further.

I will continue to fight in Congress for legislation that helps working families, like the GAIN Act, my bill with Senate companion Sen. Sherrod Brown, that roughly doubles the earned income tax credit for working families and increases the credit for childless workers almost sixfold.
