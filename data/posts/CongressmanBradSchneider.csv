More than 70 years after the world initially bore witness to the horrors of the Holocaust, it is increasingly important for us to honor the memory of the six million Jews and millions of other innocents systematically murdered by the Nazi machine. We must consciously remember them, and the survivors, to ensure the world never forgets the evil that perpetrated such heinous crimes, and to ensure the lessons of the Shoah are passed on from generation to generation.   We are all obliged to carry forth the legacy of those that perished and those that survived by confronting persecution in all its forms and in all its places, so that people of all faiths and ethnicities may freely live their lives and practice their faiths with confidence and dignity. Only through remembrance, through study, and through committed actions will we achieve ""Never Again.""","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanBradSchneider/photos/a.402055743210765.94438.401029529980053/1343974742352189/?type=3",NA,65,2,15,6,0,0,8,0

Thanksgiving is also a time to recognize the work of the women and men proudly serving our nation and communities doing work that will keep them away from their families this holiday. So let us all keep in our thanksgiving prayers the service members serving far and near, the first responders on duty long into the night, the medical professionals on holiday rounds, and all those others who keep us safe and secure.
