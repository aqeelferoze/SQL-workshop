Judge Gorsuch’s decisions have gone directly against the rights of women both in their careers and in their personal lives. In the Hobby Lobby case, he joined the majority in stripping reproductive rights from women in the workplace. By continuously supporting defunding Planned Parenthood, millions of women are left without essential healthcare services to detect breast cancer, cervical cancer and other special medical screenings vital to women.  Judge Gorsuch has consistently voted against consumers, including in Strickland vs. UPS, where he dissented to a ruling giving a female UPS driver a chance to prove sex discrimination. Just last year, Judge Gorsuch ruled against a consumer who was wrongly charged hundreds of dollars in Elizabeth Hammond vs. Stamps.com, making it easier for companies to move their case to federal court, a move that favors big businesses and harms consumers.  He has embraced a radical legal doctrine that would allow the courts to overrule agency experts implementing regulations to protect the American people. These laws would allow judges to overrule essential protections for Americans put in place by agencies involving the environment, essential workers’ rights and safeguards for consumers.  If approved by the Senate, Judge Gorsuch’s decisions will affect the American people for decades to come. His record is far outside the judicial mainstream and the American people deserve better than a far right wing, activist judge that has a record of choosing the most powerful interests over those of extraordinary, ordinary Americans.","status",NA,NA,374,80,27,35,0,1,5,2

The questions continue to mount about Russia’s role in our national elections, who met with whom, if there was any collusion on the part of the Trump campaign with the Russians, and why the President consistently defends Vladimir Putin. This is why a bipartisan independent commission should be established to get the facts and pursue the truth. The American people deserve to know who did what and the extent of the damage to our democracy.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-spoke-twice-with-russian-ambassador-during-trumps-presidential-campaign-justice-officials-say/2017/03/01/77205eda-feac-11e6-99b4-9e613afeb09f_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_sessions-920pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.45c42217983d","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-spoke-twice-with-russian-ambassador-during-trumps-presidential-campaign-justice-officials-say/2017/03/01/77205eda-feac-11e6-99b4-9e613afeb09f_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_sessions-920pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.45c42217983d","washingtonpost.com",60,22,15,0,0,1,1,26

It is even more troubling that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said he would recuse himself from this investigation, played a direct role in Director Comey’s termination.  The President fired Sally Yates, then he fired Preet Bharara, and now he has fired Director Comey, all people who were investigating the President. This is not a coincidence.  I called for a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate the President and his ties to Russia long before his Administration began.

After the dead-of-night changes by Republicans, the legislation provides less coverage for higher costs, with 23 million Americans projected to lose their health insurance. Essential health benefits will be eviscerated for millions of Americans, creating huge cost increases for basic coverage such as maternity care, addiction and mental health treatment, and emergency services. The bill also strips away Medicaid from millions of low-income families and children, and imposes a crushing age tax on older Americans.  Republican and Democratic Senators alike have said Trumpcare is dead on arrival in the upper chamber.

In a hand-written prayer he wrote on D-Day, President Roosevelt prayed that Americans can ""prevail over the unholy forces of our enemy... and conquer the apostles of greed and racial arrogancies.""

Instead, he merely outlined the basic goals past presidents have supported -- stability and security to the region and ensuring the country will not be a safe-haven for terrorists. The war in Afghanistan is the longest engagement in U.S. history, with more than 2,400 American lives lost and billions of taxpayer dollars spent. The President further doubled down on this open-ended conflict by refusing to say how many additional troops he plans to put in harm’s way or giving a timeline for withdrawal.  By failing to even mention the word ‘Congress’ in his speech, the President believes he can move forward with a blank check for Afghanistan without Congress passing a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF). We owe it to the thousands of servicemembers still fighting in Afghanistan to have this debate sixteen years after Congress first authorized military operations in Afghanistan after the September 11th attacks.  http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-President-Trump-needs-a-vision-for-11951150.php","link","http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-President-Trump-needs-a-vision-for-11951150.php","sfchronicle.com",66,21,8,0,0,0,10,2

Over 787,000 individuals have received relief from deportation under the DACA program, allowing them to obtain work permits, pursue higher education, obtain driver’s licenses, and contribute their talents to our nation.

It will increase the output of carbon pollution in the air and do nothing to help the coal miners the President vowed to defend. The Clean Power Plan is a job creation plan, an economic policy and a climate policy. It represents a critical step to protecting our planet for our children and grandchildren, and without it, the U.S. cannot reach the goals established by the Paris Accords.  Even without the plan fully in effect, states like my home state of California are already moving ahead of the targets established by the Clean Power Plan, but federal help is crucial. These are not tangled senseless regulations. They are safety measures to protect the health of our people, our country and the planet.   https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/opinion/trump-coal-climate-emissions.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fopinion&action=click&contentCollection=opinion&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=sectionfront","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/opinion/trump-coal-climate-emissions.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fopinion&action=click&contentCollection=opinion&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=sectionfront","nytimes.com",43,15,33,1,0,4,14,67
