Most troubling is her lack of understanding, and her refusal to commit to enforcing disability protections for all children. My sister had a disability, and my mother fought to ensure she could benefit from a public education. Children with special needs have incredible potential to pursue careers of their choice and lead meaningful lives. To unilaterally determine that any child doesn’t deserve to succeed is shameful. We can’t allow this ignorance of our federal civil rights, which seems to be a common characteristic among the incoming President’s top picks to run the federal government. https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/senators-to-scrutinize-betsy-devos-trumps-pick-for-education-secretary/2017/01/17/3a0e6168-da8f-11e6-9a36-1d296534b31e_story.html?utm_term=.ea84058da5bd","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/senators-to-scrutinize-betsy-devos-trumps-pick-for-education-secretary/2017/01/17/3a0e6168-da8f-11e6-9a36-1d296534b31e_story.html?utm_term=.ea84058da5bd","washingtonpost.com",963,166,289,17,3,17,77,250

He failed to recognize the magnitude of this moment and he missed the opportunity to unify a divided country.  We all have an obligation to work together to ensure everyone has the opportunity to find good jobs, get access to quality, affordable health care, and feel safe in their communities.  Instead, the President reiterated an isolationist philosophy that goes against America’s core values. He continues to play to people’s worst fears, and in doing so, he jeopardizes America’s standing in the world.  Nevertheless, I am prepared to work with the President and his team, and help them understand the challenges we face in New Mexico. We have critical federal infrastructure in the state and a proud workforce that helps to keep America safe and prosperous. We also have a diverse population that values all of our neighbors, including immigrants.  I am always hopeful for the future of New Mexico, and I will do everything in my power to ensure our state is always represented in Washington. http://www.npr.org/2017/01/20/510746700/donald-trump-sworn-in-as-the-45th-president-of-the-united-states","link","http://www.npr.org/2017/01/20/510746700/donald-trump-sworn-in-as-the-45th-president-of-the-united-states","npr.org",257,65,27,21,1,5,4,21

Under the Republican plan, health care will be more difficult to find, impossible to afford, and the relationship between health care providers and patients will no longer exist. That’s why the American Medical Association, doctors, hospitals and the AARP are so opposed to this plan.  If that wasn’t bad enough, Republicans are making sure the health care insurance industry and prescription drug companies will benefit nicely from $600 billion in tax cuts. This is an outrageous abdication of responsibility. Special interests make out like bandits, while working families across the nation lose access to life-saving care and face the prospect of financial ruin.  The impact of lost Medicaid funding will be a disaster in New Mexico, where more than 900,000 people rely on Medicaid for their health care. Thousands of New Mexicans, including the poorest and sickest people, will return to Emergency Rooms for basic care, costing taxpayers more money and doing nothing to actually treat chronic illnesses.  And on top of the looming health care disaster, this Republican plan will crush New Mexico’s already struggling economy. It will decimate rural providers and hospitals, and pull funding from any hope to rebuild a behavioral health or substance abuse system. Private-sector job growth, currently boosted by Medicaid expansion, will reverse, and we will have little to offer new businesses we want to relocate here.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepLujanGrisham/photos/a.197071373769723.61564.191640657646128/1039255076218011/?type=3",NA,39,25,20,0,1,0,17,50

Their vigorous fight for equality, their technological innovations that have transformed the world and the female world leaders who incite infinite hope provide powerful messages that will transcend generations. I am proud and humbled to follow in the footsteps of so many inspirational women, like Jeannette Rankin of Montana, who was the first U.S. Congresswoman, Maud Wood Park who was the first president of the League of Women Voters, and Mary McLeod Bethune who raised money to pay for poll taxes for over a hundred female voters in Florida.

At the same time, President Trump wants to cut $1.4 trillion from Medicaid, which provides critical health care services for 900,000 New Mexicans. We already know the Republican health care plan would result in an $11 billion economic hit to New Mexico, while eliminating 31,000 jobs. Additional Medicaid cuts outlined in today’s budget plan would further cripple New Mexico’s economy.   Trump’s budget wastes billions of dollars on a costly and ineffective border wall and deportation force, while calling for radical cuts to nutrition assistance, public education and medical research.

Many Americans would see no substantial tax relief and their children and grandchildren will shoulder the burden of paying off the debt for years to come. Moreover, the Republican plan will further raise health care costs by eliminating the medical expense deduction.  If Republicans want real tax reform, they should work with Democrats to focus on tax changes that grow the economy, create jobs and focus tax relief on middle-class families, especially in states like New Mexico that have not recovered from the recession and financial crisis.  We should be doing more to create a clean energy economy and build a green energy workforce; support small and medium-sized businesses that drive job creation; and make college and child care more affordable.    The economic growth that our country has seen since the recession has not been shared equally and all this tax plan will do is widen that gap.  Let's work together on bi-partisan tax reform that will expand economic opportunity and benefit all Americans-not just the wealthy few.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/02/winners-and-losers-in-the-gop-tax-plan/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-high_tax-winnerslosers-230pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.eb70213981d0","washingtonpost.com",63,35,35,1,1,1,11,52

CHIP is a critical safety net and provides more than 15,000 New Mexico children with high quality, comprehensive health care coverage.

The Forest Service is currently underfunded and forced to borrow from non-fire accounts to put out fires.  This hinders its ability to conduct the routine maintenance and thinning that New Mexico’s forests require. Unfortunately, instead of solving the fire borrowing issue, this bill makes it worse by adding needless bureaucracy to combatting emergency wildfires.  I supported an amendment to fix this problem using the fire fix language from the bipartisan Simpson-Schrader bill. But Republican leadership refused to allow a vote on the amendment.","status",NA,NA,126,15,13,2,1,2,14,8

As we have seen in Kansas, trickle-down economics is a nightmare and will only lead to crisis and decline. This tax plan not only provides massive tax cuts to the rich on the backs of hard-working New Mexicans but undermines important job-creating investments in the New Mexico economy. Further, the $1.7 trillion package that will have to be paid for by our children and grandchildren will force automatic budget cuts that will decimate Medicare, workforce training services, investments that grow small businesses, and agriculture programs that New Mexico’s economy depends on.   It’s insulting that under this plan college students will face more debt; teachers will be penalized for buying school supplies; planned renewable energy investments in New Mexico will be in jeopardy, and middle-class families will pay more for medical expenses and long-term care.  I call for bi-partisan tax reform that truly invests in the middle-class, simplifies the tax code, facilitates job creation and economic growth, and ensures the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share. I introduced an amendment to the tax package that was based on my legislation to tax opioid producers and manufacturers and create a permanent source of funding for opioid treatment, prevention, and research. Republican leadership refused to allow a vote on the amendment.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/house-poised-to-pass-its-tax-bill-as-senate-plan-suffers-setbacks/2017/11/16/62d92fa4-cad7-11e7-8321-481fd63f174d_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_taxreform-1157am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.4670d06eaead","washingtonpost.com",227,70,34,10,1,4,25,47
