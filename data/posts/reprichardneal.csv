The unanimous assessment of the CIA, the FBI, and the National Security Agency is that Vladimir Putin personally hoped to undermine public faith in the democratic process through a highly sophisticated campaign of cyber-attacks and espionage. And in the process, help discredit and denigrate Hillary Clinton and significantly improve the chances of Donald Trump.   I strongly agree with Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, that public trust in the professionalism of America’s intelligence agencies is essential. Disparaging their credibility is something Democrats and Republicans take very seriously. But in numerous tweets, President-elect Trump continues to be skeptical of their findings, and has recently expressed more support for the national security views of  controversial WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. With the publication of yesterday’s U.S. intelligence report, however, any doubts about the Kremlin’s involvement in the 2016 election should be put to rest.   This week, I joined more than 170 of my colleagues in the House of Representatives calling for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate foreign interference in the 2016 election. In my opinion, it is time to put politics aside, find out how this extraordinary security breach with Russia occurred, and hold those responsible accountable. We simply cannot let our democratic institutions to be compromised again.","status",NA,NA,269,69,44,9,0,1,1,12

For seven years, Republicans have railed against the Affordable Care Act but have failed to even agree on a single plan to adequately replace this landmark law. Despite Republican rhetoric, the facts are clear: this repeal plan would take away health insurance from nearly 30 million men, women, and children in this country. This job-killing proposal would hurt local hospitals and have a devastating economic impact on communities across the country. It would put insurance companies back in control of Americans’ health care by cutting consumer protections. And it would enable insurers to deny people coverage simply because they have pre-existing conditions like asthma or diabetes. This couldn’t get any farther from the ‘Better Way’ that Republicans promised for the American people. Democrats are united in our efforts to protect the progress we have achieved under the ACA.","status",NA,NA,164,45,33,1,1,1,10,19

Even more disturbing is today’s disclosure  that the Justice Department warned the White House about General Flynn’s possibly illegal behavior and nothing was done about it. I believe the American people need to know the full extent of the relationship between the Trump administration and the Russian government. And President Trump must finally release his tax returns so the public can learn whether he has any financial or business interest with Russia. After the Kremlin put the integrity of our electoral system at risk with their cyber-attacks, I called for an independent and bipartisan investigation into their involvement in the 2016 election. That act was nothing less than a direct assault on our democracy by a foreign government. Following General Flynn’s resignation, the probe should now be expanded to include the Trump administration’s ties with Vladimir Putin and Russia.

The American people want health care that is affordable and available when they need it, but the Republican repeal bill would charge them more money for less care. It would dramatically drive up health care costs for seniors. And repeal would ration care for more than 70 million Americans, including seniors in nursing homes, pregnant women and children living with disabilities by arbitrarily cutting and capping Medicaid. The Republican repeal bill would not protect patients, save money, or help working families; it is nothing but a drastic and devastating step backward.  The Republican repeal bill was drafted in secret, and introduced less than two days before our committees are scheduled to mark it up. This action makes a mockery of Speaker Ryan’s claims that ‘we’re not hatching some bill in the backroom and plopping it on the American people’s front door.’ It also stands in stark contrast to the transparent and deliberate process Democrats followed when the Affordable Care Act was introduced and moved through our committees. It’s disgraceful that there was no transparency in this process, and that the American people are not being given time to read and comment on a bill that significantly affects their health security.","status",NA,NA,92,35,29,5,0,0,2,17

Since 1995, and the appointment of former Senator George Mitchell, there have been approximately six individuals, chosen by three presidents, who have served in this meaningful diplomatic post in a bipartisan manner.   On both sides of the Atlantic, there is little debate that each special envoy has played an indispensable role in the negotiation and implementation of several peace accords, and have helped to strengthen ties between the United States and Ireland. These men and women have been honest brokers whose appointments have signaled continued American interest in the region and ongoing support for the peace process.   We are now entering a critically important period of U.S.- Ireland relations, with a wide range of important issues to be addressed,  so I strongly urge President Trump to appoint a new special envoy at the earliest possible opportunity.

Despite warnings from independent experts like CBO and others, Republicans continue to recklessly jam this bill through Congress without so much as a single hearing on what effects their plan will have on middle-class families. This report also reaffirms that the Republican plan does absolutely nothing to control costs or protect consumers. Instead, it guts Medicaid, raises costs on older Americans, and pulls billions of dollars from Medicare, all in order to pay for tax cuts for the rich.  This is a major step backwards for millions of Americans who now enjoy the benefits and protections of quality health insurance gained under the Affordable Care Act.

For seven years, Democrats have said that if Republicans removed the threat of repeal, we would gladly work with them on ways to improve coverage, lower costs, and strengthen consumer protections. That offer still stands to any Republican who puts aside their insistence on repealing the Affordable Care Act.  I hope that as Congress begins consideration of the budget, tax reform, and other important legislation, Speaker Ryan and House Republicans will reconsider their ‘go it alone’ governing strategy and work with Democrats to find consensus on the big issues we face.

This ideological wish list of deep cuts would do nothing but wreak havoc on the lives of middle-class and working families across our country. Instead of a plan that lifts up the middle class and invests in programs to create a competitive 21st century economy, this budget does the exact opposite. This irresponsible budget will further exacerbate the opioid epidemic that’s torn apart families in cities and towns across this country and stretched the already thin resources in local communities. Drastic cuts to middle-class programs like Medicaid will force working families to choose between sending their children to school and caring for aging parents. And despite repeated promises not to touch Social Security, this budget cuts Social Security benefits, damaging a key lifeline for millions of Americans unable to work. This is a budget designed to inflict pain on the very people that make up the backbone of this country.","status",NA,NA,125,47,37,4,1,5,6,41

Republicans feared this CBO score so much that they rushed to vote for this bill three weeks ago without even having estimates of how many millions of Americans they would be ripping away health insurance from or how much the bill would cost the middle class and working families. This reckless and irresponsible behavior is not how we should be making policy here in Congress. It’s time for Republicans to finally wake up and realize the basic fact that undermining our nation’s health care system, imposing an age tax on seniors, and eliminating protections for those with pre-existing conditions will not improve health outcomes in this country. Instead, Republicans should work with Democrats to strengthen the system by building on the successes we have seen thanks to the Affordable Care Act.

The American people put a magnifying glass on this bill for what it was truly about: a healthcare reform bill that was about cutting taxes for those at the top. This bill would cut $760 billion from Medicaid, which has become a middle-class benefit, as well as force 22 million Americans lose their healthcare coverage. It’s a bad deal for Massachusetts and the nation. Republicans need to come to the table and talk to Democrats about how to improve care and lower costs, not kick working families off of insurance.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/reprichardneal/photos/a.325829677447229.94581.325642654132598/1724664884230361/?type=3",NA,131,32,11,6,1,0,0,0

Rural communities face particular challenges in organizing and delivering high quality care. One of the little-known benefits of the Affordable Care Act has been new funding and initiatives to improve care coordination and better align incentives to promote high quality health care. While in Massachusetts strides have been made to work with providers like hospitals and physicians to deliver better care to our rural areas, there is still a clear need to bridge the divide between access and care. This grant provides critical funds to Fairview Hospital to develop efficient, forward thinking health delivery strategies in a collaborative manner. Not only that, but also an opportunity to measure strategy outcomes and so there is a base on which to build future programs.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/reprichardneal/photos/a.325829677447229.94581.325642654132598/1736055039758012/?type=3",NA,61,5,6,4,0,0,0,0

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, between 2006 and 2015, the number of individuals addicted to heroin nationwide jumped from 227,000 to 591,000 and prescription opioid addiction increased from 1.5 million to 2 million. In addition, opioid deaths nationwide have nearly tripled from 2002 to 2015. These numbers are staggering. Right here in Massachusetts, the opioid death rate is 17.0 per 100,000. Without action, these trends will continue their dangerous trajectory.  The Affordable Care Act includes at least $45 billion for opioid addiction treatment and that would be lost if the measure was repealed. In Massachusetts alone, it is projected to cost $123 million to provide comprehensive coverage for all people treated for opioid use disorders in Massachusetts in 2026. An estimated 2.8 million people with substance use disorders, including those with an opioid disorder, could lose some or all of their coverage if the ACA’s Medicaid expansion is phased out.  Over the past few years I have worked with my colleagues on important pieces of legislation such as the STOP Act and the Opioid Overdose Reduction Act to address the opioid addiction crisis. The STOP Act or the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act would enhance the U.S. Postal Service’s process of tracking shipments from foreign countries to detect synthetic drugs such as fentanyl and carfentanil. This would help curb these drugs from crossing our borders into the United States in the first place. The Opioid Overdose Reduction Act, a Good Samaritan-like bill, would exempt from civil liability individuals who provide or administer an opioid overdose drug under certain circumstances.   In addition, I hosted President Obama's drug czar Michael Botticelli to brief the Massachusetts delegation about the crisis and how we could help. I also hosted the producer of the HBO Documentary ‘Heroin: Cape Cod, USA’ to multiple screenings across the First Congressional District and also to a screening and discussion with my Congressional colleagues in Washington.   The time to take action against opioid abuse is now. I commend President Trump for taking this matter so seriously and look forward to working with him and my Congressional colleagues to address this critical public health and safety issue.","status",NA,NA,38,6,4,0,0,0,0,0

More than 2,400 men and women of our Armed Services have lost their lives and thousands more have been wounded in what many regard as an endless cycle of military intervention. And tonight, the President announced his intention to put more American boots on the ground with no clearly defined mission.   I do not minimize the threat posed by the Taliban, ISIS or Al Qaeda in the region and across the world. The tragic events last week in Barcelona are a stark reminder that we need to remain vigilant in the global war on terror.

The President said today he wants to unrig the economy, which begs the question: unrig it for who? If President Trump’s previous tax plans are any indication, the wealthy and big corporations will be the ultimate winner at the expense of the middle class. I think this is the wrong approach. Giving huge tax cuts to businesses in the hopes that wealth will magically trickle down to hardworking Americans is pure folly, and not supported by the facts. Middle-class families have heard enough empty promises and rhetoric from Republicans. Democrats believe that now is the time to act on comprehensive tax reform. We stand ready to work in good faith with Republicans on real tax reform that provides tax relief and expands opportunities for middle-class families, closes the skills gap, and promotes middle-class job growth.","status",NA,NA,179,74,30,5,1,1,2,10

Let me refresh everyone’s memories on the facts here.  Until recently, every President since Gerald Ford released their tax returns to the American public.  President Gerald Ford released a summary of his tax returns. President Jimmy Carter. President Ronald Reagan. President George H.W. Bush. President Bill Clinton. President George W. Bush. President Barack Obama.  Republican and Democratic Presidents. They all released their tax returns to the American people.  This is not a partisan issue. The reason for releasing this information is to avoid conflicts of interest. Tax returns include important information about income and charitable giving and business interests, among other things. And this information is important for the American people to have so they know that their President is always acting in their best interest.  Therefore, I support my friend Mr. Pascrell’s resolution.

If President Trump and Congressional Republicans truly want to have tax reform that benefits the middle class, as they have said, then they shouldn’t be so fearful in releasing more specifics. It is discouraging that Republicans have yet to include Democrats in meaningful discussions on tax reform. I believe, however, that there is still time for actual bipartisanship in this process and I’m hopeful Republicans will include Democrats – expanding their so-called “Big Six” to a “Big Ten” – so that we can work together to provide tax relief for our middle class, invest in community colleges and infrastructure, and close loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and big corporations.","status",NA,NA,78,27,12,3,0,1,0,1

This is yet another attempt to kill the Affordable Care Act that has benefitted Massachusetts and the rest of the US. What is deeply troubling, and less often focused on, is how this latest Republican effort would set back attempts to combat the opioid epidemic across the country. In Massachusetts alone, residents have seen a dramatic uptick in opioid-related overdose deaths from 2000-2016, spiking from 379 deaths in 2000 to 2,107 deaths in 2016. The four western counties of Massachusetts have been hit particularly hard.   Without access to treatment and recovery resources provided in the ACA, these numbers will surely continue their dangerous climb. People struggling with addiction can’t afford to have their insurance coverage taken away. Now is a time for us to come together and strengthen programs to fight addiction, not dismantle them.

It’s time for Republicans to stop playing games with Americans’ health care, and work with Democrats in a bipartisan manner through hearings and legislation that will stabilize markets, protect Medicaid from drastic cuts, and actually help ensure positive health outcomes for American families.","status",NA,NA,61,41,19,2,0,3,2,10

After more than a year of work, Republicans have only managed to produce a nine-page document without any of the significant details the American people deserve to know. In our meeting yesterday at the White House with Ways and Means Committee members, President Trump promised that under his tax plan, ‘the rich will not benefit.’ It’s clear that only a day later, Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell have already broken that promise. Why should the American people believe anything House and Senate Republicans say about their tax plan when they don’t even come close to meeting any of President Trump’s stated goals about tax reform? This tax plan would give big tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, helping the rich get richer while leaving behind working families and middle-class Americans. Not only that, their plan would also explode our nation’s deficit by believing that tax cuts pay for themselves – something that respected economists on both sides of the aisle know is simply not true or borne out by any facts.   This has been a partisan process from the start with virtually no Democratic input, as Republicans have put politics above policy and the economic security of hardworking Americans. I have long said that real tax reform needs to be done in a bipartisan manner because as we learned from 1986, that’s the only way we’ll be successful. Today, Republicans instead chose to continue down their own path without even knowing where it will lead.   Democrats are united in our effort to stand up for the middle class rather than those at the top, and we will fight every day to make sure hardworking middle-class families get the tax relief they need. We are determined to make smart investments in job creation programs and community colleges, make child care and education more affordable, and strengthen retirement security for all Americans.","status",NA,NA,145,45,41,1,1,2,11,30

Those in need of dialysis are in dire condition due to Puerto Rico’s lack of needed fuel and supplies to dialyze those with kidney disease. More than a week after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, needed medical supplies and fuel have not been delivered, resulting in the death of kidney patients; these deaths were preventable and the failure to get needed help to the island is inexcusable. The Administration and Congress must act immediately to get urgently needed fuel and supplies to Puerto Rico. HHS and FEMA must act with immediacy.

The American people deserve a tax code founded on fairness.  Our tax system should reward hardworking, middle-class families, small businesses, and innovators, while ensuring that no one, no matter how well-connected or wealthy they are, can avoid paying their fair share.

This is simply a bad idea. America is in a crisis. Few people save enough to live comfortably for the years after they stop working. One vehicle for saving for retirement that people do use is their 401(k) plan. Reports on the GOP tax reform proposal, however, indicate that there would be a cap as to how much money individuals are able to contribute to their plan on a pre-tax basis. This cap scheme would harm Americans’ ability to prepare for retirement by providing less of an incentive to save and decreasing small business’ incentive to sponsor retirement plans. Taxing workers retirement savings now with a promise of tax savings in 40 years only worsens our nation’s retirement crisis. The Republicans are phasing out savings to pay for a tax cut for the people at the top. Democrats are trying to make it easier for people to plan for their future.","status",NA,NA,74,35,21,1,0,8,2,33

This Republican tax bill is no different. A rushed, partisan and secret process yielded over 400 pages of broken promises to middle-class families. This bill falls short of reform, falls short of middle-class tax relief and falls short of the fiscal principles to which Republicans have long held themselves.   Months of secret negotiations have produced a plan that tilts the tax code farther from the middle-class and more towards the well-off and well-connected. Their plan slashes taxes for big corporations and those at the top by gutting important deductions and tax incentives that every middle-class family in America relies on. Republicans have raided the very deductions and credits that help millions of families afford everything from groceries to medical expenses to a college education, just to give more those who don’t need it and haven’t asked for it. For generations, the American dream was built on the promise that if you worked hard and played by the rules you could buy a home, raise a family and save for a secure retirement. Republicans have rolled out a bill today that makes homeownership more expensive, education more costly and needed medical care unaffordable.   Republicans had every opportunity to work with Democrats on a bipartisan plan that would have provided real reform for real people. Instead, they chose a path of secrecy and partisanship that excluded Democrats and many of their own members. Democrats will work in the coming weeks to expose the true cost this bill will have on middle-class families, small businesses and innovators. http://bit.ly/2h70UO2","link","http://bit.ly/2h70UO2","bit.ly",132,71,33,1,0,1,14,31

As Democrats repeatedly pointed out this week, corporations will keep many of the same benefits middle-class families are losing.    Democrats offered dozens of amendments to make this legislation less disastrous for middle-class families. Though Republicans praised many of these measures’ merits, they still opposed each and every one.    From the beginning of this process, I sought open, bipartisan debate to achieve real reform for real people. Instead, Republicans crafted a bill behind closed doors, without a single hearing, and then substantially changed the measure twice while it was under committee consideration this week. After such a secretive, rushed process, it’s no surprise that the resulting legislation is a bad deal that raises taxes on millions of middle-class workers to finance massive cuts for those at the top.   We will continue to fight this middle-class tax hike when it reaches the House floor. Democrats want to expand opportunity for Americans so that they can afford to cover their medical expenses, buy a home, pursue an education, and retire comfortably. We are committed to a fairer path forward that prioritizes the middle class and invigorates our economy.","status",NA,NA,107,58,42,1,0,1,16,47

Today, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) provided fresh evidence that even under the most generously optimistic economic conditions, tax cuts do not pay for themselves. The Republicans’ bill will add at least $1 trillion to the deficit at the expense of the next generation. Middle class families, seniors, and our children will ultimately finance these proposed cuts for corporations and those at the top. In addition to the startling analysis by the JCT, CEOs have been warning publicly that they plan to use corporate tax cuts to reward wealthy shareholders, not increase workers’ salaries. At best, the Republican tax plan will do nothing for working families. At worst, it will hike taxes, increase healthcare costs, and cut important services for families who are working hard and playing by the rules.

They chose policies that support working families, grow the economy, strengthen our healthcare system and lift up those aspiring to reach the middle-class over policies that reward the well-off and well-connected and further rig the system against American families. Alabamans deserve to have the representative they chose, not a political appointee, in place to vote on their behalf, particularly on a matter as critical as a tax bill that will affect every family, small business and worker in this country.    This situation is not unprecedented. In 2010, during debate on the Affordable Care Act, my home state of Massachusetts elected Scott Brown in a special election to succeed Sen Ted Kennedy. Following that election, Democrats delayed final action on the ACA until Senator Brown could be seated. Quite simply, we did the right thing even when it wasn't in our best political interests. And, let us not forget the sham of an argument that was made by Senator McConnell when he, for more than a year, left a seat on the United States Supreme Court empty, stating simply that we should wait on the outcome of the presidential election to ensure that we were respecting the will of the American people. Senator McConnell doesn’t get to have it both ways. Just as Senator McConnell wanted to respect the will of voters in  Massachusetts in 2010 and the will of the American people in 2016, he must now respect the will of the voters in Alabama and stop consideration of the Republican tax bill until Senator-elect Jones is seated.","status",NA,NA,224,58,14,22,6,0,1,1

This move undermines and reverses consumer protective regulations already in place that allow for a level playing field in the e-commerce marketplace. I have heard from constituents across the First Congressional District of Massachusetts and the overwhelming majority of them are worried about what this will do to the guarantee of an open, free Internet. Today’s dangerous rules have potential to drown consumers with higher costs and less choice. This is detrimental to our entrepreneurs and small businesses who are trying to succeed. I fully intend to support Representative Mike Doyle’s resolution to overturn today’s decision using the authority in the Congressional Review Act.","status",NA,NA,289,88,29,6,5,2,16,56

One can only assume they were being this secretive because the bill raises taxes on millions of middle-class families while cutting corporations’ taxes, explodes the deficit by roughly $2 trillion, strips health insurance from millions of Americans, and prompts billions of dollars of cuts to Medicare.   The GOP have seemed to accomplish the impossible. They developed tax cut legislation that has been rejected by two-thirds of the American people because the public sees this for what it is – a giveaway to the well-off and well-connected that the middle class will be forced to foot the bill for down the road.","status",NA,NA,48,54,24,1,0,2,10,79

Our children and grandchildren will be forced to foot the bill for tax cuts given to those at the very top and big corporations. This legislation will have long-term, wide-ranging negative impacts on Americans’ economic security.    With this harmful bill, Republicans are just getting started. Speaker Ryan plans to fund these regressive cuts by slashing benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security that Americans have earned through years of hard work. Democrats will fight to protect these programs, and we’ll do everything we can to lower families’ premiums in the face of President Trump’s attacks on healthcare.    This tax legislation was a missed opportunity to achieve meaningful, positive change for middle class families. But despite this setback, Democrats will continue to put the middle class first and work to create a more secure and prosperous future for generations to come.","status",NA,NA,84,131,44,0,11,5,36,117
