I cannot understand how anyone could justify voting for this measure. The Office of Congressional Ethics is currently an independent, non-partisan entity. The office has, historically, been able to investigate wrongdoing by Members of Congress, including anonymous reports by whistleblowers. By stripping this office of its power and instead transferring oversight to the House Ethics Committee – into the very hands of those who could be subject to such investigations – House Republicans have betrayed the trust of their constituents.  This is a disheartening start to the new Congress, to say the very least, and I condemn this move in the strongest terms possible. This is a time of uncertainty for so many in this country, and reducing accountability and transparency, effectively giving Members of Congress a free pass, does nothing to alleviate the very real concerns of those questioning who and what their elected leaders truly represent.","status",NA,NA,98,29,16,6,0,1,1,9

He directed his most recent tirade at a civil rights hero, legend, statesman, and true public servant, my colleague, Congressman John Lewis. It has been an honor to work alongside Congressman Lewis, and I both understand and support his reasons for boycotting the inauguration. Quite the contrary to the President-elect’s recent statements, Congressman Lewis is a man of both action and principle.  While I take great umbrage at the policies and positions of the President-elect, I have the greatest respect for the office. I hope that Mr. Trump will feel the awesome responsibility of the mantle placed upon him on Friday and will cease his irresponsible, dangerous, and insulting behavior. When I attend the inauguration, I will do so to remind him that the communities that he so frequently and flippantly attacks are watching. I will attend as someone with a disability who refuses to normalize the President-elect’s behavior. I will attend as someone representing so many constituents who are afraid of what this presidency will bring.

His EO fails to ensure the continuity of health coverage for the millions of Americans who depend on the benefits and services provided by the ACA. Under the guise of regulatory flexibility, the EO may reduce the enforcement of key ACA provisions, a move that could cause widespread uncertainty in the individual insurance market and harm the American people.

She is, quite simply, unqualified for the job, with no real education experience and very little understanding of the complex and critical issues facing the department she hopes to lead. While I did not have a role in the confirmation process, I am deeply disappointed that, in an unprecedented move, the Vice President had to step in to break a tie and confirm this nominee. I have received many phone calls, emails and social media feedback from constituents – many of whom work in education – who are overwhelmingly opposed to Secretary DeVos.
