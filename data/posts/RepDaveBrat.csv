But financial institutions were ignoring all common sense and loaning money to anyone with a pulse, even if they did not offer a single shred of evidence that they could afford the loan. These were the now infamous ""no doc"" loans.  These terrible lending practices were being caused by liberal big government policies.  Federal mortgage standards were being set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, under the direction of key Democrats in Congress, and these mortgage buying giants were constantly lowering the underwriting standards for making loans.  The corruption embedded in these government entities was captured in several books on their CEOs who make even us politicians blush. Corruption it turns out is a human trait, not a free market invention.  In fact, former President George W. Bush and other Republicans were calling on Congress to reform these lending standards because of the risk they created starting in 2001. Those warnings were ignored by congressional leaders like Rep.

The false claims and broken promises used to promote Obamacare to the American people have real consequences for families, businesses, the economy, and the Federal budget.   Those most affected by Obamacare’s broken promises – individuals and families – struggle not only with rising costs of coverage and dwindling health care choices, but also Washington-directed mandates and penalties. A recent report showed that 50 percent of “Obamacare” customers were cutting back on care to help manage their health costs. In other words, coverage does not equal care.  Employers struggle with the rising cost of providing coverage to maintain a healthy workforce. The New York Fed reported, for example, that 21 percent of businesses in the region reduced the number of employees, wages, and benefits as a result of the law. Additionally, the number one small business problem is the “cost of health insurance.”  Federal spending on health care continues to outpace and crowd out other policy priorities, such as defense, education, infrastructure, and so on. In 2015, spending on Federal health care programs totaled $936 billion – exceeding Social Security outlays for the first time. While Federal health spending has seen a recent decline due to the slowdown in the economy, spending continues to grow faster than inflation, an unsustainable trend.  What’s Next? Obamacare simply has not worked. Instead, it has harmed millions of individuals and families across the Nation. It is time to move forward with patient-centered reforms to achieve lower costs, greater access, and more coverage choices for all Americans. The House Budget Committee, of which I am a member, will hold a hearing on the harmful effects of Obamacare on Tuesday, January 24th.

The lawmakers on Capitol Hill were sent by the American people to represent their interests. Members of Congress have a right — indeed, a duty — to claim their stake in decisions on when men and women in uniform will be sent into harm’s way to defend the American people and our national-security interests.   The president is the commander-in-chief, according to the Constitution, but it is the Congress that has the power to determine when the country should go to war. For more than a decade, Congress has passed the buck on this responsibility. Meanwhile, America’s uniformed men and women have been put into dangerous situations in Iraq and Syria on the barest of legal rationales — an authorization for the use of force that was passed a week after the September 11 attacks, over 15 years ago, when the Islamic State wasn’t even in existence. If Congress trusts Mattis to do the right thing on behalf of the U.S. military and agrees with much of what the general says, it should be mindful that it is what the military professional with 41 years’ experience maintains it should be: a legislative branch that follows the war-making direction outlined in Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution.""","link","http://www.nationalreview.com/article/444147/james-mattis-congress-constitution-warmaking-direction-powers-authorization-use-military-force","nationalreview.com",34,13,0,1,0,0,0,4

Dave Brat (R-Va.) made the following statement after House Leadership pulled from the floor of the House of Representatives the American Health Care Act.  ""Over the past few days, I joined with conservative colleagues in the House to negotiate in good faith and find common ground with President Trump and White House staff. Those discussions with the President were positive, constructive, and moved the legislation in the right direction. However, the initial construction of this bill kept the structure and architecture of Obamacare fully in place. Even my Democrat colleagues agreed this failed bill left much of Obamacare in place.  For the good of our country, I want to see President Trump and his agenda succeed. With more time for deliberation, I believe we could have, and still can, get conservative health care reform that lowers costs and increases choice over the finish line. Productive solutions were well underway and could have been reached with a few more weeks of hard study and compromise – they may have even attracted some Democrats to the bill.  My promise to my constituents remains the same: I will always follow my principles, work towards good policy, and listen to my constituents. That remains the case with my commitment to repeal Obamacare and find solutions to drive the cost of healthcare down. Health care is one-sixth of our economy and it is too big of an issue to rush through. On Friday, President Trump said Obamacare will fall apart and then we will be there with solution and an even better bill. I look forward to seeing his ideas and finding unity in our party so we can all work to accomplish real repeal.”","link","http://brat.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=361","brat.house.gov",243,242,50,23,4,0,1,32

United States Senator Mike Lee and Senator Booker introduced companion legislation in the Senate.  Participation in these USDA checkoff programs is mandatory yet the management of checkoff dollars lacks transparency and accountability. The boards have faced well-documented criticism for conflicts of interest, anti-competitive market activity, and unlawful policy advocacy coordination.  Poor oversight and unclear federal transparency requirements has led to questionable behavior and cozy relationships between checkoff boards and lobbyist organizations. This bill will shed sunlight on these boards and ensure producers can rest knowing their checkoff funds are not being used to advance select special interests and anti-competitive practices that hurt free markets.","link","https://www.forbes.com/sites/nancyhuehnergarth/2016/07/14/senators-booker-and-lee-introduce-bill-to-halt-anticompetitive-activities-of-usda-checkoff-programs/#1acd0df14286","forbes.com",34,11,6,1,0,0,1,3

The FCC's proposed new rules, which had not taken effect yet, were sold to the public as ""privacy"" protections. The new overly restrictive rules would have tossed aside the previous Federal Trade Commission regulations that already required Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to give customers the option to opt-out of any sale of browsing information.   These FCC rules were supported by so-called ""edge providers"" like Facebook and Google. Under the proposal, Google would still have been able to use your personal information to sell advertising while ISPs would not. They wanted a competitive advantage to make money from this information while the ISPs would be sidelined by government rules.   I am committed to ensuring personally identifiable information remains private and protected. However, I do not support the government choosing winners and losers when it comes to regulating the marketplace.","status",NA,NA,127,178,28,8,2,1,0,99

This sobering report rightly recognizes the core driver of spending growth continues to be rapidly increasing autopilot spending. CBO projected last week federal spending on health care (excludes state expenditures) is projected to be $16.5 trillion over the next 10 years – exceeding the cost of both Social Security and the military. In 2047, major federal health care programs alone will consume all revenue from payroll taxes and corporate taxes combined. This is why dramatically rising health care costs must be addressed. The longer we wait, the more difficult it will be to correct course. If Congress does nothing, our children and grandchildren will likely face a crippling fiscal crisis.","link","http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/31/cboinfourcharts-fahey-170330-dc-.html","cnbc.com",43,59,13,0,0,2,1,9

This bill updates current law to help the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) to strengthen its recovery and prevention efforts. NCMEC is a unique public-private partnership that works with families, law enforcement, communities, schools, and local leaders to build a national response to crises and crimes affecting the most vulnerable children across the country.

Under current law, eligible veterans can choose to receive care in the community instead of through the VA health care system. In 2014, Congress passed the Choice Act after veterans died waiting to receive care due to secret waitlists at the Phoenix VA Medical Center. While aspects of the Choice program need to be changed and made more efficient, countless Virginia veterans have received faster care closer to home through this program.   I was proud to support this extension to allow the Choice Program to operate past the original sunset date and ensure certainty and continuity of care for veterans currently receiving health care services through the program.   President Trump knows the VA health care system is flawed and he has promised reform. Now Congress must act to identify a permanent solution by strategically considering how to best partner with the VA and community providers, reduce bureaucratic red tape, and ultimately better serve our nation’s veterans.","link","http://dailycaller.com/2017/04/05/congress-saves-veterans-choice-program-implemented-after-wait-list-scandal-before-expiry/","dailycaller.com",38,14,7,3,0,0,0,0

Christ’s death on the cross was the perfect act of love: sacrificing himself for the sake of others, even his enemies. The love displayed on the cross two thousand years ago was not dependent upon political affiliation, religion, or economic status. Easter signifies a time when we can set aside our agendas and recognize the powerful message of God sacrificing on the behalf of humanity.  Versions of that same self-sacrificial love has been on display since the founding of our country in individuals and leaders who lived out the greatest commandment of Christ -- to love our neighbor. It is this principle that has held together our nation through deep differences, darkness, and economic struggles.

The current system for H-1B visa workers does not put the interests of our country first, and rampant abuses to the system leave the American worker standing on the sidelines and often underemployed. During a time of heightened political divides, this is an issue both Democrats and Republicans in Congress can agree needs to be addressed.  Too often, companies capitalize on the loopholes in our immigration system to displace high-skilled American workers in search of cheap labor. I applaud the announcement of President Trump’s America First policy to return more American jobs to American workers by rooting out fraud, identifying necessary reforms and punishing companies exploiting the system for their own financial gain.","link","http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/330534-putting-the-american-worker-first","thehill.com",53,35,4,0,0,1,0,7

I wanted to clear up any confusion.  On Friday, I attended a White House signing ceremony for an Executive Order on energy. I was invited as the Chief House sponsor of legislation to lift the Obama moratorium on offshore drilling.  During the signing ceremony, the House of Representatives called an earlier than expected vote on what’s known as a Continuing Resolution or CR. That CR contained funding to keep the federal government open for one week while negotiations for a longer-term spending bill were ongoing. Unfortunately, while I rushed back from the White House, I missed the vote by minutes.  One Internet blogger mistakenly referred to this missed vote as abstaining from a $1 trillion spending bill.  Nothing could be further from the truth. The bill merely changed the date of the previous CR from April 28th to May 5th, which means it only spent 1.9 percent of the annual appropriation of $1.070 trillion. And I indicated in the congressional record last Friday, had I been present, I would have voted yes to give negotiators one more week to work on the larger bill.  At 2:18am this morning, negotiators posted a spending agreement for the remainder of the fiscal year which ends on September 30th. This bill will come to the House floor for a vote this week.   The spending bill will increase the deficit by $25 billion. It prohibits funding for the border wall. It does not reign in the EPA or defund Planned Parenthood. And it continues funding the federal government full steam ahead without any meaningful spending reductions or conservative policy riders. Frankly, it seems to fall short on virtually every conservative policy position.   I am still reviewing the 1655 page bill, but based on the summary provided with the legislative text I will have to oppose the legislation.","status",NA,NA,185,171,31,10,0,1,0,47

This year the State Department is anticipating a passport surge of at least 21 million applications, which is 5 million more than 2016.

Currently, processing times are 6-8 weeks for routine service, and 2-3 weeks for expedited service.

Trump delivered a powerful speech about freedom, faith, the American spirit, and what his leadership will look like on the global stage. His remarks weren’t just remarks to the Polish people, but a vision for his governing philosophy to affirm and defend the western tradition. Here’s a few excerpts, and if you haven’t seen it yet, it is worth watching.  “Through four decades of communist rule, Poland and the other captive nations of Europe endured a brutal campaign to demolish freedom, your faith, your laws, your history, your identity -- indeed the very essence of your culture and your humanity. Yet, through it all, you never lost that spirit. Your oppressors tried to break you, but Poland could not be broken.   And when the day came on June 2nd, 1979, and one million Poles gathered around Victory Square for their very first mass with their Polish Pope, that day, every communist in Warsaw must have known that their oppressive system would soon come crashing down. They must have known it at the exact moment during Pope John Paul II’s sermon when a million Polish men, women, and children suddenly raised their voices in a single prayer. A million Polish people did not ask for wealth. They did not ask for privilege. Instead, one million Poles sang three simple words:  “We Want God.”   …we can still hear those voices that echo through history. Their message is as true today as ever. The people of Poland, the people of America, and the people of Europe still cry out “We want God.”   …The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive.  Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?    We can have the largest economies and the most lethal weapons anywhere on Earth, but if we do not have strong families and strong values, then we will be weak and we will not survive. If anyone forgets the critical importance of these things, let them come to one country that never has.  Let them come to Poland. And let them come here, to Warsaw, and learn the story of the Warsaw Uprising.”","video","https://www.facebook.com/WhiteHouse/videos/1363753967045666/",NA,103,48,0,21,2,1,1,34

Nowhere is this more clearly seen than the Affordable Care Act.   As the ACA made its way through Congress in 2010, policy decisions were made based on flawed CBO projections, such as the one saying 21 million Americans would enroll in the insurance exchanges by 2016. The actual number was less than half that, around 10 million, and the miscalculation was disastrous for consumers.   CBO also miscalculated other economic impacts of the ACA. For example, they projected Medicaid expansion to cost $4,200 per enrollee. The actual cost turned out to be to $6,366 per enrollee. Likewise, CBO projected a 3.2 percent annual GDP growth under Obamacare from 2010-2016. The actual economic growth rate during that time period was 2.1 percent.   Again, both errors directly impacted budgets and consumers.”","link","http://washex.am/2tlHpBX","ashex.am",89,99,18,2,8,1,1,23

Their solution to get our economy moving are policies that hurt job creators and single out special interests through selective tax credits. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? Kind of like the policies over the last eight years that lead to 0.7% economic growth last quarter.   Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the extremists on the Left have resorted to guerrilla-style tactics to “resist,” and this movement has been embraced by Democrats in Washington. For the past six months, the organized Left has been disrupting town hall meetings and swamping Republicans social media platforms with hateful rhetoric. Meanwhile, Democrats who were elected to govern in the House and Senate have obstructed nominations, investigated every conversation, sued to stop legal executive orders, called for impeachment, and even made accusations of treason.  Outside the beltway, the American people have grown weary of these political games. They want constructive action from their elected representatives. They want serious policy discussions to change the trajectory of the forgotten men and women in our country. The bottom line is, they want Congress to deliver results.  After months of attaching themselves to the anti-Trump resist movement, yesterday Democrats traveled to Virginia in an attempt to disguise their failed liberal agenda with new terminology. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have led us down this failed path for eight years, and longer really, and it has been a raw deal for the American people. The economic policies of over taxation and massive regulations has resulted in anemic economic growth and stagnant wages. Their addiction to borrowing and spending racked up a $20 trillion debt we are now passing on to our children. And let us not forget, Democrats gave us health insurance and deductibles we couldn’t afford. The Left is destroying the energy sector that fuels our country and employs thousands of Americans with job-killing regulations that drive up energy costs and hurting those with the tightest budgets.  I trust the American people to get it right if we can get the government out of their way. That is why I am working on a positive policy-focused agenda that will help the American people, not the bureaucrats, politicians and special interests in Washington. I am working for a market based health care system where a young person can buy an affordable insurance plan without a government mandate. I am working for a tax code and regulatory environment that allows businesses to create jobs, pay higher wages, and provide healthcare benefits. And I believe the time is now to enact spending reforms to ensure the next generation will not face $20 trillion in debt or $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities.  I know the Republican-led House and Senate can do better. Some members of our own party have slowed down the President’s agenda and stood in the way of us keeping the promises we made to our constituents. This is why I called on the House to cancel August recess and roll up our sleeves to work on tax reform, get health care legislation over the finish line, and fulfill our constitutional obligation over the power of the purse to fund the federal government for the upcoming fiscal year. I believe the American people expect us to keep our word and deliver on a policy agenda that will return this country back to a limited federal government.","link","http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/24/politics/democratic-agenda-rollout","cnn.com",138,156,27,8,25,0,0,31

What's happened? His answer: we've mistakenly decided that if we ""put kids in a bubble,"" they'll ""come out stronger"" at the other end. ""These are 18- and 19-year-old kids that are at these college campuses,"" he said. ""They grew up dipped in Purell, playing soccer games where they never kept score...and we're asking them to be mature."" He called for ""the adults to start being the adults.""

Finding technically skilled workers to fill job openings is one of the biggest issues I hear about from business owners across the 7th District.

Bipartisanship and progress on key legislation to help our veterans might not drive up TV network ratings but I wanted to update you on a couple of items I have been working on to advocate for our veterans.  In February, the WINGMAN Act passed the House and awaits consideration in the Senate. The bill would eliminate the VA as the middle-man and allow certified congressional staff access to information from the VA regarding the status of a pending request from constituent veterans.   I sent a letter to the Secretary of the Department Veterans Affairs requesting that the VA examine the list of diseases linked to Agent Orange exposure based on a report conducted by the National Academy of Sciences.   In June, I introduced bipartisan legislation to codify current SBA lending practices to ensure over 76,000 veteran-owned small businesses in Virginia have the opportunity to utilize SBA’s export loan programs and are exempted from the up-front fees.   In July, I voted in favor of the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act was signed into law by President Trump. The bill brings much-needed accountability and reforms to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Under this bill, the Secretary of the VA will have expanded authority to remove VA employees who are bad actors. Importantly, the legislation protects whistleblowers to ensure accountability within the VA.   Also in July, I supported legislation that passed the House to update the post-9/11 GI Bill that also eliminates the 15 year time limit on the use of education benefits for new recruits. This bill now ready to be signed into law by President Trump.   And with my support, legislation to fund and extend the Veterans Choice Program was signed into law by the President last week. This program allows veterans to receive private medical care if they are forced to wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles to access a VA facility. This fulfills one of the core promises from President Trump to take better care of our veterans.   As you can see, it has been a busy year so far. It is a privilege to work to care for our veterans and service members and ensure they receive the care and benefits they were promised. Please know, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress are working to support the men and women who have so selflessly served our country.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepDaveBrat/photos/a.501000030051955.1073741829.400495463435746/889795781172376/?type=3",NA,109,73,14,6,0,1,0,8

If I am going to represent my constituents, I need to know what is going to be included in tax reform so I can have transparent and candid conversations with my constituents to get their feedback – I need to have the opportunity to take those ideas and specific policy proposals and discuss them with families, businesses, and local leaders who will no doubt be impacted. My concern is not just that we don’t have details, but we do not even know what individual or corporate rates are going to be or how S corps are going to be treated. We don’t even know if the average family is going to see a tax break. We have not received a single guarantee on a single issue within tax reform.","link","http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/12/republicans-tax-reform-jitters-trump-242568","politico.com",110,102,11,1,4,4,5,26

In what was a massive overstep of legal authority during the Obama Administration, the CPP would have imposed a huge energy tax hike on American families. All states would have been forced to shift from fossil fuels to using entirely renewable energy sources like wind and solar power by 2030. In Virginia, over 60 percent of our electric power is derived from natural gas and coal power – both of which would be completely prohibited under the CPP rule. The costs of compliance would be overwhelming – totaling an estimated $33 billion placed on American families. In comparison, the total annual revenue received by the Commonwealth of Virginia from taxpayers is $39 billion.  In addition to the economic price tag of the plan, the environmental benefits remain unproven and the legal justification murky enough to prompt the Supreme Court to intervene and halt implementation. I applaud Secretary Pruitt’s decision today to begin the process of repealing this unconstitutional regulation.","link","http://freebeacon.com/issues/clean-power-plan-repeal-will-save-33-billion-compliance-costs/","freebeacon.com",285,342,46,35,1,1,16,232

This translates into roughly $3,500 annually, on average, per working American household.""  This confirms projections released yesterday by the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA), which also showed how cutting the corporate tax rate and bringing trillions of dollars in profits back home from overseas will boost wages for hardworking Americans. It also aligns with Lawrence Lindsey's assertion that ""It would not be surprising to see real wage increases of 4% to 5%"" if tax reform is enacted.","link","https://www.speaker.gov/general/another-study-confirms-massive-wage-growth-corporate-tax-reform","speaker.gov",172,105,32,12,30,1,0,9

It will also remove bureaucratic delays to allow the Department of Health and Human Services to hire and appoint specialists with the tools and talent to address this health crisis. It will also shift resources within the Department of Health and Human resources to assist individuals eligible to substance abuse treatment programs.

It also contains $1 billion for Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program, extends funding for Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) for two years, and extends several public health programs by two years.
