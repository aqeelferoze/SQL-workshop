This move would have undermined the OCE’s independence by allowing the House to halt investigations and stop anonymous reporting.   The OCE was established in 2008 after a series of ethics scandals involving multiple GOP lawmakers. Today, the OCE is dedicated to investigating ethics complaints filed by the public and is essential to ensuring accountability, transparency and trust in our government.   Just this morning, my offices in Lakewood and D.C. received more than 50 phone calls in addition to tweets, Facebook comments and emails from constituents voicing their concern about this move from the Republicans. I encourage everyone to continue to share their thoughts, concerns and ideas with me and my office.

But we still have yet to see a real plan from Republicans to replace Obamacare.   The Republican strategy of ‘Repeal and Delay’ will create uncertainty for millions of Americans, cost taxpayers billions of dollars and do serious damage the healthcare system.   Across the country, Obamacare ended discrimination against people with preexisting conditions, allowed young people to stay on their parents’ coverage until the age of 26 and helped 20 million Americans gain health coverage.  In Colorado, 419,000 people have gained health coverage because of Obamacare. The uninsured rate dropped from 15.9% to 8.1%. Average annual family premium increases were cut from 7% to 4.8%.  Access to health care should not be contingent upon your income bracket or what job you have. The Affordable Care Act is civil rights act, and I will keep fighting to make sure every Coloradan has access to affordable health care.

""First, Obama responded to an actual threat — the discovery that two Iraqi refugees had been implicated in bombmaking in Iraq that had targeted U.S. troops. (Iraq, after all, was a war zone.) Under congressional pressure, officials decided to reexamine all previous refugees and impose new screening procedures, which led to a slowdown in processing new applications. Trump, by contrast, issued his executive order without any known triggering threat. (His staff has pointed to attacks unrelated to the countries named in his order.)  ""Second, Obama did not announce a ban on visa applications. In fact, as seen in Napolitano’s answer to Collins, administration officials danced around that question. There was certainly a lot of news reporting that visa applications had slowed to a trickle. But the Obama administration never said it had a policy to halt all applications. Indeed, it is now clear that no ban was put in place. Even so, the delays did not go unnoticed, so there was a lot of critical news reporting at the time about the angst of Iraqis waiting for approval.  ""Third, Obama’s policy did not prevent all citizens of that country, including green-card holders, from traveling to the United States. Trump’s policy is much more sweeping, though officials have appeared to pull back from barring permanent U.S. residents.”","link","http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/31/trump-travel-ban-similar-obama-claim/","denverpost.com",278,35,99,12,0,1,2,29

Was anyone else from the Trump campaign communicating with Russia prior to the election? What else will turn up in the ongoing FBI investigation?

That’s not right.  Here are five ways the Senate GOP health care bill would affect older Americans:  1. You will pay more in premiums if you buy on the open market. The GOP bill allows insurers to charge older Americans more and offers less in tax credits. 2. Your insurance might cover less. The GOP bill no longer mandates essential health benefits. 3. Your insurance benefits might be capped. The GOP plan rolls back this ACA protection. 4. Your Medicare benefits might be reduced. The GOP plan cuts more than $58 billion from Medicare. 5. You could lose your Medicaid coverage.

The new Republican healthcare proposal from Senators Graham and Cassidy would increase premiums, eliminate federal funding for Medicaid expansion, end the individual and employer mandate, cut protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and drop some essential health benefits such as prescription drug coverage or prenatal care. Like the other Republican healthcare proposals, this plan is heartless and would leave millions uninsured.  And Republicans are trying to ram it through without a hearing or a score from the Congressional Budget Office before September 30 so as to take advantage of a budget provision that would allow them to pass it with a simple majority of only 51 votes rather than 60.

That's why I helped introduce bipartisan legislation to help combat illegal North Korean financing by imposing strong financial sanctions, including prohibiting U.S. financial institutions from providing financial services to North Korea. Yesterday, this legislation passed the U.S. House of Representatives.  Like many Americans, I have serious concerns about escalating tensions with North Korea. North Korea’s recent cyber-attacks, missile launches and nuclear tests pose a direct threat to our national security, but tensions will not be solved through military threats alone. Instead, strong and steady diplomatic actions and financial sanctions are needed to bring North Korea to the table with the international community.","link","http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/356989-house-passes-north-korea-sanctions","thehill.com",37,2,5,0,1,1,1,0

These benefits are paid for by hardworking families across the country and by adding to the debt. This bill may save a few hundred dollars per person on their tax bill, but it will put more than $7,100 on the credit card for every man, woman and child in the U.S. which will lead to deep spending cuts on important programs like Medicare and Medicaid and jeopardize investments in infrastructure, education, healthcare, science and much more. While corporations will continue to reap the benefits after ten years, individuals will see their tax rates change and could even pay more than they are today. Meanwhile, the repeal of the individual mandate means health care costs will rise for everyone.   This is nowhere close to real tax reform that Colorado families and businesses have been seeking. It doesn’t simplify the tax code or make it more conducive for economic growth. In many ways, it adds more loopholes and rigs the system even more against hardworking families.  Since Republicans took control of the legislative and executive branch in January, I believe they have missed many opportunities to help hardworking families and grow the economy.
