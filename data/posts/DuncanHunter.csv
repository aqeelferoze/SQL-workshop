I've looked at valor awards in part to ensure our service men and women are rightly honored, but also because the process has been overly politicized and used as a mechanism to punish and retaliate.  Just look at the cases of Marine Lt Brian Chontosh, Sgt. Rafael Peralta, Major Matt Golsteyn and Earl Plumlee, among many others.  Excerpt:  ""At first glance, it seems low,"" said Congressman Duncan Hunter, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Marine officer. A California Republican, he has advocated on behalf of fellow veterans who've had awards downgraded and, as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, has been among the most high-profile to declare the military awards process both flawed and politicized. Hunter said he intends to examine each of the services' findings, once they're complete and made public.   ""The one major fact I keep going back to that blows my mind is not a single living person received the Medal of Honor for the Iraq war,"" the congressman told Military Times, referencing the exploits of a Marine officer, 1st Lt. Brian Chontosh, who received the Navy Cross for charging on foot through more than 200 yards of trench in Iraq. After depleting his own ammunition, Chontosh used discarded enemy weapons to kill more than 20 fighters who'd ambushed his Marines. ""Let's see if they remedied that — because that's just absurd,"" Hunter added. ""And let's see if they looked at some of the bigger cases, or if they just took the low-hanging fruit.""","link","http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/medal-of-honor-afghanistan-iraq-valor-awards-review","militarytimes.com",113,9,11,6,0,2,6,0

In just a few short months, President Trump has been decisive and unapologetic, whereas his predecessor was just the opposite …   “…A good way forward for President Trump and his national security team is to now leverage the missile strike to force Assad to the negotiation table in order to establish a reasonable path to peace.  Contingent should be the welcoming of an objective and independent inspection team to have a closer look at the claims and counter-claims around the use of chemical weapons—to ascertain the facts and inform any subsequent push for accountability and consequence to the furthest degree possible.    ""Any suggestion of submitting a ground force into Syria or initiating operations to remove Assad from power is a failure to learn the lessons of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  It can be done, but at tremendous cost, including lives.  Much like Iraq will never mirror the U.S. in politics and culture, we should not presume that Syria’s population centers could one day resemble a place like San Diego, California, or that a Syrian government is capable of one day resembling what we’ve come to know and expect from our own political institutions.”","link","https://townhall.com/columnists/congressmanduncanhunter/2017/04/19/the-way-forward-on-syria-n2315510","townhall.com",97,34,6,4,0,0,2,5

Today we celebrate Red Ribbon Week to honor his legacy as well as bring awareness to students, individuals, and communities about the dangers of drug abuse.  As President Trump recently outlined, the prescription drug and heroin epidemic is a matter of great national importance.  Ensuring there are adequate treatment options is crucial, as are preventative initiatives against the development of opioid dependence.  To address these problems, Congress passed two important pieces of legislation, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and the 21st Century Cures Act.  Both measures, which were signed into law at the end of last year, are aimed at combating this ongoing problem.  Further, in this year’s funding bill, Congress included $781 million toward addiction education, prevention, treatment and, just as important, support for our local law enforcement who are our front line of defense with this issue.   There’s no doubt there is more work to be done.  Let’s use Red Ribbon Week 2017 as a reminder that as great as the opioid epidemic is, it’s a challenge we can overcome.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/DuncanHunter/photos/a.10150307374209039.344472.79072979038/10155321635034039/?type=3",NA,58,13,7,3,0,0,7,0

So let's have some facts about what the bill actually does:  • Lowers individual tax brackets for low and middle income Americans to 0, 12%, 25%, and 35%.  Rates for high-income Americans is maintained at 39.6%;  • Preserves the home mortgage interest deduction and the charitable contribution deduction;  • Maintains the write off for state and local property taxes up to $10,000.  • Increases the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples;  • Doubles the exemption for the Death Tax and completely repeals the Death Tax in six years;  • Establishes a new Family Tax Credit, which expands the Child Tax Credit and preserves the Dependent Care Tax Credit;  • Retains popular retirement savings options such as 401ks and IRAs;  • Retains the low-income housing tax credit;  • Lowers the corporate tax rate to 20%;  • Allows businesses to write off the full cost of new equipment and the interest on loans;  All sounds good to me.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/DuncanHunter/photos/a.10150307374209039.344472.79072979038/10155338924214039/?type=3",NA,239,259,69,19,6,2,3,74

America lost 2,403 U.S. service personnel, 68 civilians and all but three ships of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.  Despite this loss, we gained something that day as well.  The hard lesson that if America was to lead, we had to be prepared.   December 7, 1941 has personal significance to my family.  Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, my grandfather, Robert O. Hunter, joined the Marine Corps and trained as an artillery officer where he eventually took part in the invasion of the Philippines at Leyte Island in October 1944 under General Douglas MacArthur.  This call to service influenced my father, Duncan L. Hunter, who joined the U.S. Army in 1969 and served in Vietnam.  60 years later, on September 11, 2001, this call to service came full circle when I joined the Marine Corps after the terrorist attacks on our nation.  The living-example the survivors of Pearl Harbor provide is ensuring that our military has the proper resources to protect and defend our nation.  As a Marine combat veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, I know the important lessons of Pearl Harbor and September 11 and I am unapologetically committed to keeping America safe and working on behalf of those who have taken on this responsibility.   As the years pass, the greatest generation gets smaller.  Only 558,000 of the 16 million men and women who served our nation in World War II are still alive today.  With each passing anniversary, let us never forget the thousands of Americans who were injured or lost their lives during the attack at Pearl Harbor, as well as the men and women who went to war to defend our freedom and serve alongside our allies.  Today I ask that you join me in honoring these heroes by sharing the name or photo of someone in your family who has served or is serving to defend our nation today.     #PearlHarborRememberanceDay","photo","https://www.facebook.com/DuncanHunter/photos/a.10150307374209039.344472.79072979038/10155422903099039/?type=3",NA,128,29,11,8,0,0,2,3

Obviously, people should listen to local media for updates and critical information regarding evacuation procedures.  Other important safety steps include: •  Back your car into the garage or park it in an open space facing your direction of escape. •  Keep your pets in one room so you can find them quickly if you have to evacuate. •  Arrange for a temporary place to stay outside the threatened area. •  Keep your indoor air clean – close windows and doors to prevent the smoke outside from getting in your home. •  Use the recycle mode on the air conditioner in your home or car. If you don’t have air conditioning and it’s too hot to be inside, seek shelter somewhere else. •  If smoke levels are high, don’t use anything that burns and adds to air pollution inside such as candles, fireplaces and gas stoves.

I am very pleased that the final product of this bill addressed many of the initial concerns that were raised, including ensuring provisions for wildfire disaster relief, maintaining the adoption tax credit, and protecting deductions for charitable giving, mortgage interest, state and local taxes and medical expenses.  This tax bill is an investment in America’s future by bringing good-paying manufacturing jobs and investment dollars back to the U.S. from Mexico and overseas, it’s an investment in the American people who know best how to care for their families and their future.
