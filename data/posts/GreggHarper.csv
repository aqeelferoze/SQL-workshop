It is clear that Mississippi family farmers are vital to our daily lives, so why then would we impose a tax on these family farmers that could jeopardize their livelihood and cost them the very farms that their family started through hard work and dedication?  MISSISSIPPI FARMERS DESERVE BETTER  The so-called “estate tax,” or Death Tax, is an extremely detrimental part of the current U.S. Tax Code. It puts a burden on these hard-working family farmers and, for many, diminishes their dream of one day passing their farm on to their children. Congress is working on a plan to change that.  We are soon going to submit a plan to remove this tax and restore the American dream to these hard-working farmers and their families. Tax reform means that individual families and small-business owners will be better off, and the U.S. economy will thrive.

On passage of this historic bill, Congressman Gregg Harper (R-Miss.) released the following statement:  “Today is an exciting day for all Americans, as Republicans in the House bring families one step closer to receiving real relief. The Tax Cuts & Jobs Act will provide more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks for hard-working men and women all across the country.”  The Tax Cuts & Jobs Act was written with simple goals in mind:  More Jobs: America has one of the worst tax codes in the industrialized world for businesses. By reducing tax rates for businesses large and small, our bill will level the playing field and make America the jobs magnet of the world.  Fairer Taxes: Our tax code is too complicated. By throwing out special-interest loopholes and consolidating deductions, our bill will make filing taxes so easy that you can use a form as simple as a postcard.  Bigger Paychecks: Americans' taxes are too high, so we are lowering individual tax rates for low- and middle-income Americans and eliminating excessive, costly taxes. That means you get to keep more of your hard-earned paycheck.","status",NA,NA,114,52,13,8,2,0,7,29
