First, with Trump attacking the media as ""fake news,"" attacking a judge whose decision he didn't like as a ""so-called judge,"" attacking U.S. intelligence agencies as operating in Nazi-like ways and attacking the entire U.S. Congress as unresponsive to the needs of the American people, he was moving this country in an authoritarian direction. The message that Trump is imparting to the American people is that he, and he alone, can be trusted. Make no mistake about it. This is an attack on our democracy and a movement toward authoritarian government.    Secondly, Sanders called Trump a ""fraud"" and a president who is disavowing virtually every campaign promise that he made to American workers, the elderly, the sick and the poor. Trump campaigned against cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid - but that's exactly what the Republicans are doing. Trump said, during the campaign; ""I'm not going to let Wall Street get away with murder. Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us. We're going to tax Wall Street.” Now, of course, he has appointed major Wall Street bankers to his financial team and is giving Wall Street exactly what they want.    Sanders said that the American people are going to resist Trump's movement toward authoritarianism on the streets, in Congress and in the courts. ""Too many Americans fought and died to defend American democracy to let President Trump move us in an authoritarian direction.  This is the United States of America.
