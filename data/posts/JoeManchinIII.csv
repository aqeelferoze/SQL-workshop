Betsy DeVos has spent her entire career advocating for school choice including public school vouchers and charter schools. This approach does not match the needs of our rural communities in West Virginia and would pull already limited public school resources from the schools, students and teachers that need them most.   Betsy DeVos has never attended or worked in a public school. The needs facing rural schools in West Virginia are unique and her lack of exposure to public education is very concerning for me. We need an Education Secretary who has an understanding of the needs of all children, including those with disabilities, and is committed to ensuring they receive a quality education.

We need an education secretary that understands the challenges that students, teachers, and schools in rural areas face. Betsy DeVos has spent her career working to privatize public schools, not investing in and improving them. The policies that she supports would divert already very limited public funds to private schools, reduce accountability from those schools, and significantly harm the public school system in a rural state like West Virginia. Betsy DeVos’s views are not in tune with the needs of the students and families in my state. My opposition to Mrs. DeVos is not personal or political. It is principled. While she is Secretary of Education, I will continue to fight to protect funding for our schools and teachers and ensure equal access to a quality education for all of our students.","video","https://www.facebook.com/JoeManchinIII/videos/10158049809405161/",NA,972,628,243,112,2,3,42,48

Over the past couple of years, many American businesses both small and large have joined the effort to hire veterans and are now doing their part in the fight to reduce our veterans’ unemployment rate. This is tremendous news, but while many employers claim to be veteran-friendly, there is no nationally recognized standard for employers to aspire to, or for future veteran employees to seek out. This bill will change that, and it is one more step we can take toward making it easier for our service men and women to find opportunities for good-paying jobs.

Judge Gorsuch has been questioned by the Judiciary Committee; Senators have met with him; and soon, we will cast our votes. After considering his record, watching his testimony in front of the Judiciary Committee and meeting with him twice, I will vote to confirm him to be the ninth justice on the Supreme Court.   Supreme Court jurists should have an extensive career in law, a record of upholding the Constitution in their rulings, an established judicial philosophy and an appropriate temperament. Judge Gorsuch’s legal career has spanned from Harvard Law School, earning a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford, clerking for two Supreme Court Justices, working for the Department of Justice, practicing law with a private firm, and being appointed to the bench of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals over ten years ago. Throughout Judge Gorsuch’s career, he has come to his legal rulings objectively, through the letter of the law rather than through his own opinion.  During his time on the bench Judge Gorsuch has received praise from his colleagues who have been appointed by both Democrats and Republicans. He has been consistently rated as a well-qualified jurist, the highest rating a jurist can receive, and I have found him to be an honest and thoughtful man. I hold no illusions that I will agree with every decision Judge Gorsuch may issue in the future, but I have not found any reasons why this jurist should not be a Supreme Court Justice.","status",NA,NA,975,1832,213,179,1,11,17,634

As I said when I voted against the Democrats’ nuclear option in 2013, I firmly believe that the filibuster is vital to protecting the minority’s views and exactly why the Framers of our Constitution made the Senate the ‘cooling saucer.’   As my predecessor the great Robert C. Byrd said in the months before his death, ‘While I welcome needed reform, we must always be mindful of our responsibility to preserve this institution’s special purpose.’ Senator Byrd will be rolling over in his grave today as we trample on the tradition and the institution of the Senate.   Every Republican Senator joined me in opposing the rules change then, but now, they stand united to do exactly what they opposed just 3 years ago. Frustratingly, both parties have traded talking points: Republicans say it’s about obstructionism and Democrats say it’s a power grab. Their shifting positions and hypocrisy is the one thing that unites them: both times, it was simply about doing what was politically easy instead of doing the hard work of consensus building. This is precisely what is wrong with Washington, and if it happens, both Democrats and Republicans will bear the shame.   I put party politics aside to support Judge Gorsuch because he is a most qualified jurist. I hope my colleagues will put partisanship aside and reconsider their position when we take this important vote on the nuclear option.

This isn’t the first time they have committed such a heinous crime. Four years ago, they attacked their people with chemical weapons and at that time, we believed there was a diplomatic solution. In 2013, I authored legislation and brokered an agreement that forced Assad and Russia to comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention and destroy all chemical weapons stockpiles and production facilities in a transparent way. But Assad and Russia have clearly broken that agreement and that trust, which is why I fully support the air strikes against the Syrian air base last night.   After a decade of war in the Middle East, I continue to believe we must carefully consider the implications of any escalation and should only commit American military might if there is a direct threat to our national security, but yesterday’s strike was important to send a message to the Syrian regime and their Russian enablers that these horrific actions will not be tolerated. As this situation develops, I also continue to believe that the President needs Congressional approval before moving forward with any direct military intervention.","status",NA,NA,274,127,42,17,0,2,3,15

As a former Governor, I understand how crucial it is for an executive leader to have his team in place. As the nation’s Secretary of Agriculture, I have confidence that Governor Perdue will work tirelessly to ensure that duplicative and harmful regulations that affect our farmers and agribusinesses are removed.   During my conversation with Governor Perdue, he recognized the importance of food programs to states like West Virginia and Georgia. Food insecurity is a major concern for many West Virginia families. About 282,900 West Virginians are considered food insecure, 82,220 of which are children. In fact, in 2015, it is estimated that food shortages caused West Virginia families to miss 49,943,800 meals. The Mountaineer Food Bank and Facing Hunger Food bank distribute food to all 55 counties in West Virginia and were able to provide 15,318,254 lbs of food in 2015, in part because of USDA programs. USDA’s food and rural development programs are vital to ensuring economic resilience for West Virginia and I believe that Governor Perdue can lead on this issue.    Governor Perdue has demonstrated that he will support landowners in their conservation efforts and management of natural resources. I believe Governor Perdue understands the importance of sportsmen and sportswomen to our heritage and to our economy and I believe we can work together to ensure that we are expanding opportunities for these groups. The prosperity of rural America should be a priority for this Administration and Governor Perdue will help ensure that forested states like West Virginia are able to unlock greater economic potential and are not left behind. West Virginia should be a big part of that conversation and I look forward to working with Governor Perdue to make that happen.","status",NA,NA,138,74,11,9,0,1,2,24

Families, communities and businesses were devastated. But, as we always do in times of challenge and trial, West Virginians bounded strongly together. Local fire halls and churches were food pantries and safe havens. First responders and National Guard members, as always, were heroes. And West Virginians from all backgrounds and corners of the state were organizers, ambassadors, and philanthropists.   From the high school students who built tiny houses for flood survivors, to the volunteers who cleaned out homes and delivered supplies, and the neighbors who never forgot one another, the meaning of ‘West Virginian’ is now more deeply carved in stone. West Virginian means open, giving hands. It means casseroles and phone calls. It means friendly waves and encouraging friendships. And it means faith and conviction in the face of loss and adversity.    President John F. Kennedy once, now famously, said “The sun does not always shine in West Virginia, but the people always do.” Last year at this time, the sun wasn’t shining – but as the floodwaters receded, our spirit would shine once again.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/JoeManchinIII/photos/a.10150152465810161.398532.10150135395755161/10158743517840161/?type=3",NA,68,7,14,12,0,0,6,0

The United States of America is still the greatest country on Earth and the hope of the world, even with all our challenges and troubles. It is up to us to keep our torch of freedom burning bright for generations to come. This holiday, let us all show our patriotism and pride in being citizens of the greatest country ever known.  While Independence Day is a time to commemorate the anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, it is also a time to reflect on our nation's history and core values by honoring those who have risked their lives to defend and protect our nation, and who continue to do so today. It is because of their unwavering service that we continue to live with freedom, opportunity and equality. I proudly join every West Virginian in honoring the members of our Armed Forces and their families for the sacrifices they have made.  What makes our state and nation so special is the creative and giving spirit of our citizens. We have an inner light that burns so bright that no one can keep us down or defeat us. We come together in difficult times in times of war and in times of tragedy. May God continue to watch over our flood-damaged communities, give comfort to all of those impacted and give us strength and guidance as we continue the great progress we have made in rebuilding our state.  I share the pride all West Virginians feel in America and in the Mountain State, today and every day, and I wish you a very happy and safe Fourth of July.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/JoeManchinIII/photos/a.10150152465810161.398532.10150135395755161/10158786920205161/?type=3",NA,230,24,17,7,1,0,0,1

This public health crisis declaration will give states like West Virginia the flexibility to enlist help from federal agencies and resources to combat this epidemic. At the declaration announcement, I was pleased to hear that Zohydro, a drug that I have been trying to get off the shelves since 2013, is being pulled from the market. Because of this painkiller’s high potential for misuse and abuse, Zohydro poses a severely dangerous threat to our communities in West Virginia and across our country and I’m glad this horrible decision by the FDA will finally be made right. I have long pushed for many of the actions that the President is taking, including expanding access to treatment options and educating our children on the risks associated with drugs, especially opioids, in order to make long-term improvements.   West Virginia faces unique challenges in the crisis, especially the rural areas in our state. The expansion of telemedicine to these areas is a game changer and will allow people struggling with substance use disorder the ability to receive opioid treatment prescriptions without seeing a doctor, which is a huge hurdle for many West Virginians. A large part of recovery and becoming a contributing member of society is finding meaningful employment and President Trump’s expansion of the Dislocated Workers Grants will help people who are struggling to find work because of their disorder, which works with the goals of my Clean Start Act. This public health declaration is a great step and I look forward to working with the President to put real funding behind these changes.","link","https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-praises-president-trumps-opioid-public-health-crisis-declaration","manchin.senate.gov",379,195,57,21,6,8,5,48

We’re one of the most patriotic states in the country, and this Veterans Day let us all reflect on the men and women of not only our state, but our entire country, who chose to sacrifice so much so that we may all sleep soundly.   These Veterans are our brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers; they’re our neighbors and our coworkers. And though it is important for us to take the time and honor them this Veterans Day, I encourage all my fellow Americans to stand with them and appreciate their service each and every day. We have known that our service members have valiantly risked their lives abroad for generations, but are just now recognizing the invisible wounds that Veterans endure when they return home. While the Department of Veterans Affairs’ is second-to-none when dealing with combat related injuries like Traumatic Brain Injury, polytrauma, and mental health, there is still so much more to be done to ensure the safety and well-being of our nation’s Veterans. As a member of the Senate on the Committee on Veteran’s Affairs as well as the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue to work to eradicate the issues of homelessness, joblessness and lack of adequate healthcare access that affect far too many Veterans.   So on this Veteran’s Day, I encourage us all to thank a Veteran. Show your sincere gratitude for those who risked their lives to keep our country the strongest in the world.  Freedom is not free, and it is their commitment to liberty and patriotism that makes me proud to call myself an American.

I visited the White House with my Republican colleagues to meet with President Trump, I assembled meetings with his economic team and my Senate colleagues, and I offered idea after idea to try to make this bill bipartisan. I took this seriously, because tax reform is too important to be done on party lines, and anything that is done in such a strictly-partisan way is not good for West Virginia or the country as a whole. Despite my efforts, this bill does not work for West Virginia: It hurts our seniors, leaves the middle class paying more, and tilts the playing field against small businesses while irresponsibly adding to our growing $20 trillion national debt.    Let me be clear, I support sustainable tax cuts to grow our economy and raise wages, but this rushed bill is nothing more than a sugar high with an old fashioned bait and switch, where 79% of West Virginians will end up paying more in just a few years. It hurts seniors by triggering a $25 billion cut to Medicare next year. It hurts families by raising the average healthcare cost for a family of four by nearly $2,000 each year. It hurts students and their families by ending itemized deductions they rely on. It hurts our historic cities who rely on historic credits to revitalize Main Street and create jobs. It hurts our grandchildren by adding $1.5 trillion to our already staggering debt. And as our deficits continue to grow it significantly harms our military readiness, the ability to equip our National Guard to respond to domestic emergencies, and ability to properly care for our Veterans.

I was honored to be invited to the White House on multiple occasions to meet with the President and know that he was genuine in his desire to make this a bipartisan tax bill that helped the working class, grew jobs and made our businesses competitive in the global economy.   I tried to work with my Republican colleagues in the Senate to make this truly a bipartisan bill like Ronald Reagan did. Unfortunately, it was clear from the time Senator McConnell passed his irresponsible budget, that he had no intentions of working in a bipartisan way, and instead, wanted to use the tax bill as a political tool that adds a minimum of $1.4 trillion to our national debt.   I am truly disappointed that this process turned partisan, because I believe our country needs real tax reform and anything that is done in such a strictly-partisan way is not good for West Virginia or the country as a whole.   When we started this process I believed that real reform needed to meet four goals: it needed to focus on permanent relief for working class families; make small businesses and corporations competitive in a global economy and set an environment for job growth; be fiscally responsible and not grow our debt; and simplify the tax code.   Unfortunately, I do not believe that this bill meets those goals. It hurts seniors by threatening severe cuts to Medicare next year and it hurts families by destabilizing the healthcare market raising the average healthcare cost for a family of four by nearly $2,000 each year.  I do believe that this bill will provide temporary relief to some working class families, and I will work with the President to make those permanent, so that hard-working Americans can plan for their future like the corporations and very wealthy individuals that are receiving extremely large and permanent tax cuts will do.   Despite my best efforts, this bill does not work for the future of West Virginia: It hurts our seniors, leaves the working class paying more, and tilts the playing field against small businesses while irresponsibly adding to our growing $20 trillion national debt.    During my first few months in the Senate, Admiral Mike Mullen, who was Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that he believed the single biggest threat to our national security is our national debt. This has stuck with me during my time as a United States Senator and has hardened my resolve to get our national debt under control.   While I am disappointed that we were not able to take advantage of this historic opportunity and pass real tax reform, I will continue to work with President Trump to help the working class and reign in our debt – something I know he cares deeply about.","status",NA,NA,498,670,104,11,40,8,68,129

That is 28% higher than 2015. That is 115 people dying every day.   There has not been a year since I have been in the Senate that opioid overdose deaths have gone down, and this year is no different. Despite my best efforts to work with Congressional leadership and two administrations for nearly a decade, our country still cannot properly combat an epidemic that is ravaging our nation and that will change every aspect of our society for generations to come. After all of the trauma our neighbors, families, and friends have been through and after all of the strain we’ve put on our community, state, and local budgets and resources, we still do not fully appreciate the devastating impact of this crisis and continue to do far too little to stop it.   What we are doing is not working and it is clear that we must double, triple or quadruple our efforts to strengthen addiction prevention efforts, get people into treatment, and prevent overdose deaths. We must help those who are suffering from substance use disorders get the help that they need so they can find a job, get their children back, and become a contributing member of society. We must rebuild our communities. For too long, we have focused on Band-Aid solutions as this crisis has compounded into too many societal issues to count.   If we are serious about fixing this problem, we need targeted emergency funding to save lives now and permanent funding for treatment centers that can save lives tomorrow.  We need to commit to passing my legislation, the LifeBOAT Act, which would creating a permanent funding stream by placing a one cent fee on every milligram of opioid produced. This would bring in about $2 billion a year. We must also require that our medical professionals are properly trained on addiction and the dangers of opioids, we must ensure that our federal agencies are treating this as the public health crisis it is, we must fight for patients with substance use disorders to get the quality, coordinated healthcare that they need, and must give people who are in recovery a second chance to rebuild their lives. I have legislation that would do all of these things. I just need other public officials to step up and join me in this fight.  Congressional leaders, government officials and my colleagues should be alarmed by the rate in which people are dying. By now, they should know that this problem and its consequences are not just going to go away and that I’m not going to go away or sit idly by as millions of Americans just continue to die. As a nation, we cannot accept this anymore.","status",NA,NA,66,172,39,2,3,3,33,15

In the short term, United Rentals of Beckley loaned the food bank a forklift. Yesterday, Toyota Motor Manufacturing West Virginia delivered a permanent forklift.
