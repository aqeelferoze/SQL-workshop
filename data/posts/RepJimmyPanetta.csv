First – even though I don’t get a vote on President Trump’s cabinet appointees (only Senators get to vote on cabinet picks), I have major concerns with his appointees’ public statements on environmental, social, and economic issues. Rest assured that I will fight for the progress we’ve made as a country these last eight years.   Second – I vehemently disagree with President Trump on many levels and believe his campaign was filled with divisive rhetoric, a tone that he’s carried with him into the White House.   Third – I firmly believe that diversity within the Central Coast and nation must be valued, not belittled. To put that into action, I am pleased to share that I joined the LGBT Caucus which pushes for equality and social justice for the LGBT community, and the Pro Choice Caucus to advocate for policies that advance the reproductive health care needs of women.   Fourth – I believe the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) should be repaired, not repealed, and I oppose efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. Additionally, in my very first floor speech as a Congressman, I urged my colleagues to protect health care for women.   Fifth – as the grandson of immigrants who realized the American dream of freedom, prosperity, and equality, I am extremely disappointed by President Trump’s decision today to sign anti-immigrant executive orders. I firmly believe that diversity within our country must be valued, not belittled. President Trump’s orders do not reflect our Central Coast values of inclusivity, equality, and striving for the American dream, and now thousands of hardworking immigrants in our communities may bear the brunt of this destructive policy. I will continue to advocate for bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform, champion the current protections afforded to DREAMers in our community, and oppose any efforts to repeal DACA.

We discussed a wide range of topics, including research on pesticide resistance and disease resistance, and how industry experts are working to increase the nutritional value of food. The station also provides a learning center for students from both Hartnell College and the UC system to conduct research that is applicable to California agriculture.

This past week, disappointedly and disturbingly, our executive branch did a disservice to our nation's fundamental values by making disgraceful decisions based on intolerance, racism, and fear. That type of insular reaction is contrary to the historical responsibilities of our nation to welcome those fleeing terror and persecution.    When my grandparents came to this country to attain the American Dream, they were welcomed by the Statue of Liberty.

That law enforcement action led to the arrest of several gang members who have committed serious and violent felonies in the local area. The operation capped a five-year covert investigation into a violent criminal street gang and, according to law enforcement officials, was not focused on violations of immigration laws.  While I agree with federal law enforcement actions that target violent criminals and enhance our public safety, I will be requesting greater transparency and clarity from DHS when it comes to the execution of these types of raids in our communities. Currently, there is a great amount of uncertainty and fear in our immigrant community. That feeling is understandable considering the recent events, including the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) raids that were executed last week across the nation. Although those raids apparently were planned during the Obama administration, that Administration made clear its priorities for removal, which included convicted criminals and individuals who posed a threat to public safety, border security, and national security. The Trump administration’s priorities on immigration are not clear due to the recent Executive Order on deportation, that could be interpreted to apply to every undocumented individual present within our borders.    I will continue to demand communication and clarity from DHS and ICE, and I will be meeting with representatives of those agencies. As I discussed during my immigration town hall on Sunday in Salinas, however, it is important to be prepared and know your rights when it comes to immigration enforcement procedures.

I stand with our local Santa Cruz Police Department (SCPD) and Chief Kevin Vogel, and will continue to work with them to demand complete information from ICE about the scope of the operation.   I am in touch with federal immigration agencies. I called ICE on February 13th, and have followed up with DHS multiple times demanding information and transparency.  Members of our community should not live in fear that they may be detained or deported, or that their children may be separated from them, because of who they know or where they live.   What’s worse, the breakdown in trust between ICE and SCPD puts our communities at risk. People in our community are already rightfully fearful due to the administration’s recent anti-immigrant executive orders and directives. SCPD has a very successful community policing record, and works every day to retain trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement because doing so is paramount in keeping our neighborhoods safe. ICE has violated and betrayed that trust.  I will continue to demand communication, clarity, and transparency from DHS and ICE, and I am working with my colleagues on the House Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee to hold ICE accountable for their actions.","link","http://www.ksbw.com/article/santa-cruz-police-chief-blasts-homeland-security-over-ice-raid/8971295","ksbw.com",206,50,60,5,0,12,5,29

First, I spent the majority of the week working to help our communities impacted by the back to back storm surges. Our towns have hardly had time to recover from the January storms before being pummeled again over the holiday weekend. I was able to tour the damage in Santa Cruz and Big Sur, as well as other communities across the region. I spoke with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to advocate for our communities and to better understand how they are coordinating with CalOES to address the needs of those affected. We have received a presidential disaster declaration for the storms that occurred from January 3-12, and assessments on damage caused by following storms is ongoing. I will continue to monitor these assessments and push for federal resources to provide assistance.   I spoke with UC Santa Cruz students about how DACA has helped them succeed. I sat down with senior citizens in Santa Cruz to discuss protecting our health care, then with Santa Cruz for Bernie to discuss local issues. The DCMP Democratic Club of the Monterey Peninsula and I discussed ways we could continue to fight for Democratic priorities at home and in Washington.  On Wednesday, I spent the day at the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center meeting with students, faculty, staff, and military cadre. I spent the following day at Fort Hunter Liggett, touring the facilities for the first time since taking office. There, I participated in a ribbon cutting ceremony for their newly dedicated athletic field and Operational Readiness Training Complex. It was a humbling experience, being surrounded once again by the brave military men and women who serve our country.   Later in the week, I sat down with the Monterey County Farm Bureau to discuss agriculture and farm bill priorities, and participated in a California Department of Food & Agriculture listening session to hear from producers in our district. Alongside California Secretary of Agriculture Karen Ross, I heard feedback from the growers and shippers of the central coast to help me get a better understanding of the challenges they face in their business, how current programs function, and improvements they would like to see as my committee negotiates the next farm bill.  I also spoke with the NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) about protecting our environment. I then discussed the importance of public investment in protecting and preserving our region’s natural beauty and public lands at the Sustainable Hospitality Development Symposium in Monterey.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJimmyPanetta/photos/a.227651347684005.1073741828.198585430590597/256668478115625/?type=3",NA,72,5,2,3,0,0,0,0

I have seen first-hand the incredible, positive impact National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) programs have on our country – most recently as a former member of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council, and when I worked on a NOAA ship conducting oceanographic research off the coast of Alaska. Maintaining funds for NOAA programs that protect our natural resources and educate the public are critical for our environment, recreation, tourism, university science programs, marine-research institutions, and our $2.8 billion ocean-related economy.   I have also seen first-hand the incredible destruction caused by wildfires. Clearly, funds for fighting fires are vital to our communities, but just as important are funds for preventing fires. We must recognize that sustained government investment in fire prevention, like federally established fire breaks, are imperative in keeping our communities safe.   I grew up on the Central Coast. I believe that having our district’s parks, monuments, and marine sanctuary in my backyard during my formative years made me who I am today. I want my daughters to have the same positive and irreplaceable experiences that I had, and that starts with advocating for the funding of programs that are vital to the preservation and protection of our natural resources.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJimmyPanetta/photos/a.227651347684005.1073741828.198585430590597/257050894744050/?type=3",NA,127,2,2,7,0,0,0,0

Today, I joined my Democratic colleagues from the House and Senate to speak out against the AHCA and the devastating impact it would have on Veterans.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJimmyPanetta/photos/a.235846863531120.1073741829.198585430590597/267283910387415/?type=3",NA,161,18,31,5,0,2,3,15

Moving forward, members of Congress on both sides of the aisle must come together to build upon the progress the Affordable Care Act made in protecting the most vulnerable Americans. We must address insurance cost increases, and make health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans.","status",NA,NA,252,44,14,7,0,1,0,4

That is why one of our nation’s most popular symbols signifies our enlightening enterprise, our ideals, & our humanity.   No, it is not a 30 foot wall, but the Statue of Liberty. The first thing my own immigrant  grandfather saw when he arrived to this country. A great risk, leaving the known for the unknown, to give his children and grandchildren a chance at the American Dream.  We must realize that our nation is still being built. We are constantly being reborn and we gain new strength from people like the 64 I met today.    Our nation's potential will only be reached and our country can only continue to be built when we all continue to take risks and ​participate in our democracy.

Most of these products will be on store shelves within 24-48 hours – truly a farm to table experience.

It would deny basic living standards for low-income families, seniors, and the disabled through massive cuts to Medicaid, Social Security, SNAP, and Meals on Wheels. It would disproportionately impact our rural communities, slashing funding for critical rural development programs while also failing to support our growers, shippers, and farmworkers who support our local economy. It would cut investments in job training and student loan programs. Millions of families would have a harder time putting food on the table, and thousands of working families would lose the opportunity to become home owners. It would cut environmental research programs and enforcement of clean air and clean water programs, threatening our environment.  While it is important to have a strong defense and national security budget, it cannot come at the expense of cutting other programs on which Americans depend. I will not support these proposed cuts, and I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this harmful budget. We must instead work together to advance a responsible budget that helps our constituents and strengthens our communities.

The bill would create a program that would allow agricultural workers and their families to apply for a “Blue Card” that gives them legal status and work authorization if they show consistent employment in U.S. agriculture over the past two years, pay a fine, and pass a thorough background check.  A 3- to 5- year path to citizenship is provided to those who continue to work in agriculture for the requisite amount of time.  Immigrant farmworkers are not only the backbone of our nation’s agriculture industry, they and their families are the heart and soul of many rural communities. They plant and harvest the food that goes on our dinner tables and enrich the social, cultural, and historical fabric of our society. If Congress continues to ignore our nation’s severe labor shortage, our agriculture industry will suffer, perishable produce will be left to rot in our fields, and families will see an increase in their grocery bills.

I spoke about how growing up on the central coast of California instilled in me a sense of responsibility - to protect our pristine coastlines, our marine sanctuary, our environment, and our ocean.   This weekend, my daughter, Gia, and I watched a marine mammal release in Monterey. She couldn’t stop smiling and giggling when she saw the five seals splash around in the water. She’ll never forget that moment, and I’ll never forget her laughter.  Over the last six months, the administration has taken some steps that will make it harder to protect our environment and oceans. From shrinking our responsibilities in international treaties dealing with climate change, to signing an executive order with the goal of finding mineral and energy potential in our National Marine Sanctuaries and National Monuments, to signing a ""Proclamation for National Ocean Month” that in my opinion is more of a doctrine for oil exploration.   I’m not sitting back while all of this is happening. Every day, my colleagues in Congress and I are fighting this administration when it comes to protecting our oceans. Because we believe that when we protect our oceans, we protect our security. Our national security, when it comes to sea level rise affecting not only our coastal communities, but our military bases. Our food security, when it comes to solving ocean acidification and researching aquaculture. Our environmental security, when it comes to keeping our oceans, sanctuaries, and monuments free from oil spills and plastics.  We can’t do it alone, we need innovative leaders to think outside of the box and help us fight to protect our environment. But we have to act. I hope that our legacies will be reflected in the laughter of children when they experience the joys of our oceans. We cannot give up.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJimmyPanetta/photos/a.227651347684005.1073741828.198585430590597/303746120074527/?type=3",NA,51,5,3,4,0,0,0,0

At the end of each week when we are in session, I will share with you a list of the legislation that Congress passed with strong bipartisan support.    Here are some of the bills that we passed this week in the United States House of Representatives:  • We passed the Improving Services for Older Youth in Foster Care Act, which amongst other amendments, authorizes states electing to extend foster care eligibility up to age 21 to extend assistance and services to youths who have aged out of foster care but have not yet reached age 23. • As well as the Reducing Unnecessary Barriers for Relative Foster Parents Act which requires the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) to identify model standards for licensing foster family homes, and requires each state to inform HHS whether its licensing standards are consistent with the model standards identified. • The Disaster Assistance Support for Communities and Homeowners Act passed unanimously. This bill directs FEMA to provide technical assistance to common interest communities to ensure they are aware of their existing eligibility for certain disaster assistance, and the steps needed to receive such assistance. Currently, such communities may be eligible for debris removal aid for roads they maintain as well as other assistance for certain other ""governmental"" services they perform. • The Accelerating Individuals in the Workforce Act passed, which authorizes state demonstration projects within the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to temporarily subsidize employment for TANF beneficiaries with willing employers in an effort to help those low-income individuals enter into the workforce and gain permanent employment. • We passed the Coast Guard Improvement and Reform Act, which will create uniformity with regard to the Coast Guard's advisory committees and to clarify Coast Guard authority when it is operating as a special service in the Navy. • The ADVANCE Act, Active Duty Voluntary Acquisition of Necessary Credentials for Employment Act, passed unanimously. This bill would allow military reservists and active-duty members of the armed forces who drive specialized vehicles while in the military to use that experience toward obtaining a commercial truck driver's license. • The Veterans Expanded Trucking Opportunities Act of 2017 passed unanimously. This bill will allow VA medical practitioners - advanced practice nurses and physician assistants, who are licensed, certified or registered in a state to perform physical examinations - to become certified to conduct physical exams of veterans for commercial truck drivers licenses.","status",NA,NA,101,21,3,3,0,0,0,0

It takes time and thought to respond effectively to this request to review a number of federal actions spanning a decade and impacting hundreds of millions of acres.  Protecting and preserving our treasured resources drives the local economies in many communities, and residents should have sufficient time to provide input and voice concerns about possible changes resulting from this review.  We wrote, in part, to Secretary Ross:  ""While we recognize that the terms of the Executive Order require that the Department report to the White House by October 25, 2017, meaningful public participation will require a comment period longer than thirty days. Furthermore, the Order specifically requests comment on the adequacy of Federal, State, and tribal consultations conducted prior to the eleven designations or expansions.  Extending the comment period would give these same entities a better opportunity to provide critical input as part of this review. Public input and community engagement are hallmarks of the National Marine Sanctuaries program, and such a short public comment period is inconsistent with the processes that created and expanded the affected sanctuaries. We strongly urge you to extend the public comment period to at least ninety days.""","link","https://www.peters.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Public%20Comment%20Letter_Signed.pdf","peters.senate.gov",63,7,11,2,0,0,0,0

That inaction has created a lot of uncertainty for our agriculture industry and the hardworking people who feed our families. Our communities are relying on us to act. That’s why I’ve joined my colleagues in the House to cosponsor the Agricultural Worker Program Act, also known as the Blue Card bill.  This bill, which was a provision within of the Senate’s 2013 bipartisan immigration reform bill, would help address the current labor shortage facing producers throughout the central coast of California. This bill limits the pool of undocumented immigrants to workers who can prove employment in the U.S. agricultural industry for at least 100 work day over the last two years after enactment. The bill also requires participants to prove employment in U.S. agriculture for at least 100 days per year over the next 5 years to adjust their status to permanent residency.  The Blue Card bill is one part of a larger conversation about reforming our broken immigration system. This bill will help ensure the people who live, work, and contribute in California can step out of the shadows and continue to move our economy forward.

The young people, brought to the United States as children, enrolled in DACA to be protected from deportation and to earn their citizenship. I arranged the roundtable in response to President Donald Trump’s announcement on Tuesday that he would terminate the DACA program, calling on Congress to consider legislative solutions.    The Dreamers I met with told me about their families, their lives, and their hard work to be a part of and positively contribute to our community. Their parents took great risks to bring them here to give them a better life. These young men and women are well aware of their obligation to give back to the country that gave them so much opportunity. In order to fulfill that responsibility, each Dreamer works hard to succeed in school, at work, for their families and our community. Now, they are threatened with potentially being forced to leave the only country that they are so proud to call home. Democrats and Republicans in Congress must work together to pass legislation that provides Dreamers throughout our community and country the opportunity to fulfill the American Dream.   At the roundtable, I took the Dreamers’ questions, listened to how the DACA program has positively impacted their lives, and heard their concerns about the end of the program as it stands. I also discussed my efforts to protect Dreamers, sharing that I am working to pass legislation that would ensure permanent resident status to DACA recipients and others working to become citizens. California is home to 1 in 4 of the nation’s total DACA population, and an estimated 20,000 Dreamers currently live in California’s 20th congressional district. I will take what he learned back to Washington to share with my colleagues in Congress as we debate long-term solutions.     Prior to the roundtable, I held a press conference, where he and two Dreamers currently enrolled at Hartnell College highlighted the contributions Dreamers make to our economy, our communities, and our country.","status",NA,NA,287,235,33,59,57,0,2,13

We discussed, among other topics, what Congress is doing for DACA recipients.   There are a number of bills related to DACA being debated by members of Congress. I’ll highlight three. The BRIDGE Act, the Bar Removal of Individuals who Dream and Grow Economy, is the congressional equivalent to DACA. If passed, it would give a three year extension of the DACA program. While I support the BRIDGE Act, I do not think that Congress can stop there, because it is merely a temporary fix to keep Dreamers in this country. The second, the RAC Act, Recognizing America’s Children Act, meets the requirements of DACA and provides conditional protected status for ten years, and establishes certain eligibility requirements. The third, the DREAM Act, of which I am a cosponsor, is a pathway to citizenship for students to have a chance to earn legal status if they came here as children, are long-term U.S. residents, have good moral character, and complete two years of college or military service in good standing.  The reality is that in order to vote on any of these bills, the majority’s leadership needs to bring these pieces of legislation to the floor of the House of Representatives. We need to make sure that the majority understands the importance of passing long-lasting legislation to ensure that DREAMers can continue to give back to our country. As a former prosecutor, I know the importance of evidence when making a case. That is why I held a press conference at Hartnell College, where two young women shared their stories about how DACA has positively impacted their lives, and held a roundtable with thirty Dreamers to learn more about their experiences. It is also why I wanted to meet with this working group. They are doing a great job for our local immigrant community. I am thankful for our discussion.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJimmyPanetta/photos/a.227651347684005.1073741828.198585430590597/344536762662129/?type=3",NA,36,3,2,0,0,0,0,0

Carlos Curbelo (R-FL-26), to make federally funded infrastructure more resilient to flooding.   Flooding is the most common weather-related event, occurring in 90 percent of natural disasters in the United States. Federal flood-related disasters have cost American taxpayers approximately $51 billion between 2005 and May 2017 in FEMA Public Assistance spending alone. According to the National Institute for Building Sciences, every dollar invested in mitigation results in $4 saved in recovery costs. Making the proper investments now to prevent the higher costs of flooding in the future represents sound, fiscally responsible public policy.    We on the central coast of California well understand the impact that flooding has on our region. As we have seen with the recent storms in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the risk of severe flooding is a reality for communities across the country.   Congress is preparing to make historic investments to rebuild communities devastated by recent hurricanes, and working to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program, so it is critical that flood mitigation policies are adopted for federal infrastructure projects.

HHS recently announced that it would shut the site down for 12-hour periods on every Sunday but one throughout open enrollment.  We wrote:  “The recent announcement by HHS regarding planned shut downs of HealthCare.gov during the 2018 Open Enrollment Period is incredibly concerning. These shut down periods will amount to a full three days in which Americans will not be able to enroll and access health coverage. Furthermore, this does not take into account that HHS has already reduced the time that Americans will be able to enroll this year by 47 days (a 51 percent time reduction) as compared to the 2017 Open Enrollment Period. By contrast, the HealthCare.gov website was online 99.9 percent of the time during the 2015 and 2016 open enrollment periods…  On behalf of the millions of Americans who will have more difficulty or will not be able to sign up for and access health insurance coverage because of the many decisions made by HHS and President Trump, we ask that you take the simple step of tailoring website maintenance to shorter durations during times with low traffic or compensating for the lost hours due to maintenance by adding time to the end of the open enrollment period.”  Added together, the scheduled Healthcare.gov shutdowns would shorten open enrollment by three days. The Trump Administration previously announced that it would cut the duration of open enrollment in half to 45 days after 2016’s 90-day period.

The Gold Star Family Support Act would require the Secretary of Defense to issue common installation access cards to Gold Star spouses and dependent children for life. These cards will allow families to attend memorial events, visit gravesites, and access benefits for which they are already entitled. It would also extend on-base commissary, exchange, and MWR facilities access for all surviving spouses, regardless of remarriage, who have dependent children of the deceased service member under their guardianship. Current Department of Defense policy rescinds on-base benefits to surviving spouses of deceased service members who remarry, even when there are dependent children under guardianship of surviving spouse who remain eligible for benefits, effectively rendering these benefits inaccessible by the children of the deceased member.     Since World War I, the gold star symbol has been used by American families to honor members of the Armed Forces who have given their lives in service to the nation.

Both the 2001 authorization for use of military force following the 9/11 attacks and the 2002 authorization for use of military force against Iraq are outdated and need to be replaced. In order to best meet the current national security interests of our country, Congress must pass a new and narrow authorization focused on the threat posed by al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and ISIS.  With this bipartisan legislation, we can meet our obligation to provide our service members with clear guidance as they fight to keep us safe. We can also provide our constituents the assurance that, no matter who our commander-in-chief is, Congress will assert its constitutional authority to define the use of our military force around the world.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repmikecoffman/photos/a.10150802117139493.468439.366142384492/10155738336219493/?type=3",NA,84,15,0,5,0,0,0,0

Huge congratulations to local UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics Ryan Foley and his team!   ""For the first time, two neutron stars in a nearby galaxy have been observed engaging in a spiral death dance around one another until they collided. What resulted from that collision is being called an ""unprecedented"" discovery that is ushering in a new era of astronomy, scientists announced Monday. In a collaboration with UC Santa Cruz, Carnegie Observatories were the first in the world to discover this event. They were able to collect early data just before, during and after the collision and study it in more detail. The discovery confirms that gamma-ray bursts can result from the collision of neutron stars, as well as that heavy elements are created as a result of violent collisions between stars. It confirms what these neutron stars look like when they collide. And it confirms that gravitational waves and light can happen together.""","link","http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/16/world/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves-light/index.html","cnn.com",118,5,23,8,0,17,0,0

Common post-disaster fraud practices include:  • Fake offers of state or federal aid:  o Beware if anyone claiming to be from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the state visits, calls or emails asking for an applicant’s Social Security number, bank account number or other sensitive information.  o Avoid scam artists who promise a disaster grant and ask for cash deposits or advance payments in full.  o Know that federal workers do not solicit or accept money. FEMA and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) staff never charge applicants for disaster assistance, inspections or help in filling out applications. Do not give out information and report people claiming to be government workers to local police.  o Provide your Social Security number and banking information only when registering for FEMA assistance, either by calling 800-621-3362, TTY 800-462-7585, or going online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov or the smart phone FEMA App. If you use 711-Relay or Video Relay Services, call 800-621-3362. Operators are multilingual and calls are answered from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week.   • Phony housing inspectors: Owners/applicants may be especially vulnerable to phony housing inspectors claiming to represent FEMA or SBA. An applicant should always:  o Ask to see the inspector’s identification badge. All federal employees and contractors carry official, laminated photo identification.  o Inspectors also have each applicant’s nine-digit registration number.  o FEMA inspectors never require banking information.  It is important to note that FEMA housing inspectors verify damage, but do not hire or endorse specific contractors to fix homes or recommend repairs.  They do not determine your eligibility for assistance.   • Fraudulent building contractors: When hiring a contractor, be sure to:  o Use licensed local contractors backed by reliable references.   o Demand that contractors carry general liability insurance and worker’s compensation.  • Bogus pleas for post-disaster donations: Unscrupulous solicitors may play on the sympathy for disaster survivors. Disaster aid solicitations may arrive by phone, email, letter or face-to-face visits. Verify legitimate solicitation:  o Ask for the charity’s exact name, street address, phone number, and Web address, then call the charity directly and confirm that the person asking for funds is an employee or volunteer.  o Don’t pay with cash.  o Request a receipt with the charity’s name, street address, phone number and Web address (if applicable).  Anyone with knowledge of fraud, waste or abuse may call the FEMA Disaster Fraud Hotline at 866-720-5721 or report it to the Federal Trade Commission at www.ftccompliantassistant.gov You may also send an email to DHSOIGHotline@dhs.gov","link","http://www.disasterassistance.gov/","disasterassistance.gov",24,1,9,0,0,1,1,1

Should this bill be signed into law, families of all income levels on the central coast of California will be among the hardest hit in the nation. This bill eliminates many of the deductions that are critical to my constituents, including the medical expense deduction, student loan interest and lifetime learning credits deduction, and deductions for teachers who pay for classroom supplies out of pocket. It caps the state and local tax deduction at $10,000, far below the average $23,000 deduction claimed by over 177,000 households in California’s 20th Congressional District each year, and eliminates the mortgage interest deduction claimed by 57% of local homeowners.  I voted against this bill because it will hurt people who live on the Central Coast. The Majority party promised that H.R. 1 would give every American a tax cut. That is not true, and many on the Central Coast could end up paying more in taxes than they do already.  True reform of the American tax code must be a collaborative, bipartisan effort. I hope that the Senate comes together to reject this bill, and creates a bipartisan tax plan that is fair for all Americans.","link","https://panetta.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-panetta-statement-passage-house-tax-bill","panetta.house.gov",196,104,78,3,2,3,64,102

I understand how people feel about Congress and the partisanship that can occur. However, we are working together to pass many bills.   I have been a bit behind in sharing with you a list of legislation that Congress has passed with strong bipartisan support. Here are some of the bills that we passed this month in the United States House of Representatives:  • The House unanimously passed a resolution on Anti-Harassment House Training, H Res 630 , which requires all employees of the House of Representatives, including all Members, to complete every year an anti-discrimination and anti-harassment workplace training program. • HR 1066, VA Management Alignment Act of 2017, which requires the VA to report to Congress on its organizational structure with recommendations for possible changes to promote effectiveness and accountability. • HR 3122, Veterans Care Financial Protection Act, which requires the VA to warn veterans about financial scam artists. • HR 2123, Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support (VETS) Act, to improve the ability of health care professionals to treat veterans through the use of telemedicine. • HR 2601, Veterans Increased Choice for Transplanted Organs and Recovery (VICTOR) Act, to improve the access of veterans to organ transplants. • HR 425, FTO Passport Revocation Act of 2017, which authorizes the State Department to revoke or deny U.S. passports to individuals who become affiliated with foreign terrorist organizations. • HR 3017, Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment and Reauthorization Act. The bipartisan bill reauthorizes the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Brownfields program through FY 2022 at the current funding level. The Program provides grants and technical assistance to communities, states, tribes and others to assess, safely clean up and sustainably reuse contaminated properties. • HR 2228, Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act, which aims to address police officer occupational stress by identifying and incorporating current best practices from other high-stress occupations, and by providing additional resources for law enforcement officers to better manage their stress and associated problems. • HR 2331, Connected Government Act, which requires websites created by the federal government to be mobile friendly, thereby codifying the existing executive branch guidance on federal websites.","status",NA,NA,27,10,2,3,0,0,0,0

Republicans cannot rely on Democratic votes to resolve this problem without working in a bipartisan way to address the uncertainty their tax bill will cause to the economy and the health care system.  The Republican tax bill would increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion, triggering automatic PAYGO cuts to mandatory spending, including $25 billion from Medicare and additional cuts to farm safety net programs and others critical to our economy and our people.  Last week, Speaker Ryan and Senator McConnell promised wavering Republicans in the House and Senate that PAYGO cuts would not be triggered as a result of passing their tax bill without indicating how such automatic cuts would be waived.    In today’s letter, we made clear that their support for a waiver cannot simply be assumed without some corresponding action to stabilize health care markets.

As co-chairs of the Democratic Caucus’ National Security Task Force, here is what I and my colleagues, Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida, have to say about it:  The Trump administration has finally released its legally-required National Security Strategy document, as we called for in June.  As we have witnessed over the past 11 months, the administration’s actions have not aligned with the language of this document.  There is a fundamental disconnect between what the administration says, and what it is actually doing.  For example, the Task Force has urged the administration to use all elements of our national power, pairing a robust military posture with a forceful diplomatic presence.  The document pays lip service to this notion, stating that “diplomacy is indispensable.”  These words ring hollow in light of the fact that the administration has clearly sought to hollow out the State Department and marginalize diplomacy as a national security tool.  Likewise, the Task Force has encouraged the administration to strengthen, not subvert, alliances.  The document states that our “allies and partners are a great strength of the United States.”  Yet, as a result of the President’s actions and rhetoric, our most important partners in Europe and Asia have cause to question the U.S. commitment to our shared security.  It is no surprise that confidence in U.S. leadership has fallen sharply among our closest allies.   In addition, the document says the U.S. will “offer encouragement to those struggling for human dignity in their societies.”  This restates a core American principle, promoted under both Republican and Democratic administrations.  However, this statement rings hollow, given the President’s praise for Russian President Vladmir Putin, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, and other authoritarian leaders.  More generally, the Task Force has expressed our dismay that the administration has yet to name or nominate personnel for numerous critical positions at the Departments of Defense and State.  A strategy document—even if sound—is merely words on paper unless the administration has the men and women in place to execute that strategy around the globe.     The credibility and importance of the National Security Strategy rely entirely on the actions of the administration and alignment of these actions with the document's stated goals. To date, these actions have not reflected the goals in the strategy and represent a turn towards an undemocratic, inward-looking approach that stands as a poor excuse for American leadership.","link","https://www.dems.gov/coalitions/national-security-task-force/","dems.gov",50,27,24,1,1,0,6,7

Jimmy Panetta","2017-12-19","2017-12-19 21:06:35","I voted against this tax bill because it would have a negative impact on too many families on the central coast of California and our nation. The bill lowers taxes for the wealthy, while raising taxes on many working and middle-class families. The bill would leave millions without health insurance or with increased premiums. It sets the stage for massive cuts to critical services and entitlements to my constituents and support for our communities. It will add $1.5 trillion to the national debt.   Most disconcerting, the bill caps the state and local tax deduction at $10,000, far below the average $23,000 deduction claimed by over 177,000 households in California’s 20th Congressional District each year. The plan also reduces the limit on the mortgage interest deduction, which will have a detrimental impact on high-cost housing markets in our district.   I believe that we need bipartisan tax reform crafted through an evidenced-based process, with deliberative hearings and input from a wide range of experts. Instead, we were presented today with a partisan bill that was rushed through Congress without sufficient vetting. As a result, we were left with a bill that will not meet the needs of Central Coast middle-class and low-income families, and will only exacerbate the challenges that they and our nation currently face.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/us/politics/tax-bill-vote-republicans.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0","nytimes.com",132,57,3,0,1,0,14,19
