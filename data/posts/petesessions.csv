We have finally turned the page and have started a new chapter for our country. One that unleashes the free-enterprise system, puts hard working Americans back to work, and creates more opportunities for all Americans.  This week the House worked to put this agenda in motion by passing three critical measures that responsibly reform our regulatory system while enforcing measures of accountability, transparency, and integrity. Regulations have run rampant these last eight years but enough is enough. Republicans have made a concerted and focused effort to eliminate unnecessary rules and regulations to give the American people the relief that they need.","status",NA,NA,67,59,3,7,1,0,0,23

Whether employees are balancing a full time position while attending school or a single parent is working two jobs to provide for their children, the needs of our workforce have evolved. As our workforce changes so must our laws that protect and govern them. Currently, only public sector employees have the ability to choose paid time off instead of cash wages as compensation for working overtime hours.  Employees in both the public and private sector should have the same opportunities to balance their work and personal obligations.  That is why I proudly voted to overhaul this outdated law to provide all members of the 21st century workforce the flexibility they need and deserve.

It is a failing system that restricts choice, makes health care unaffordable for American families, and is a major reason why our economy has seen stagnant growth since 2010.   Although today's vote is a first step to address the failures of the current health care law, we must be deliberate, thoughtful, and responsible in working to produce a sustainable solution to fix our broken healthcare system.  Health care is an issue that impacts every single American.  While this bill is not perfect, I believe it is far superior to the health care system we have now.   It is my hope that my colleagues in the Senate will continue to use this time to develop a better system that brings millions more of Americans to the health care system, not millions less.
