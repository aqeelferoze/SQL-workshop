As Chairman of the Interior Subcommittee, I’m especially pleased that we were able to fund increases in programs like the Diesel Emission Reduction Program, which clean our air by leveraging modest federal investments with state and private dollars. The bill also provides critical increases in resources for our military to improve readiness and training. I’m especially pleased that the bill provides our troops with a much deserved 2.1 percent pay raise for the military, instead of 1.6 percent that had been requested by former President Obama.  Make no mistake, this is not a bill that Nancy Pelosi would have written.  In total, the bill includes a $1.5 billion increase in funding for border security, including more agents and tools to stop illegal activity. Combined with the Trump administration’s elimination of the misguided ‘catch and release’ policy, this funding will help further curtail the flow of illegal immigration across our borders. We also rejected calls to increase the D.C. bureaucracy at agencies like the EPA, which we hold to its lowest staffing level since 1989, and prohibit a number of job-killing regulations.

I have heard from many of my constituents and the city of Lake Elsinore regarding their concerns with the LEAPS Project. FERC should deny any attempt to fast-track the project and take into account the many questions and complicated issues surrounding the LEAPS Project. The region around Lake Elsinore has changed dramatically since Nevada Hydro first submitted its environmental documents and original application in 2007. The outdated documents and significant community concerns make it vital that FERC deny the waiver request and follow a deliberative process that fully scrutinizes the project.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepKenCalvert/photos/a.10152021729258424.1073741829.70063393423/10154973750373424/?type=3",NA,85,43,17,4,0,1,1,6
