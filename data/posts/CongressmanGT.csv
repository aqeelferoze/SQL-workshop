H.R.  115, the Thin Blue Line Act,  would increase the penalty for someone who targets or attempts to kill a law enforcement officer, firefighter or any public safety officer. If passed, this bill will help deter individuals from targeting officers solely because of the uniform they wear.  I also proudly cosponsored H.R. 613, the Lieutenant Osvaldo Albarati Correctional Officer Self-Protection Act. This legislation honors the life of Lieutenant Albarati who was ambushed and murdered as a direct result of his work at a federal prison in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. Additionally, it directs the Bureau Of Prisons to provide a secure storage area located outside the secure perimeter for correctional officers to store their personal firearms.
