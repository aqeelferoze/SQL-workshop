The independence of our judicial system — especially the Supreme Court — is more critical now than ever. That is the context in which I will review this Supreme Court nomination.  In recent years, the Court has shifted dramatically toward big money corporate interests at the expense of American workers and small businesses. This Supreme Court seat does not belong to President Trump or the GOP. It belongs to the American people, and I’ll make sure their voices are heard in this debate.","link","https://nytimes.com/2017/01/31/us/politics/supreme-court-nominee-trump.html","nytimes.com",1511,512,138,100,6,9,16,149

I have said repeatedly that this act of cyber warfare must not go unanswered, so I was deeply disturbed that Mr. Tillerson showed so little concern, and offered no plan to respond or hold Russia accountable. Secretary Tillerson’s close personal and business ties with President Putin give me no confidence that he would be an effective force in America’s dealings with Russia. There have even been reports that this Administration is considering dropping sanctions against Russia. There is bipartisan opposition to that idea in Congress, which will conduct vigorous oversight of the State Department.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/politics/rex-tillerson-secretary-of-state-confirmed.html?_r=0","nytimes.com",2199,847,215,129,15,12,102,405

It would take away health care for people with pre-existing conditions, like asthma, diabetes, cancer, high-blood pressure, and Alzheimer’s. It would increase costs for seniors and rural communities. It would give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and, according to the Illinois Health and Hospital Association, eliminate 60,000 good paying jobs in Illinois for working families. It would also allow insurers to once again exclude coverage for maternity care, mental health, and substance abuse treatments.   And by gutting Medicaid, Trumpcare would greatly affect millions of seniors, lower-income families, children, and even students with disabilities across the nation.

A new study by the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation found that the Administration’s ""own actions are triggering double-digit premium increases” for Americans across the country.   Trump’s sabotage tactics are well-documented. On his first day in office, he instructed federal agencies not to enforce the Affordable Care Act—despite it being federal law. Next he cut the open enrollment period in half, and cancelled TV and radio ads that educate people about how to enroll for insurance. To this day, President Trump still refuses to commit to paying cost sharing-reduction subsidies that help make health care affordable for hard-working American families — causing chaos and confusion in our health care system. Don’t take my word for it: Illinois insurers have stated that the proposed premium increases in Illinois next year are a result Trump’s actions.   This is flat wrong. The President of the United States should stop playing politics with the health care of innocent Americans.  Instead, he should join us and listen to what Americans across the country are calling for: a bipartisan effort to stabilize and strengthen our health care system.  https://apnews.com/cc6b335865e24a4b843dc0e2c4cc6c7a/Study:-Trump-actions-trigger-health-premium-hikes-for-2018?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP_Politics","link","https://apnews.com/cc6b335865e24a4b843dc0e2c4cc6c7a/Study:-Trump-actions-trigger-health-premium-hikes-for-2018?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP_Politics","apnews.com",623,832,513,16,57,24,111,849

I was the first member of Congress to call on President Obama to establish DACA – which was based on legislation I wrote called the Dream Act – and now it had finally come to pass. The Dreamers’ love of country moved me. Their enthusiasm and determination was a sign of things to come. Since that day, we’ve seen Dreamers become teachers, soldiers, engineers, and leaders in their communities. I’m proud of them.    But today, 800,000 Dreamers are living in fear of being deported from the only country they’ve called home. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton plans to sue President Trump if he doesn’t rescind DACA — a direct threat to Dreamers and their communities across the country. Dreamers like Barbara Olachea, who knew she’d have to work harder than anybody else so she went on to graduate as her high school's valedictorian. She now attends Dartmouth College. Dreamers like Luis Gonzales, who spends his time mentoring high school kids and dreams of being a high school teacher. Dreamers like Father Rey Piñeda, whose faith in America’s promise will never dim. His deportation would be a tragedy for the hundreds of people in his congregation who he serves as their priest.

Second, I will do everything in my power to defend DACA, and pass my bipartisan Dream Act and comprehensive immigration reform once and for all.     http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/us/illegal-immigrants-line-up-for-deportation-deferrals.html","link","http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/us/illegal-immigrants-line-up-for-deportation-deferrals.html","nytimes.com",1007,406,108,135,12,10,129,70

Perhaps President Trump thinks it's comical or fun to ‎hurt American families out of spite. The actions he's taken this week — to roll back benefits required by insurance plans and to cut-off payments that help keep health care costs low for working families — certainly make it seem that way.   As a result of this most recent action, individual market premiums will increase 20% next year and 25% by 2020. These are people’s lives we’re talking about.  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/us/politics/trump-obamacare-executive-order-health-insurance.html?_r=0","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/us/politics/trump-obamacare-executive-order-health-insurance.html?_r=0","nytimes.com",105,178,107,10,5,3,30,192
