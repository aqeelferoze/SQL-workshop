I respect each of them - those who disagree with me as much as those who agree with me - for exercising our most precious, God-given right of free expression.  After the radio program, I went out to the group and promised I would honestly answer their questions and asked in return that they let me speak without drowning out my answers.  And that began some genuine, open, respectful conversation that touched on a range of issues including healthcare, gun control, the environment, and of course President Trump.   As I shared with my constituents tonight, I grew up with a Mom who was a progressive democrat and a Dad who was a conservative republican.  They loved each other and I love and respect both of them.  Talking with this crowd tonight was like dinner back at home.  I'm grateful for those who took the time to make me a better representative and I always welcome the opportunity to have productive conversations with my constituents.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanTomMacArthur/photos/a.1608396126058029.1073741828.1608353306062311/1951396888424616/?type=3",NA,219,69,23,12,0,0,0,1

But I didn't run for Congress to be an obstructionist or to decorate a fancy chair - Washington has enough of those people already - I worked to constructively improve the legislation.  I’ve always said that this has to be about people, not politics. My wife and I had a special needs child in our early twenties and we had over one million dollars of medical bills when she died at the age of eleven. Without insurance, our life would have had a terrible blow before we even got started. I am committed to helping every American get the health insurance they need.   Over the past weeks, I worked with President Trump, Vice President Pence, Speaker Ryan, HHS Secretary Tom Price and Members of Congress with different views, about my concerns. I offered and fought for specific improvements that needed to be included in the legislation in order for me to support it.   I successfully worked for $60 billion in additional funding for older and disabled Americans in Medicaid and made sure that everyone in Medicaid Expansion - including over 500,000 New Jerseyans - could remain there permanently with a full federal match.  I proposed and gained a $90 billion increase in the healthcare tax credits for Americans in the 50-64 age group.  These additional credits were intended to help this group, which struggles with among the highest health insurance costs.  And late Thursday, just before the scheduled vote, I was able, along with others to secure an additional $15 billion to help young mothers and those struggling with mental and substance abuse disorders.   In total, we committed an additional $165 billion dollars to the most vulnerable among us. But this was never about money. Despite all the fear and confusion over this bill, I worked to make it better for people - those I represent and all Americans.   This bill was not perfect—no bill is—but it was a dramatic improvement from where it started.   It didn't have enough votes to pass, but I stand by my efforts to improve it.  The only way we’re going to repair our broken health care system is if we work together to fix the problem.  Just saying no, which requires no effort at all, or pointing the finger of blame at others is of no value. It is time for action together.","status",NA,NA,176,239,45,10,4,0,1,77

It’s my job to represent them the best I can.”  “I came to Washington to roll up my sleeves, and work with both parties to shape policy. That’s been my approach to finding solutions to tough problems, like repairing our health care system.  And because of this—I’ve been getting attacked from outside group from both sides of political spectrum.

Some are saying that my vote would end your internet privacy protections. This is simply not the case.   Earlier this year the FCC decided to delay the regulation I voted to repeal, meaning it never even took effect. My vote did not change your current level of privacy protections. You also do not have to worry about your personal information being sold. It was, and is still illegal, under the Communications Act, for an ISP to sell your social security number and many other types of personal information.    My vote to repeal this regulation simply levels the playing field and ensures that there is one high standard for your protections across the internet. You’ve probably noticed advertisements popping up online for a website you recently visited. This is because companies have used your online activity to target you with specific advertising. Keep in mind, the regulation I voted to repeal would not have prevented this from happening. It would have allowed some companies to continue doing this, while changing the rules for others.   You should know that you can opt-out of allowing your ISP to share your browsing data by simply asking that they discontinue the collection and sharing of your data for marketing purposes.   While there is certainly a lot of noise surrounding this issue, much of it is intentionally misleading, thanks to special interest groups with a clear agenda.

It’s the highest number of drug-related deaths our country has ever seen. It’s more deaths than the peak of the AIDS epidemic in 1995. In a single year, we’ve lost nearly as many Americans to drug overdose as we lost in battle in World War I. Almost as many as was lost in 12 years in Vietnam.  At the midpoint of this fiscal year, the Coast Guard is combating a sharp uptick in cocaine flow, and has already removed nearly 243,000 pounds. CBP has also reported a 39 percent increase in cocaine seizures, for a total of approximately 43,600 pounds. They’ve also seen an increase in heroin and methamphetamine seizures—and again, it’s only halfway through the fiscal year.  This is why it's important that members from both parties work together to combat this crisis. There is still so much work to be done.","status",NA,NA,16,40,4,2,0,0,0,5

My mother died when I four years old and I watched my father, who had no insurance, struggle his whole life to pay off her medical bills. My first daughter, Gracie, was born with severe special needs, and passed away at the age of 11.  The emotional cost to our family was devastating and the financial cost added up to more than $1 million in medical bills. This is the perspective I’ve carried with me as I’ve negotiated to make this bill better.    Over the past weeks, I’ve worked with President Trump, Vice President Pence, Speaker Ryan, HHS Secretary Price and my House colleagues to ensure the most vulnerable Americans were protected under the AHCA and everyone else's costs could come down.   I successfully worked an additional $165 billion dollars to the most vulnerable among us. This included $60 billion in additional funding for older and disabled Americans in Medicaid and made sure that everyone in Medicaid Expansion - including over 500,000 New Jerseyans—could remain there permanently with a full federal match.  I proposed and gained a $90 billion increase in the health care tax credits for Americans in the 50-64 age group and secured an additional $15 billion to help young mothers and those struggling with mental and substance abuse disorders.   Last week, I introduced an amendment to the AHCA that would make coverage of pre-existing conditions sacrosanct for all Americans and ensure essential health benefits remain the federal standard. Protecting preexisting conditions was critical for me and I could not support legislation that did not maintain this standard. In my amendment, states have the option to obtain a waiver from some federal standards, but the state must attest that its purpose is to reduce the cost of health care or increase the number of people with health care coverage. Under no circumstance can states obtain a waiver for pre-existing condition protection—period.  This option gives flexibility to the states to decrease costs while maintaining important protections.    I’ve said many times that this bill is not perfect, but it’s an improvement from where it started and I stand by my efforts to make it better.  It’s important that Congress was able to pass the AHCA and take this important step that will provide the American people with patient-centered, affordable care.","status",NA,NA,293,978,143,27,0,1,30,447

We're covering preexisting conditions differently than Obamacare, and in a way that will allow everyone else's premiums to come down as well.

I know that not everyone agrees with my views, but I owe my constituents honest answers and I'm grateful I could meet with them.  There has been a lot of misinformation about the health care legislation in particular, and I wanted to address this face-to-face with my constituents—whether they agree with me or not.  The truth is that the individual health care insurance market is failing, and if we don't fix it, millions of people will be hurt.  This is not something I can ignore.  I understand the fear and anxiety people are feeling, but it struck me that many people seem unable to respectfully disagree with others who share different views than their own.  I know many of my constituents have genuine concerns about the direction of the country, but we can’t become a nation that won’t listen to one another.  Last night, I heard people resort to deeply personal attacks, insults and name-calling, while others shouted down not only me, but their neighbors.  This is no way to solve the big problems facing America.  We have to be willing to admit that maybe someone else is right too, which is why I listened to my constituents for 5 hours.  I went to Congress to fix the big issues facing our nation—not just to win elections.  Neither side of the aisle should be cheering, jeering, nor shouting at each other while we try to do what we believe is right for America.  Too much is at stake to simply view everything through a political lens.   Residents of New Jersey’s Third District have given me the privilege of representing them in our nation’s capital—it’s not something I ever forget or take lightly. It’s my hope that my constituents understand—through all the noise—that I’m trying to help not take anything away from them.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanTomMacArthur/photos/a.1608396126058029.1073741828.1608353306062311/1994183784145926/?type=3",NA,184,512,42,11,7,0,3,141

To this day, I am still making a lot of these memories. Although there is a copious amount, the memories I have made at F-Cove stick out the most. That place has always held a special place in my heart. When it would snow during the school year, all I would think about is the first day in June when I hop on my boat and cruise out to that magical place. Most of my neighbors would also go there so it was like a block party on the water. To this day, the opportunities at that oddly shaped cove are endless. If you want to swim, tan, eat, listen to music, read, or anything else, there’s a good chance you could do it there. Racing friends on the boat and then meeting them out there, this all adds up for one fun day. Now I must admit, the beaches here in Brick are cool but nothing beats F-Cove. It’s like a private beach without all the people. Don’t get me wrong, I love the beach, but I would take a boat ride to F-Cove any day. This is one of the reasons I’m thankful to live in this area. No matter how many times we go, I can still have loads of fun and to me, that’s an awesome thing to have.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanTomMacArthur/photos/a.1608396126058029.1073741828.1608353306062311/2037033346527636/?type=3",NA,27,12,1,0,0,0,0,0

Shaneen is a law-abiding single mother who was facing years in prison because her concealed-carry permit was considered illegal once she crossed from Pennsylvania to New Jersey. This legislation will ensure that what happened to Shaneen does not happen to any other law-abiding gun owners by requiring states to recognize each other’s gun carry permits, while recognizing states’ rights to create their own firearms laws.    Opponents of this bill will argue that this legislation will enable dangerous people to obtain firearms. This is completely false. This bill, will allow a law-abiding citizen to carry concealed gun only if they are not federally prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm. Additionally, this bill has nothing to do with gun purchases. Every person who wants to buy a firearm would still have to go through a thorough federal background check and in fact, this bill beefs up the Federal Instant Background Check system. This legislation will ensure legal gun owners, like Shaneen Allen, won’t have to fear arrest when they cross state lines.","status",NA,NA,239,268,60,38,0,1,2,106

Businesses like these, and their employees, will help our economy grow with real tax relief they receive in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanTomMacArthur/photos/a.1608396126058029.1073741828.1608353306062311/2100223266875310/?type=3",NA,85,80,4,13,3,0,0,18

I’m grateful that members from both parties supported this critical piece of bipartisan legislation that will bring common sense reform to FEMA. Since I first came to Congress, I’ve been willing to work with anyone to help natural disaster victims, like those impacted by Superstorm Sandy, who have been treated unfairly by FEMA.

It was meaningful and I really enjoyed it.    This congregation is an important part of our community and I am grateful for their invitation to visit. Places of worship like Baitul Qayem, are vital to our state because they teach community building, and values like peace and character, which was the subject of the Imam's talk during the prayer service.   They provide people comfort in times of need, care for those who are less fortunate, and enable people to come together and express their faith. Learning about different cultures, treating our neighbors with respect, and listening to the perspective of others is how we can continue to move our country and society forward, which is what I talked about in my remarks.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanTomMacArthur/photos/a.1608396126058029.1073741828.1608353306062311/2105547386342898/?type=3",NA,71,42,9,3,0,0,0,4
