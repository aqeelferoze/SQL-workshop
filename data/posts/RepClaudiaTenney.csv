I would like to thank the Steering Committee, House Leadership and Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling for their confidence in my experience and proven leadership on these issues. I am eager to begin working with Chairman Hensarling and my colleagues to implement our bold vision and reform-oriented agenda that will improve our financial and regulatory policies.  As a longtime small business owner, I learned firsthand the devastation that out-of-control regulatory policies have had on our community, especially our community-lending institutions and the small businesses and farms that need access to credit line.  Our work is vital to the health of the United States economy. Consumers, borrowers, and lenders all need relief from the onerous and duplicative compliance regulations that reduce growth and hurt small businesses including the agricultural industry, which is vitally important to the economy in the 22nd District.    New York’s 22nd District is largely compromised of small businesses, which create nearly 70 percent of the new jobs in our communities. Unleashing these entrepreneurs will help the rebirth of our job creation efforts, which is the top mission in our region.  As a member of the Financial Services Committee, I will work to roll back the failed financial policies that have hindered job growth in our region. Dodd-Frank and other burdensome regulations have proven to be a drag on our economy and our country.","link","https://tenney.house.gov/media/press-releases/committee-assignments-115th-congress","tenney.house.gov",14,3,0,0,0,0,0,0

The United States has no better ally than Israel, and we must make it clear to the world that America stands by Israel. The UN’s one-sided resolution undermines the peace process and further complicates the difficulty and complexity of negotiations between Israel and Palestine, while failing to hold the Palestinian Authority accountable for its unwarranted aggression toward the people of Israel.   The US should work to bring peace to Israel and oppose political attacks against the Jewish state that undermine hopes for meaningful bilateral negotiations. The Obama Administration’s disregard for longstanding policies in support of Israel should be rejected without reservation. I am hopeful that Congress and the Trump administration can work together to reverse the Obama Administration’s damaging policies, which have only increased instability in the region and further jeopardized Israel’s security.","status",NA,NA,7,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

These men and women have bravely dedicated their lives in service to our communities. Every day, they put their lives on the line to keep us safe.   The job of a law enforcement officer has become increasingly dangerous and difficult. Last year alone, 135 police officers were killed in the line of duty, a number that grew 10 percent from the previous year.

The HALOS Act removes a regulatory burden that requires angel investors to complete onerous paperwork before attending showcase events, which are intended to introduce entrepreneurs and investors. This regulation has made it increasingly difficult for angel investors to connect with entrepreneurs looking for opportunities to open a new business. This bill passed the House with strong bipartisan support, 344-73.  The HALOS Act works to cut red-tape and roll back burdensome regulations, giving entrepreneurs looking to start or grow a business the chance to easily connect with investors. This important piece of legislation will help support our business community in the 22nd district by rolling back Washington’s excessive regulations, giving startup businesses easier access to capital and credit. The disconnect between Washington and Main Street is clear—small businesses with fewer than 20 employees face a cost of 45 percent more per employee to comply with federal regulations than larger businesses. It is vital that we work to create an environment that allows startup businesses, small businesses and family farms to grow here in upstate New York and across the county. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. True economic growth begins by cutting costly regulations and allowing small businesses to flourish.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepClaudiaTenney/photos/a.185292125279586.1073741828.183020072173458/189327014876097/?type=3",NA,8,3,1,0,0,0,0,0

Obamacare has failed to deliver on the promises made to the American people and it must go.  Americans were promised they could keep their doctor and insurance if they chose to do so. That has been proven to be false. Millions of Americans are being denied the high-quality, patient-centered care they deserve. Under Obamacare, the quality of care has deteriorated, while the cost of services has skyrocketed for average consumers who have less choice and less freedom because of this law.  The House vote today signals to the American people that the Republican Congress will make good on its promise to repeal-and-replace Obamacare with a high-quality and truly affordable healthcare policy for all Americans.  In New York state, premiums are scheduled to rise again in 2017 by an average of 16.6 percent. That is on top of an average premium rise of 10.4% in 2016. The healthcare law has made good, quality insurance coverage unaffordable for my constituents and millions of hard-working families across the state and country.  Over 20 million individuals have felt this pinch and chosen to pay the tax penalty instead of purchasing the insurance available under this law. At the same time, major insurance companies are fleeing the exchanges, limiting the coverage choices available to Americans.  The small businesses, family farms, seniors, doctors and patients across Central New York and the Southern Tier deserve, and will get, better healthcare at more affordable rates than what is allowed under this law. I look forward to ensuring that happens as soon as possible.","status",NA,NA,37,107,21,1,1,0,6,50

Res 38, disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Interior (DOI) known as the Stream Protection Rule.  The Stream Protection Rule, introduced during the Obama Administration, attempted to alter the already existing regulations under the Stream Buffer Zone rule. However, due to the of lack of transparency in the 7-year rewrite, which cost taxpayers nearly $10 million, the rule ended up being duplicative and a one-size fits all approach. The process also failed to involve input from states, who regulate 97% of coal mines. Reports issued by the DOI confirm that nearly all coal mines operate under safe conditions, have no off-site impacts and are being restored responsibly and successfully.  It is imperative that Congress is involved in the issuing of new regulations, as bureaucrats in federal agencies often fail to consider how these actions will affect the average American. The Stream Protection rule would cause the loss of a third of all coal mining jobs throughout the United States and reduce coal production in 22 states, leading to increased energy costs and a large burden on hardworking Americans.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepClaudiaTenney/photos/a.185292125279586.1073741828.183020072173458/203195616822570/?type=3",NA,30,89,9,0,0,0,1,46

The first resolution, H.J.Res. 40, overturns a rule by the Social Security Administration (SSA) that jeopardizes the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. The rule, which was published in December 2016, would require the SSA to report individuals who receive disability benefits and who are deemed incapable of managing their own finances to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. This rule could potentially strip individuals of their right to keep and bear arms without adequate due process. This legislation was agreed to by a bipartisan vote of 235-180.  The second resolution, H.J.Res. 37, prohibits a rule from going into effect that would require companies bidding on federal contracts to disclose alleged labor law violations before they are fairly adjudicated. While well-intentioned, the rule would require companies to disclose alleged violations before they are even disputed in court, thereby blacklisting companies who are bidding on contracts without providing them any due process on the front end. This rule was blocked by a U.S. District Court for its lack of due process provisions. Further, existing regulations already prevent companies with poor labor records from competing for federal contracts.

Founded in 1974, Foxconn has grown to become the largest contract electronics manufacturer in the world.  The City of Utica has an abundance of wide-ranging resources and the necessary infrastructure critical to supporting the success and longevity of a manufacturing firm. Utica also has a premier greenfield site ready for immediate development. More than $40 million has been invested by both state and local agencies to ensure that this site is capable of sustaining a large manufacturing facility, like Foxconn.  Our community has an existing skilled workforce due to the large number of manufacturing facilities that have called Utica home. Also located in the surrounding region, are 26 universities, colleges and technical schools that offer engineering and technician training programs to meet the needs of high-tech manufacturing industries. These institutions are committed to seeing both their students and our community succeed. Therefore, Foxconn has the unique potential to partner with these local institutions to develop programs that will cultivate and sustain a well-trained workforce to fit their needs.  I urge Foxconn to consider the City of Utica for their expansion needs, and I invite Chairman Terry Gou to visit the City of Utica to view all that our great community has to offer.

This bill modifies the terms of a land exchange first authorized in 2009 between the Forest Service and Mount Hood Meadows ski area in Oregon by reducing the amount of land the Forest Service can convey to the ski area from 120 acres to 107 acres, setting deadlines for specific actions and modifying the mandated easements. Under the measure, the two parties must select an appraiser to appraise the land within 120 days of enactment. This bill was passed by a bipartisan vote of 415-1.  I also voted for H.R. 863, to facilitate the addition of a park administration site at the Coltsville National Historical Park. This bill modifies the original requirement that 10,000 square feet of space in the East Armory of the Coltsville National Historical Park be provided for park administration and visitors services, instead allowing the National Park Service to select an alternative location that they have already identified for these services within the Colt complex.

This bill establishes a 9-member commission, the Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission, which will identify federal regulations that should be repealed in order to lower the cost of regulations. The commission is required to submit an annual report to Congress that details its activities for the year and lists recommendations for repealing regulations. Ultimately, Congress is given the final say in cutting these regulations through an up or down vote. This bill was passed by a bipartisan vote of 240-185.  I also voted for H.J. Res. 83, Disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to ""Clarification of Employer’s Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury and Illness."" This legislation overturns a recent Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rule that extended the period for which an employer can be cited for failing to make and maintain a record of workplace injury or illness from six months to five years. This rule places a burden on small businesses and exceeds the authority granted to OSHA by Congress under law. When Washington employs top down regulatory schemes, it is our small businesses that are left to deal with the fallout. This bill was passed by a vote of 231-191.  Additionally, I voted for H.R. 1009, the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act. This act codifies the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, first established by President Bill Clinton, into statute. The bill grants OIRA review authority, which cannot be rescinded or limited by future presidencies. The Act enshrines OIRA as the first line of defense against excessive and onerous regulations and allows OIRA to ensure the consistency of regulations. OIRA review of rules and regulations will protect against duplicative rules before they are enacted. This bill was passed by a bipartisan vote of 241-184.","status",NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The news today that Remington laid-off 122 employees is truly unfortunate for our community and the hardworking families of Herkimer County. Economic downturns in the firearms industry coupled with a decrease in sales have forced Remington to reduce staff to remain competitive.

However, I will work tirelessly in Congress to roll back burdensome regulations that prevent businesses like Remington from growing.  Throughout my time in public service, it has been a distinct honor to work closely alongside the employees of Remington Arms to advocate for their needs in an effort to keep jobs in Ilion.

In 2015, VA employees received more than 177 million dollars in bonuses, which was 24 percent more than they received in 2014. The average bonus for a senior executive was ten thousand dollars.   I have no doubt that the men and women of the VA serve our veterans admirably each day. In my own district, I have spoken with veterans who are grateful for the compassionate care they receive from local VA clinics throughout Upstate New York. VA employees should be fairly compensated for their work and awarded for their achievement.   It is also clear to me that there is more work to be done. Just this month, an audit of several VA facilities in North Carolina and Virginia revealed that wait times continue to be misrepresented and that nearly 14,000 veterans were denied access to timely care. The audit also found that veterans were waiting an average of 26 days to see mental health specialists, while the VA falsely reported average wait times of six days.   In light of this information, the American people are right to wonder who at the VA may be receiving a bonus this year.   My amendment adds a simple reporting requirement to the bill that will streamline oversight of bonuses at the VA by requiring the agency to proactively provide information to Congress that details the amount of each bonus awarded to senior executives as well as the job titles of the individuals and the location of their employment.","video","https://youtu.be/lBitWrXFhV8",NA,29,26,2,1,0,0,0,0

This bill addresses issues of transparency and partiality that currently plague the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Specifically, this bill would improve the selection process for membership on the EPA’s Science Advisory Board (SAB). The bill would also require the SAB to publicly release the scientific determinations used to inform its advisories to EPA, and the public would be allowed to file open remarks on these determinations.  Currently, there are no guidelines to the SAB membership selection process and there are strong concerns over the exclusion of advisors from states, localities, and the private sector. Additionally, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service released a report in which it showed that since 2000, almost 60 percent of the membership of the SAB’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee have been the direct recipients of grants from the agency. H.R. 1431 addresses the serious issues that the Science Advisory Board faces by broadening membership and expanding opportunities for public commenting.   This legislation was agreed to by a bipartisan vote of 229-193.","status",NA,NA,20,43,1,1,0,1,0,46

Res. 92, which condemns North Korea’s development of multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles.  This resolution condemns North Korea’s continued development of ballistic missiles and calls for the timely deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea. THAAD will provide South Korea with the capability to respond to a potential North Korean strike.   North Korea’s continued provocation in the region is inexcusable. Last year, the country conducted two illegal nuclear tests and is on target to conduct even more this year. As the country continues to flout international laws and pursue an illicit missile program, we must work actively to constrain its capabilities and support our allies in the region.   This resolution was adopted by a bipartisan vote of 398-3.     I voted “Yes” on H.R. 479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act.   This legislation expresses the sense of Congress that North Korea meets the criteria to warrant a designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. It further requires the Secretary of State to submit a report to Congress within 90 days determining whether this is the case.   For two decades, North Korea was rightly designated as a state sponsor of terrorism for its actions in support of terrorist organizations around the world. However, in 2008, the Obama Administration removed this designation as a result of commitments made by North Korea to roll back its nuclear weapons program. As our intelligence agencies and North Korea’s own tests have confirmed, this has not happened and North Korea continues to aggressively pursue nuclear arms and fan the flames of international terror. As a result, there is little doubt that the country should once again be designated as a state sponsor of terror.

Dynamics in the Middle East continue to change, as such it is critical that our Congressional leaders have a firsthand perspective of the events unfolding.  In Lebanon, our delegation met with the Minister of Education and toured local schools to discuss the impact of the Syrian refugee population on the local schools and the work they are doing to accommodate the students. Our delegation also met with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri to discuss efforts to maintain stability and the ways the US is supporting this effort.   While in Lebanon, we also had the opportunity to visit the Marine Memorial to pay homage to service members who were killed in  the Beirut barracks bombing in 1983.  In Egypt, we met with President Al-Sisi and spoke about strengthening the relationship between our two countries in order to confront the threat of ISIS.   In Jordan, we met with Prime Minister Hani Al-Mulki to speak about the ways our countries can work together and further enhance our relationship. Through our talks, we gained valuable insight into regional challenges facing Jordan.   As we traveled through the region, we stopped at a number of refugee camps, including a camp in Jordan that housed 50,000 refugees. It was enlightening to speak directly with the refugees about the complex situation left by the war in their home country.

Lowering tax rates will provide much needed relief while encouraging economic growth and job creation throughout the entire nation.   However, although I agree with many aspects of the President’s plan, I cannot support repealing itemized deductions for state and local tax payments.

Instead, Americans have seen the worst economic recovery since World War II. Onerous red tape and rules promulgated by Dodd-Frank have made it increasingly difficult for our businesses to survive, causing our region to fall behind.   Excessive, complex regulations have led to the near extinction of community lending institutions in the 22nd District, which leaves our small businesses with less access to credit and a decreased ability to grow and create jobs. According to the Department of Labor, New York ranked 44th out of 50 for wages in 2015.In two major counties in the 22nd District, our unemployment rate exceeds 7 percent, well above the national average. Empowering our job creators and hardworking Americans begins with an economy that is built from Main Street up, not Wall Street down.  As for big bank bailouts, Dodd-Frank encourages Wall Street’s risky-behavior by enshrining taxpayer funded bailouts. The Financial CHOICE Act lays the ground work for a stable financial system by requiring financial institutions to be strongly capitalized so that taxpayers are no longer on the hook to fund big bank bailouts.   It also holds both Wall Street and Washington accountable by imposing the toughest penalties in history for those who commit financial fraud.

This bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to establish rules that provide a safe harbor for investment research reports related to exchange traded funds (ETFs). The SEC would have 270 days to enact the final rule.       Although safe harbors currently exist for investment research reports related to emerging growth company securities, the same protections do not apply to open-ended funds or ETFs.

Of these, 18 states mandate counties to contribute to the non-federal share of Medicaid costs and/or administrative, program, physical health and behavioral health costs.    If other states can provide high-quality healthcare to vulnerable citizens without taking advantage of local taxpayers, then so too can New York.   This amendment would count any funds that New York puts on its counties as “excess expenditures,” and would result in the state not getting reimbursed for such amounts.  For the first time in generations, this would incentivize New York to remove this burden and finally take responsibility for their Medicaid costs like every other state.  With a $163 billion budget with hundreds of millions set aside for cronyist projects and failed economic schemes, I am confident that the State Legislature and Governor can find ways to manage it's federally required Medicaid share instead of forcing the costs down to our counties and property tax payers.  http://www.cnyhomepage.com/news/video/claudia-tenney-discusses-medicaid_20170511220541/711936291","link","http://www.cnyhomepage.com/news/video/claudia-tenney-discusses-medicaid_20170511220541/711936291","cnyhomepage.com",31,42,6,0,3,0,1,21

Human trafficking is a horrific crime against humanity, impacting millions of men, women and children across the globe each year, and it is tragic to know that fellow human beings are being bought and sold right here in the United States.   As a multi-billion dollar industry, traffickers will employ extreme measures to exploit the most vulnerable in our society.

With these important pieces of legislation, we will work to hold traffickers accountable and ensure justice is realized for the victims of this modern-day form of slavery.  Throughout my time in the New York State Assembly, I championed measures that would provide protections for victims of human trafficking.   Working across party lines, I helped to pass the Trafficking Victims Protection and Justice Act. This bill, which I was an original cosponsor of, passed the New York State Assembly in 2015.

The sexual abuse or exploitation of minors is reprehensible in any circumstance and must be punished to the full extent of the law.

Claudia Tenney","2017-05-24","2017-05-24 13:19:59","I came to Washington with the mission to reform our federal government and eliminate wasteful Washington spending and this remains my goal. Decades of bloated budgets and a lack of fiscal accountability are why our country is inching closer to a debt of nearly $20 trillion.  However, my commitment to government reform does not change the fact that I represent a region of the country that has been left behind for too long and continues to experience slow economic growth. While reviewing the President’s proposed budget, I came across a number of proposed cuts that would be detrimental to rural communities across the 22nd District. A large number of my constituents depend on many of the programs the President wants to eliminate, and pulling the rug out from under them would be detrimental to our most vulnerable citizens.  Ultimately, Congress controls the power of the purse and has final say over what is included or what is cut in the budget. As such, I will continue to fight to ensure that funding for programs that constituents in the 22nd District rely on are included in the final budget”  The proposed cuts include:  -Community Development Block Grants: The budget proposal would eliminate the Community Development Block Grant program. I initially voiced concerns about these cuts earlier in the year. Cities in the 22nd district including Rome, Utica, and Binghamton all heavily rely on Community Development Block Grants.  -Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program: The budget proposes $428 million in cuts to this program, which provides assistant to rural communities for clean drinking water systems, sanitary solid waste disposal, storm water drainage, among others.  -21st Century Community Learning Program: The budget proposes eliminating this program altogether. Today, the 21st Century Community Learning Program provides enriching academic experiences for students throughout the country, including in New York’s 22nd district.    -Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG): The budget proposes eliminating this program altogether. FSEOG is a grant for undergraduate students who have exceptional financial need. Many of the colleges and universities in the 22nd district rely on this program. This year, I led a letter to House leaders requesting that funding for campus-based aid programs like FSEOG be protected.  -Cuts to Federal Work Study Program: The bill proposes cutting the Federal Work Study Program by half. Colleges, universities, and students benefit from the FWS program and while it could be reformed, significantly reducing it could have serious negative impacts.  -TRIO Programs: The budget proposes a $90 million cut to TRIO programs, which are Federal outreach and student services programs designed to identify and provide services for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. As a member of the TRIO Caucus in Congress, I understand the important role this program plays in communities throughout the district.  -LIHEAP: The budget proposes eliminating LIHEAP altogether, which would amount to a $3.384 billion cut. This program helps keep families safe and healthy through initiatives that assist families with energy costs. New York is a large recipient of LIHEAP assistance.  -Legal Services Corporation: The budget proposes a $351 million cut to the Legal Services Corporation, which effectively guts the program. LSC is the single largest funder of civil legal aid for low-income Americans and supports many programs in upstate New York.I previously expressed concerns with these proposed cuts and signed a letter in defense of this important program earlier in the year.  -Rural Economic Development Program: The budget would eliminate this program. The Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant program provides funding for rural projects through local utility organizations.","status",NA,NA,47,65,9,7,1,1,0,1

Read more about it in the article below.  Amendment Won Tenney's Support Of AHCA  SYRACUSE (WRVO) - Congresswoman Claudia Tenney’s (NY-22) yes vote on the American Health Care Act came down to the last minute. The deciding factor was an issue she has been intimately involved in.  For Tenney,  the decision to vote for the controversial American Health Care Act, came down to something that she pushed in her other legislative life as a state assembly member:  ""My favorite part of the bill is the amendment that I fought for, that I actually sponsored and co-sponsored, one that I fought for with the Democrat Amy Paulin,  and numerous other Assembly members, including our own Anthony Brindisi, which would take the local share of Medicaid and give it back to the state,” Tenney said.  New York’s relies heavily on counties to pay it’s Medicaid bill, more than any other state. It is also one of the most generous Medicaid programs in the country, covering low income individuals, a large number of nursing home residents and  half of the state’s disabled population.    The Medicaid Mandate Relief Amendment approved with the AHCA, would prohibit states from passing Medicaid costs to counties. Tenney said shifting spending back to Albany, will have a huge impact on local governments which could then lower taxes.  ""You would help the small business community, especially farmers who are large landowners.  You would help bring people back into this community.  It would be fantastic,"" Tenney explained. ""And you would force New York State to finally deal with this Medicaid issue.”  Tenney said this would be the first real tax relief in a generation for Upstate property taxpayers, who pay among the highest taxes in the nation.  As for the rest of the bill, she admits it’s not perfect, and expects it will be improved as the legislative process moves forward.  http://wskgnews.org/post/amendment-won-tenneys-support-ahca#stream/0","link","http://wskgnews.org/post/amendment-won-tenneys-support-ahca#stream/0","skgnews.org",37,83,9,1,4,0,0,41

Brad Schneider in introducing a bipartisan Resolution Condemning Sexual Abuse and Exploitation by UN Peacekeepers.  Over the past decade, allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation launched against UN peacekeepers have become increasingly frequent. Although this is not the norm, a recent AP report found that over the last 12 years, an estimated 2,000 allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation have been made against UN peacekeepers. Many allegations have gone uninvestigated or unaddressed and often involve women and children displaced by conflict or whom are otherwise vulnerable.  The resolution reaffirms our country’s commitment to ensuring that this issue is addressed and directs the Administration to redouble its pressure and focus on efforts toward reform within the United Nations.  It also calls on the Administration to establish a clear and meaningful policy to hold troop-contributing countries accountable for allegations of abuse and to assist the UN in providing victims the justice they deserve, particularly by improving the vetting and training of peacekeepers, and by improving investigations to bring greater credibility to the process.  http://romesentinel.com/county/tenney-resolution-condemns-sexual-abuse-by-u-n-forces/QBqqey!ATY5tWeQ4Qs3VMYJsFrZw/","link","http://romesentinel.com/county/tenney-resolution-condemns-sexual-abuse-by-u-n-forces/QBqqey!ATY5tWeQ4Qs3VMYJsFrZw/","romesentinel.com",16,13,4,0,0,0,0,0

These two conflicts were critical in changing the course of World War II in favor of the Allies. On this day, the men of the Allied forces led by General Eisenhower took part in the largest seaborne invasion in history. Their mission was to liberate Europe from the scourge of the Nazis.   Landing on beaches and parachuting from planes, they faced innumerable odds with an entrenched enemy, towering cliffs, and flooded out fields. Yet the Allies emerged victorious and D-Day served as the catalyst to the liberation of Europe in less than a year later.  Two years prior, on the other side of the world, another important conflict took place, the Battle of Midway. Six months after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, in what would be one of the most decisive battles in naval history, the U.S. was able to ambush and destroy four Japanese aircraft carriers. Led by Admiral Nimitz, the Navy succeeded in this conflict which turned the tide for the U.S. in the Pacific theater.

Brad Schneider (D-IL) in introducing a new bipartisan piece of legislation that will strengthen the processes that ensures Israel’s qualitative military edge (QME) over regional adversaries.  The Defending Israel’s QME Act of 2017, or H.R. 2833, expands the United States’ coordination with our strongest regional ally by requiring the President to consult with appropriate officials in the government of Israel on Israel’s QME before authorizing arms sales to countries in the Middle East.  The bill also enhances previous QME requirements with new assessments, including ensuring Israel may effectively defend itself against non-state actors and considering the risk posed if the weapons fell into unauthorized hands.  With the conflict in Syria, uncertainty regarding Iran, and the growth of ISIS, Israel faces more threats than ever and from all sides. At the same time, the country remains the region’s great democracy and our longstanding ally.   This bill reaffirms our commitment to Israel’s security by raising the bar for future military sales to other actors in the region. This will ensure that our strategic support of other countries does not have the inadvertent effect of degrading Israel’s Qualitative Military Edge, which both Democrats and Republicans agree must be preserved.  This bill comes as Congress considers approval of a possible $350 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia proposed by the Administration. Leaders in the United States and Israel have expressed concern that the deal may lead to the diminishment of Israel’s QME.  tenney.house.gov/media/press-releases/reps-tenney-and-schneider-introduce-bipartisan-bill-defend-israel-s-military","link","http://tenney.house.gov/media/press-releases/reps-tenney-and-schneider-introduce-bipartisan-bill-defend-israel-s-military","tenney.house.gov",13,8,2,3,0,0,0,12

Families and small business owners in Oswego County and the Lake Ontario region have had their properties devastated by recent flooding. During a recent tour of the area, I had the chance to see the severity of the damage first hand. It is unthinkable that Governor Cuomo would deprive these property owners of the relief they desperately need. Both the State Senate and Assembly unanimously passed this bill, if the Governor refuses to sign it into law then that is a failure of leadership on his part. Upstate New Yorkers have been burdened long enough under Cuomo’s watch, it’s time that the families in the Lake Ontario region receive the relief they need.  The bill was introduced by Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Morelle, and Sen. Pam Helming and on Monday was approved unanimously by the New York State Legislature. Grants were due to provide $15 million for homeowners, $25 million for businesses, $25 million for local municipalities, $15 million for flood mitigation and $10 million for additional disaster relief.  Individual grants would be capped at $60,000 for individual homeowners, $100,000 for small businesses and farms and $1 million for municipalities.

He served in the European and American Theaters, and participated in the invasion of Normandy on D-Day.  John C. Ford grew up on a farm in Waterville with twenty-three siblings. Following the death of his father, John, his mother and 4 siblings moved to Cornhill in Utica during the great depression where he attended Utica Free Academy as part of the Class of 1939.    In 1943, John joined the Army where he served as a Sargent in the 203 Medical Evacuation Hospital.    After the war, John attended Syracuse University under the GI Bill and graduated with a Master’s Degree in Business Administration.   Soon after, he opened a tavern in Rome called the Green Gate. After closing the tavern at night, John would frequently go to Eddies Landmark diner where he met Assunda George, one of the waitresses. John and Assunda later married in 1952, and from that day, never left each other’s side. Together they had six children whom all went on to graduate from college.  After John sold the tavern and he took a position with a new college in Utica’s Oneida Square— the beginning of Utica College. There he worked as the Coordinator of Veterans Affairs. In his 42 years at Utica College, John worked as the bursar, comptroller and finally Vice President, retiring in 1994.    Our office had the honor of recovering a number of medals, including the Good Conduct Medal, American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with two bronze service stars, World War II Victory Medal, Honorable Service Lapel Button-World War II also known as the Ruptured Duck.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepClaudiaTenney/photos/a.185292125279586.1073741828.183020072173458/278744102601054/?type=3",NA,29,2,2,2,0,0,0,0

In 2016, the Obama Administration approved Plan 2014, which has been a major contributor in increasing the frequency of raising and lowering the water levels in Lake Ontario. The fluctuation in water levels has increased erosion damage to the Lake’s south shoreline including the lakeshore properties of businesses and homeowners.  According to the IJC’s own studies, this plan would raise water levels by a maximum of 2.4 inches, therefore increasing the annual cost of shoreline maintenance and protections by 13 percent.  Property owners in the Lake Ontario region have been devastated by recent flooding along the shoreline, and if left unaddressed the high water levels will continue to cause severe damage. The effects of IJC’s Plan 2014 have been a major contributor in jeopardizing homes and businesses, and it is imperative that the IJC help mitigate costs to shoreline property owners by covering flooding damages with a portion of their budget. The IJC must do their part to protect shoreline property owners from the expected impact of these actions.  Counties in the U.S. bear a disproportionate amount of the risk, with damages in the eight counties touching Lake Ontario projected to make up 69.1 percent of total damage.  https://tenney.house.gov/media/press-releases/congresswoman-claudia-tenney-requests-compensation-property-owners-impacted","link","https://tenney.house.gov/media/press-releases/congresswoman-claudia-tenney-requests-compensation-property-owners-impacted","tenney.house.gov",17,10,1,0,0,0,0,1

The SALT deduction, which has been a part of the U.S. tax code since 1913, allows New Yorkers, as well as taxpayers across the nation, to write off their state and local income tax from their federal returns to prevent double taxation.  Reforming our tax code is vitally important and remains among my top priorities. As a small business owner and resident of nearly the highest taxed state in the nation, I have seen firsthand the devastation caused to our region by the complex, unfair tax code.   In New York, soaring taxes have driven businesses and residents out of our state in record numbers, crippling our local economies. Lowering tax rates will provide much needed relief while encouraging economic growth and job creation throughout the entire nation.   However, until New York completely overhauls its tax code, eliminating the SALT deduction will strip hardworking New Yorkers of their only real tax relief. I will continue to fight for comprehensive tax reform while working to ensure that New Yorkers are not unfairly burdened by any change to the tax code.  tenney.house.gov/media/press-releases/tenney-fights-protect-state-and-local-tax-deduction-hardworking-new-yorkers","link","http://tenney.house.gov/media/press-releases/tenney-fights-protect-state-and-local-tax-deduction-hardworking-new-yorkers","tenney.house.gov",29,12,1,0,0,0,0,0

The project must comply with existing federal law and protections.   This legislation was agreed to by a vote of 424-1.   I voted “Yes” on H.Res. 397, which reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s principle of collective defense as enumerated in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.   This resolution reaffirms the collective defense provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and expresses strong support for NATO’s core mission of maintaining peace and security throughout Europe. It further calls on all NATO countries to meet their 2 percent gross domestic product commitment to defense by 2024.   This legislation was agreed to by a vote of 434-4.","status",NA,NA,6,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Claudia Tenney","2017-07-04","2017-07-04 16:21:24","As we take time this weekend to celebrate our nation’s 241st birthday, we pause to recognize the great ideals that our nation has stood for since its founding--freedom, liberty, independence and individual rights. It is a day where we as Americans look to the future as we continue our great experiment, while reflecting on the sacrifices it took to get here.  In 1776, the Continental Congress gathered in Independence Hall in Philadelphia. There they would author perhaps one of the most profound documents in the history of mankind. Together, our founders set out to create a new nation, one conceived in liberty, where individual rights were to be absolute and where freedom would reign supreme. These men believed that government was instituted by people, and that it derived its just powers from the consent of the governed.  On July 4th, 1776 these ideals became a reality with the creation of the United States of America. In an extraordinary act of bravery and patriotism, fifty-six men signed the Declaration of Independence.  Our founding fathers knew of the great challenges before them. In the midst of a war against the most powerful military in the world, the United States endured a long and arduous conflict to keep a fledging nation alive. One that took part throughout the thirteen colonies with pivotal battles the Battle of Oriskany and the Siege of Fort Stanwix fought right here in upstate New York. The United States went on to win the Revolutionary War, establishing itself as an independent nation and free society for centuries to come.  Today, we think of these decisive moments in our nation’s history and thank the brave members of the United States Armed Forces who fought for us, for the American idea. Who, despite incredible odds, stood strong in our quest to uphold the beliefs of our founding fathers. As the mother of an active duty U.S Marine, I know all too well that the service and sacrifice of these men is a debt that can never be repaid.  Throughout our nation’s history we have dealt with challenges both foreign and domestic, yet as Americans we continue to persevere. We stand together in our common patriotism, a deep love for our country and all it stands for. We remember our nation’s journey, and remember that despite our differences, we are unified as Americans. Our nation is a city upon a hill, in which the eyes of the world are upon us.  On this Fourth of July we celebrate our great nation and all that we have accomplished over these 241 years. We celebrate the bravery of our founders, for in 1776, despite venturing into uncharted territory, the United States began its journey as the first nation to declare its independence.  So, the next time you see our flag gallantly waving in the breeze, remember these wise words by Thomas Jefferson, “the cement of this union is the heart-blood of every American.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepClaudiaTenney/photos/a.185292125279586.1073741828.183020072173458/283713068770824/?type=3",NA,35,9,3,5,0,0,0,0

Residents are frustrated by the increasing frequency of the flooding and while the state has stepped up their mitigation efforts, we must do better to manage these waterways. It is important that the DEC and other state agencies work closely with communities to implement more sustainable and effective flood mitigation programs moving forward. I have been actively involved in this issue as a state official in the New York State Assembly.  I continue to remain concerned about the DEC’s interpretation of Article 15 regulations concerning the state’s streams and waterways.

Claudia Tenney","2017-07-08","2017-07-08 00:42:26","I spent this afternoon visiting properties on Sauquoit Street in Whitesboro that were badly damaged during the flooding.   First, I met with Karen Hughes who owns three properties that were damaged in the flood. Karen has lived in the same home for over 60 years and said that she has seen flooding like this occur with increasing frequency over the past few years.  After the most recent flooding, Karen told us that she feels as if shouldn't remain in her home because she will live in constant fear that this could happen to her all over again. Years of Karen's memories were destroyed, and the clean up process will likely continue for weeks.   I also met with one of Karen's tenants whose home was completely destroyed. The tenant was devastated as he now has to worry about finding a new home for himself and his pets.  Next, I visited a Whitesboro resident whose home was completely destroyed. He is now homeless and has slept outside for the last few days.  After that, we met with homeowner who had just renovated his basement and fixed his home after Sandy damaged it back in 2013.  He told us couldn't imagine anything worse than Sandy, but he said that in over 30 years of living in the same home that this flood was by far the worst he has seen.  His entire basement is now gone, and his backyard had 3.5 feet of water in it. He told us that he can't, and won't, keep putting money into his home as it keeps getting damaged from flooding.   I also stopped in Chadwicks where I met with the Diefenbacher family along their neighbors and a number of people who stopped their cars to share their stories. Their homes along the creek had their basements and porches destroyed.   Then, we visited Irena Tomaszewski who fled communist Soviet Union Poland to come to the U.S. and start a business. Sadly, her dry cleaning business in Whitestown was destroyed in the flood. Irena immigrated from Poland in 1981 and started her business from the ground up in 1986. She has 3 children and 5 grandchildren, this business is her only source of income. It was damaged in the 2013 flood and since then she has been pleading with the state to better manage the waterways in her area.  Throughout the past week, I have heard countless tragic and heartbreaking stories like the ones I just mentioned from residents who have had their homes and memories ripped away from them. As a victim of flooding, I know all too well how personal a flood is. Structural damage takes years to recover from and destroyed personal belongings and memories are irreplaceable.   As your representative, I'll continue to fight to ensure that all impacted by the flood get the help they deserve and need. I've called on Governor Cuomo to assess the damage to request a federal disaster declaration and I'll continue to call upon FEMA to step up, do its job and help our struggling property owners across our region.   I also know that residents are frustrated by the increasing frequency of the flooding and while the state has stepped up their mitigation efforts, we must do better to manage these waterways.   It is important that the DEC and other state agencies work closely with communities to implement more sustainable and effective flood mitigation programs moving forward.

Claudia Tenney","2017-07-12","2017-07-12 20:27:12","This week, I introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018 that would restore the Berry Amendment’s longstanding domestic sourcing requirement for stainless steel flatware. Sherrill Manufacturing, located in the 22nd District, is the only domestic flatware manufacturer currently in operation.  Reinstating the Berry Amendment’s three-decades old domestic sourcing provision for stainless steel flatware will provide our service members with high-quality domestic flatware while allowing local manufacturers and small businesses across the U.S. to thrive. As the only flatware manufacturer made 100 percent in America, Sherrill Manufacturing has proven their commitment to our nation and our community time and again.  American taxpayers overwhelmingly support having their hard-earned tax dollars go to American companies, so long as doing so does not raise the costs of business or unnecessarily burden government operations. The amendment I introduced will help support American manufacturing, while protecting and growing jobs right here at home.  http://www.oneidadispatch.com/general-news/20170712/tenney-wants-sherrill-flatware-on-military-tables","link","http://www.oneidadispatch.com/general-news/20170712/tenney-wants-sherrill-flatware-on-military-tables","oneidadispatch.com",35,17,3,4,0,0,1,0

In order for President Trump to issue a disaster declaration, federal law requires that the initial request come from the governor.   On July 6, 2017, Governor Cuomo officially requested that a major disaster declaration be issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.   Due to the severity of this flooding and persistently high water levels, Governor Cuomo determined that the scope of the relief and response efforts are beyond the capability of the state.  In a bipartisan letter, the Representatives cited record high water levels in Lake Ontario and the unprecedented flooding that has had a severe and damaging impact across the eight-county region.   Municipalities have struggled to keep up with the costs of repairs for critical infrastructure and without federal support, they will continue to struggle to safeguard and repair existing infrastructure and mitigate against future flooding.  https://tenney.house.gov/media/press-releases/reps-tenney-collins-stefanik-slaughter-and-katko-urge-trump-issue-disaster","link","https://tenney.house.gov/media/press-releases/reps-tenney-collins-stefanik-slaughter-and-katko-urge-trump-issue-disaster","tenney.house.gov",29,26,2,0,0,0,0,0

Increasing oversight will help to ensure that our veterans, who have made the selfless sacrifice to serve our nation, receive the highest quality of care possible. I have no doubt that the men and women of the VA serve our veterans admirably each day. In fact, I know that many of them do. In my own district, I have spoken with veterans who are grateful for the compassionate care they receive from the VA Hospital in Syracuse as well as local VA clinics in Binghamton and Rome.

Upstate has a rich history of manufacturing products used around the world. Bad policies passed down from Albany have driven people and businesses out of our state in record numbers, leading our region to become the rustbelt of New York.   Albany politicians have made our state among the highest taxed and regulated state in the nation garnering the title of the least friendly business climate in the country. Despite Albany’s attack on the Upstate economy, on the federal and local level, we are working to rebuild our beautiful state to bring jobs and businesses back to our community.  I have full confidence that President Trump understands the struggle that upstate New York has experienced for decades, and why we need to continue to fight for policies that will revive our region. Just last week, I had the honor of attending a Made in America event at the White House with President Trump.  The President praised the hard work and ingenuity of the founders of Sherrill Manufacturing for reviving the only flatware manufacturer in the nation with a brand appropriately known as Liberty Tabletop.   Instead of urging people to leave our region, we should be working to implement policies that help small business owners and family farmers to draw people and jobs back to our region.   Today, I renew my invitation for the President to visit our area and encourage him to come see the efforts we’re making to revive our once thriving economy.  http://www.timesunion.com/7day-business/article/Trump-says-upstate-New-Yorkers-should-move-leave-11437258.php","link","http://www.timesunion.com/7day-business/article/Trump-says-upstate-New-Yorkers-should-move-leave-11437258.php","timesunion.com",90,209,45,5,28,5,6,51

They highlighted the need for tax and regulatory reform, infrastructure upgrades and the high cost of energy.   In upstate New York, a number of problems have long had a direct bearing on the success and growth of the manufacturing industry in our region. One issue that came up repeatedly was the need for more skills training, which will increase the pool of qualified applicants that our local employers can tap into.   Expanding career and technical education must be a priority in Washington. Just recently, the House of Representatives passed the bipartisan Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, but we must do more to improve the skills and qualifications of our workforce.

The Family Health Network serves a large number of the neediest citizens across the 22nd Congressional District and throughout upstate New York. In Congress, I’ve fought to ensure that federally funded health care centers receive the resources they need to continue to provide excellent healthcare to those who need it the most. It is an honor to accept this award and to continue my work to secure important funding for the Family Health Network.  Throughout my time in Congress, I have been a strong supporter of Community Health Centers. Recently, I championed an effort to continue federal funding and support of federal Health Centers, which led to the inclusion of $1.5 billion in the House’s recommended fiscal year 2018 appropriations bill. This is nearly one billion more than in fiscal year 2017.   I also supported an appropriations request calling on House leaders to support a range of programs important to the health of rural communities, including a request to fully fund the Community Health Centers.   Additionally, I am a cosponsor of H.R. 1955, the Rural Hospital Access Act, which would permanently extend the Medicare-dependent hospitals and enhanced low-volume adjustment programs.  Family Health Network operates 11 locations around Cortland County and is one of four federally-funded health care centers organization in the 22nd Congressional District. Together, these four locations leverage nearly $10 million in federal funding and serve over 150,000 of the region’s neediest families and individuals.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepClaudiaTenney/photos/a.184550148687117.1073741827.183020072173458/303817566760374/?type=3",NA,11,4,1,0,1,0,0,0

Agriculture is among upstate New York’s most important industries and has for decades been a vital part of our region’s heritage. In recent years, unfair trade agreements, rising regulatory costs, and distortions in the labor market have made it more difficult for family farms to grow and thrive in the Mohawk Valley and Southern Tier.  I am working to protect Upstate agriculture, push back against bad trade deals, and fight federal overreach. I am a cosponsor of H.R. 281, the Family Farm Relief Act. This bill streamlines the H-2A Agricultural Visa program so that it works better for farmers who lack access to a stable and reliable labor pool. I also supported passage of H.R. 26, the REINS Act. This bill would require Congressional approval of significant agency regulations that have the potential to impact agriculture. I am also leading the charge to change and reform the Dairy Margin Protection Program so that it actually works for farmers who are paying into it.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepClaudiaTenney/photos/a.184550148687117.1073741827.183020072173458/307070846435046/?type=3",NA,26,12,4,0,0,0,0,0

Uncharacteristically high levels of rainfall along with severe flash flooding, strong winds, and tornadoes caused significant and costly damage to homes, infrastructure, and small businesses. Sustained flooding due to excessive rainfall has been especially damaging, with some localities having received rainfall amounts that exceeded 150 percent of normal precipitation levels. A significant portion of this damage, more than $14.4 million, occurred in New York’s 22nd District. In Oneida County alone, damage exceeded $7 million. Cleanup efforts will be costly for property owners and municipalities alike. A federal disaster declaration will help families and municipalities recover from this summer’s extreme weather and excessive flooding. The scope of damage is beyond the response capabilities of state and local governments, which warrants targeted federal recovery assistance.  Our office has been deeply involved with recovery efforts since the start of the flooding in early July. We have visited numerous homes and businesses, been in direct contact with more than 100 impacted residents and have passed several individual damage assessments along to FEMA and state officials.

This will ensure there are no gaps on the oversight board.   This bill was agreed to by a bipartisan vote of 407-1.  --  I voted “Yes” on H.R. 2864, the Improving Access to Capital Act.  Under this bill, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is directed to modify regulations in order to allow certain small public companies to issue securities. This bill will assist small businesses and was previously passed by the Financial Services Committee, on which I serve.   This bill was agreed to by a bipartisan vote of 403-3.","status",NA,NA,11,7,1,0,1,0,0,0

Claudia Tenney","2017-09-06","2017-09-06 16:00:32","Today, I introduced an amendment to restore funding to the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program by $10 million for Fiscal Year 2018.   President Trump’s budget proposed cutting funding to the CDBG program altogether. My amendment will add $10 million back into CDBG program funding in addition to the $2.9 billion in funding that the House has already proposed for the program.   I came to Washington with the mission to reform our federal government and eliminate wasteful Washington spending and this remains my goal. Decades of bloated budgets and a lack of fiscal accountability are why our country is inching closer to a debt of nearly $20 trillion.  However, my commitment to government reform does not change the fact that I represent a region of the country that has been left behind for too long and continues to experience slow economic growth. A large number of my constituents depend on many of the programs that have been put on the chopping block, including the CDBG program. Eliminating funding for this important resource would be detrimental to our most vulnerable citizens.   I will continue to fight to restore funding to the CDBG program until we see a thriving economy in our Upstate communities that have come to rely on this important program.  Funding provided by the CDBG program is used in primarily low- to moderate-income level communities throughout the country to finance a wide-range of community development needs including youth services, senior services, employment training and economic development, among a number of other programs.  I initially voiced concern about cuts to the CDBG program early this year. Following President Trump’s budget proposal in March, I again reiterated my concerns about cuts to the CDBG program.  In the 2018 Fiscal Year Appropriations Bill, the House Appropriations Committee proposed $2.9 billion in funding for CDBG grants, which is $100 million below last year’s funding.   My amendment will be up for a vote during the Appropriations process later this week.  tenney.house.gov/media/press-releases/congresswoman-claudia-tenney-fights-restore-cdbg-funding-upstate-new-york","link","http://tenney.house.gov/media/press-releases/congresswoman-claudia-tenney-fights-restore-cdbg-funding-upstate-new-york","tenney.house.gov",43,18,7,5,1,0,0,3

DFAS Rome handles the payment services of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and currently employs nearly 1,000 people, mostly civilians. Across the globe, DFAS has 12,000 employees. DFAS Rome employees assist DoD operations around the world, including the Middle East and Europe.  During my first visit to DFAS, I toured the facility, spoke with a number of employees and met with the site's director Chet Boutelle.  In the 22nd District, DFAS Rome is not only a vital employer in our community, but it also plays an important role in executing financial functions that support the day-to-day operations of the U.S. Army. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to see this important work firsthand. It's an honor to work with DFAS and continue to advocate for the needs of this important facility in Congress. The stronger DFAS Rome is, the stronger our military will be.  During the tour I learned that DFAS is leading the way in working to further the careers of their employees at the facility by putting a strong emphasis on the importance of education, including offering programs to aid recent college graduates seeking a job in accounting. I spoke with many employees who praised DFAS Rome's efforts to help further their education and increase opportunities for growth at the facility.  I also spoke with DFAS employees about the work I have done in Washington to advocate for their facility including: voting for an increase in military funding, teaming up with Senator Schumer to urge the DoD to exempt the DFAS and its Rome facility from any government-wide hiring freeze and defeating the AFMO process, which could potentially have transferred some DFAS work back the Army. I am is also fighting to ensure union representation on the newly established Defense Accounting Solutions Board, which is set to examine financial processes and procedures within DoD.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepClaudiaTenney/photos/a.184550148687117.1073741827.183020072173458/317356222073175/?type=3",NA,10,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

With the funding deadline fast approaching, we must prioritize the extension of the Community Health Centers Program.

In New York, soaring taxes have driven businesses and residents out of our state in record numbers, crippling our local economies.   However, as I’ve said from day one, eliminating the federal deduction for state and local taxes will unfairly burden the over 3 million hardworking taxpayers in New York who claim the deduction.

While the well-connected receive bailouts and kickbacks, small businesses see nothing but tax hikes and increased costs. Against this backdrop, it is harder than ever for Americans to find good-paying jobs that match their skills and for small businesses to grow and adapt to an ever-changing economy.  As a small business owner, I have seen firsthand how our tax code discourages American businesses from growing and hiring, especially our small businesses. Worse yet, our tax code is riddled with special interest loopholes that benefit the well-off at the expense of hardworking New Yorkers.  We cannot afford to continue down this unsustainable path.

Time and again, I’ve head heartbreaking stories from families who have lost their loved ones to this pernicious scourge.  Today, we again see another alarming number of lives lost from this tragic epidemic. District Attorney Steve Cornwall announced 55 drug-related overdose deaths throughout 2017 in Broome County alone.  We cannot stand by while this epidemic continues to ravage our communities, we must untie and work to provide the resources necessary to our law enforcement officers, communities and those suffering from an opioid addiction. Combatting this epidemic requires cooperation, understanding and diligence across all levels of government.    In Congress, I’ve worked across the aisle to provide greater resources to combat substance abuse, and voted to fund key programs including the Opioid Abuse Reduction Activities, Office of National Drug Control Policy, High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas and increased training and resources for our first responders. I have also cosponsored the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act and the Comprehensive Fentanyl Control Act, which aim to stop dangerous drugs from being sold and shipped across our borders.   However, Congress can and must do more to address this growing crisis. I’ll continue to fight for a comprehensive and caring solution to this end tragedy plaguing our communities.  http://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/public-safety/2017/10/02/drug-deaths-have-claimed-55-broome-county-residents-so-far-2017-da-says/722529001/","link","http://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/public-safety/2017/10/02/drug-deaths-have-claimed-55-broome-county-residents-so-far-2017-da-says/722529001/","pressconnects.com",16,30,4,0,0,1,8,4

This legislation will expand a pilot program to study the safety implications of allowing individuals between the ages of 18 and 21 to operate trucks across state lines. Under current federal law, individuals in this age group may obtain a commercial driver’s license (CDL) in each of the 48 contiguous states; however, they are prohibited from operating trucks across state lines.  We already allow qualified drivers between the ages of 18 and 21 to drive from Long Island to Buffalo without a problem, but prohibit them from crossing the George Washington Bridge from Fort Lee, New Jersey into New York City.   The WHEEL Act is a common sense measure that would ease the burden on these truck operators by sensibly expanding the interstate truck driving pilot program authorized by the FAST Act, while maintaining strong standards for participants.   The trucking industry moves most of our nation’s freight tonnage and is vital to the health of our economy. However, by 2024, estimates suggest that the shortage throughout the country could be as many as 175,000 unfilled driving positions. With a truck driving shortage that is only expected to grow more acute over time, we should take all reasonable steps to address the issue including passing the WHEEL Act.  The FAST Act, which Congress passed in 2016 with bipartisan support, created a pilot program to study the safety implications of allowing individuals between the ages of 18 and 21 to operate trucks across state lines. However, this pilot program has been limited by the strict requirements that participants be veterans or active duty between the ages of 18 and 21, a demographic that has been challenging to recruit in statistically significant numbers for the purposes of this study  Expanding this pilot program safely through the WHEEL Act will enable a larger pool of qualified individuals to participate and begin their career as a CDL operator earlier, helping to end the driver shortage facing the trucking industry.","status",NA,NA,30,25,1,0,0,0,0,3

The Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act imposes commonsense restricts on late term abortions to protect the most vulnerable in our society. Scientific evidence has shown that abortions are particularly painful for unborn children after 20 weeks. At 20 weeks, an unborn child is developed enough to respond to sound and feel pain.

Right now, the Rohingya people are suffering undue hardship and violence under a government that has failed to uphold the values inherent to a vibrant democracy.   It has been reported that an average of 2,000 Rohingya are fleeing the country each day. Denied basic rights for decades, the Rohingya people have been subject to systematic discrimination as a religious minority in a predominantly Buddhist country. The state has gone so far as to completely deny citizenship to the Rohingya people since 1982.   Serious accusations of ethnic-cleansing and genocide have been leveled against the government, which has failed to respond appropriately to calls for calm and peace.   While the government has the right to defend itself against any form of insurgency, common and agreed upon rules of warfare dictate that all civilians be protected. This rule is sacred and must not be broken.   Despite this, reports of abuse against civilians are running rampant in Myanmar. More than 200 villages have been destroyed, many burned to the ground by government forces. Communities are being wiped away as hundreds, possibly even thousands, of civilians are slaughtered.

From day one, I have fought against the elimination of the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), and will work to ensure the deduction is included in the final bill. Currently, 30 percent of taxpayers nationwide, and 62,530 in the 22nd District, claim this deduction making it one of the most widely used in the country.   Until New York completely overhauls and simplifies its tax code, eliminating the SALT deduction will strip primarily middle- and low-income New Yorkers of their only real tax relief.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act released today is an important first step to level the playing field for hardworking Upstate families and end loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected. With a simpler and fairer tax code, middle-income families and small businesses will have the opportunity to grow and thrive once again.  Importantly, this bill is only the start of the tax reform conversation. I will continue to advocate for robust SALT provisions that provide tangible relief to New York taxpayers, small businesses and family farmers. In a state like New York, where taxpayers are beholden to the unaccountable and fiscally irresponsible policies of liberal elites in Albany, the SALT deduction matters. It amounts to real relief for hardworking families.   This is why I continue to stand with many of my Republican colleagues from New York in advocating for the inclusion of meaningful SALT provisions in a final tax reform package. As a result of our strong efforts on behalf of New York taxpayers, we have already proven successful in retaining portions of the SALT deduction that will enable overburdened property tax payers in New York to continue deducting their property taxes. Moving forward, I will continue to put New York taxpayers first, just as I have always done.","status",NA,NA,62,103,5,8,6,0,0,56

The legislation repeals Obamacare’s Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), preventing unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats from making changes to Medicare spending with no Congressional oversight, potentially compromising access to health care for the nation’s senior citizens.  Medicare is a lifeline for New York seniors and we must do all we can protect and preserve this vital program. Ceding the future of Medicare to a small number of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats, as Obamacare required, is a deeply flawed approach.  Repealing Obamacare’s harmful IPAB is a step in the right direction that allows Congress to make decisions that expand choice, flexibility and competition in the Medicare program.

Claudia Tenney","2017-11-07","2017-11-07 14:24:07","The SALT deduction is New Yorkers’ only relief from Albany's bad habits and out-of-control spending.   Check out my op-ed in today's edition of the Wall Street Journal on why SALT matters to NYers:  ""Tax reform is the key to unlocking the American dream for millions of people. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, released last week, would raise the standard deduction for families from $12,700 to $24,000, increase the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $1,600, and cut the tax rate on workers with low and middle incomes.  Each of these provisions is aimed squarely at providing necessary and overdue relief. Today’s tax code is not only outdated and onerous, it favors the wealthy and well connected.  But I worry about the way this bill erodes the deduction for state and local taxes, which has been in place since 1913. Although the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would let Americans continue deducting up to $10,000 of property taxes, it would eliminate the deduction for state income taxes.  This would compound the already excruciating financial burden that my state’s lawmakers have placed on New Yorkers. Politicians in Albany have internalized the state motto, “ever upward,” and applied it to taxes, with little regard to what families and small businesses can afford. New York’s many taxes—income, property, sales and excise—are among the highest in the nation, and New York is often ranked the least tax- friendly state.  Albany has also increased the weight of local taxes by imposing one unfunded mandate after another on local governments. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the property taxes my constituents pay. A 2013 study from the Brookings Tax Policy Center ranked more than 3,000 counties by their ratio of property tax to home value. All eight of the counties I represent in upstate New York are in the top 36 nationwide. Cortland County comes in at No. 6 and Oswego County at No. 15. But these areas are far from wealthy. To the contrary, average family incomes are well below the national average. My constituents are struggling to pay for Albany’s litany of costly rules and regulations.  The ability to deduct state and local taxes on their federal return matters because these New Yorkers cannot count on Albany to protect them. While families are falling behind or leaving the state, spendthrift liberals in the capital continue to waste money on boondoggles like the Buffalo Billion, Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s costly effort to revitalize Western New York’s economy, which has so far led to nine federal corruption charges; Start-Up NY, the governor’s signature job-creation program, which has produced a tiny fraction of the jobs it promised despite a $53 million advertising budget; and “film tax credit” giveaways to Hollywood elites worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  Each year, taxpayers fund Mr. Cuomo’s economic-development and job-creation programs to the tune of nearly $8 billion. Although New York spends more than any other state on these programs, we have little to show in return except record out-migration of jobs and people. Much of this spending is corporate welfare designed to curry favor with Mr. Cuomo’s donor class at the expense of the taxpayers.  The bad habits in Albany won’t change. That’s why it’s vital to retain the SALT deduction, which for now will remain the taxpayers’ only source of significant relief.  Congress has a historic opportunity to pass a comprehensive tax reform that would truly level the playing field for American families and small businesses. Then the onus will be on Democrats in Albany to get on board, put taxpayers first, and make New York competitive again.""  https://www.wsj.com/articles/please-pass-the-salt-1510011834","link","https://www.wsj.com/articles/please-pass-the-salt-1510011834","wsj.com",38,43,7,0,4,0,0,7

It’s riddled with loopholes and kickbacks that penalize success and hurt hardworking taxpayers. This is why tax reform is a priority for me and this is why I voted to move the debate forward, despite concerns I continue to have regarding the deductibility of state and local taxes (SALT).  I advocated so strongly for the SALT deduction because it shields New Yorkers from the oppressive burden Albany places on our taxpayers. Albany politicians have zero respect for the taxpayers. Governor Cuomo and liberals in the Assembly continue to increase our bloated budget while hiking taxes on hardworking New Yorkers. Their harmful habits will never change.   The eight counties I represent have among the highest property tax rates as a percentage of home value in the nation because Albany’s crushing unfunded mandates continue to drive up the cost of living in our state. I have always put the taxpayers I represent first and it is long past time for politicians in Albany to do the same. Now it's time for Governor Cuomo and the State Legislature to lower the state taxes so the federal tax cut has an even larger tangible impact for New Yorkers.   I will continue to make state and local tax deductibility a top priority as this bill heads to conference between the House and Senate.  H.R. 1 begins to tackle our costly, complex, and unfair tax code by doubling the standard deduction for individuals and families, which will dramatically increase the simplicity of our tax code. In addition, the bill reduces the number of brackets and lowers tax rates in each, except for the rate on the highest income earners, which remains unchanged. All Americans deserve to keep more of what they earn and this bill will put more money in back in the paychecks of hardworking New Yorkers.  By doubling the standard deduction, simplifying the bracket structure, and lowering rates, low- to middle-income individuals and families will benefit from a tax structure that is easier to understand and more generous.  A married family of four in the 22nd District with a median household income of $85,692 could expect a tax cut of almost $1,900 while a single filer with a median income of $52,967 could see a tax cut of almost $1,700.  H.R. 1 is a step in the right direction. While this bill is not perfect in its current form and there are changes I will continue to advocate for, especially on the SALT front, I strongly believe that passing the Tax Cuts and Job Act is a critical step to move this important process forward and ensure our tax codes reflects the values of fairness and hard work.","status",NA,NA,240,569,43,34,4,2,10,353

The mission of this agency is important, but a lack of accountability breeds a culture of corruption.   No agency in the history of our nation has been structured like the CFPB. In fact,  the D.C. Court of Appeals declared the Bureau’s structure unconstitutional, as the unelected director “enjoys more unilateral authority than any other officer in any of the three branches of government of the U.S. Government, other than the President.”    In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act enabled this agency to act without any significant degree of Congressional oversight. Under the CFPB’s current structure, one single director heads the agency.   Nearly all regulatory agencies operate under a multi-member board or bipartisan commissions to ensure checks and balances are in place. The CFPB does not.  The CFPB unilaterally issues regulations that affect millions of consumers and businesses throughout the country, but it has the power to spend money and regulate without oversight from Congress, the President or the Federal Reserve.  An agency that employs nearly 1,500 unelected bureaucrats must be subject to the same oversight measures as any other federal agency  New leadership brings a new opportunity to ensure that the CFPB is subject to rules that all other federal agencies comply with.

Named in honor of a veteran and West Point Graduate who was murdered in Tel Aviv, Israel in 2016, this bill would halt taxpayer funds from being made available to the West Bank and Gaza until the Palestinian Authority ends its practice of providing monetary rewards to terrorists and their families.  Since the early 1990’s, the Palestinian Authority has provided financial compensation and employment benefits to Palestinians who have committed acts of terrorism. In 2016, programs providing compensation to terrorists and their families were funded at approximately $300 million, the same amount the Palestinian Authority received in foreign aid from the United States.  It is deeply troubling to know that for years the Palestinian government has funded and incentivized terror attacks, while receiving monetary aid from the U.S. taxpayer.

I am grateful for the diligent work of my colleagues in the House and Senate and I am honored to be a cosponsor of this important, bipartisan legislation.

This bill would allow qualified law-abiding citizens who have obtained concealed carry permits to carry their firearm across state lines and in other states, eliminating the need for multiple state permits for those traveling across state lines. The provision also extends to residents of Constitutional carry states, which do not require a permit for a citizen to lawfully carry a concealed firearm. I am cosponsor of this bipartisan bill.  Conflicting state regulations on concealed carry have been confusing for many law-abiding gun owners. Establishing nationwide reciprocity will streamline regulations allowing permit holders to cross state lines without the worry of breaking the law. This bill does not impact state’s authority over regulations for carrying within their borders. Additionally, the “Fix NICS” provision of this legislation would add an extra layer of accountability to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System for individuals who are legally prohibited from obtaining a firearm.   Nationwide reciprocity will streamline federal standards to ensure that the rights of law-abiding gun owners are protected across state lines. If a law-abiding gun owner unknowingly crosses state lines, they shouldn’t have to worry about breaking the law due to conflicting concealed carry regulations. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 is a common sense solution to end this complex and confusing maze of regulations.  Additionally, Article 4, Section 1 of the United States Constitution requires, ""Full Faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state."" This provision allows state driver’s licenses to be recognized in all 50 states. There is no reason that this same provision should not extend to our 2nd Amendment Rights.  This bill will also allow concealed carry in the National Park System, National Wildlife Refuge System, and on lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management, Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation.   Since 1991, the number of concealed carry permits have drastically increased, while the violent crime rates have dropped nearly 51% according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

This bill would rollback escrow regulations on small community financial institutions while providing relief from new regulations that have nearly doubled the cost of servicing loans, specifically for low-income borrowers. The bill would not prohibit community banks from providing escrow services if the institutions still desires to offer the service.  With smaller staffs and significantly less resources than larger financial institutions, community lending institutions are often unable to bear the costly burden of maintaining escrow accounts for their customers. Mandating that all institutions follow these escrow requirements raises the cost of credit for borrowers who can least afford it while harming small local institutions.   On average, America loses one community bank per day. The Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act works to reverse this problem by lowering the cost of credit for low-income borrowers and rolling back onerous escrow regulations that continue to drive community institutions out of the mortgage lending market. This bipartisan bill will ensure that small institutions can continue to lend to their communities.   Since 2006, more than 1,500 banks have failed, been acquired or merged due to economic factors and the overwhelmingly expensive regulation brought forth by the passage of the Dodd Frank Act. For the first time in over 125 years, there are fewer than 6,000 banks and roughly 6,000 credit unions serving all consumers in the United States. Additionally, a 2014 study by the Independent Community Bankers Association cited that regulatory burdens prevented 73 percent of banks from making residential mortgage loans.

Under this bill, the typical American family making $73,000 will see a tax cut of $2,059. A family with two children earning $52,967, the median household income in the 22nd District, would save $1,458, while a single filer with one child and an income of $30,000 would save $834. This means New Yorkers will receive an immediate raise in their January paychecks.  I fought an uphill battle to include provisions facing elimination that are vital to seniors, single parents, struggling families and overly burdened job creators throughout the debate on tax reform. Last week, I urged House and Senate leadership to retain the deductibility of up to $10,000 of property taxes, the federal Historic Tax Credit (HTC), and provisions allowing for the deductibility of medical expenses. Despite the fact that these provisions faced the very real threat of elimination and were not included in the original bill, my efforts were ultimately successful in securing the Historic Tax Credit, expanding the SALT deduction, and continuing the deductibility of medical expenses, to assist our most vulnerable seniors in defraying high medial costs.  In the 22nd District, where 99 percent of itemizers deduct less than $10,000 in property taxes, this provision will cover the overwhelming majority of property owners who own homes that are less than $450,000 in value.  The SALT deduction is so important because it shields New Yorkers from the oppressive burden Albany places on our taxpayers. Governor Cuomo and Albany politicians have zero respect for the taxpayers. The Governor and liberals in the Assembly continue to increase our already bloated budget, causing taxes to skyrocket year after year for hardworking New Yorkers. This bill will provide relief on the federal level while finally taking a step to encourage fiscal responsibility from Albany.  In my home state of New York, politicians in Albany have imposed one unfunded mandate after another on our local governments and local school districts. In turn, they have to pass this burden from the state down in the form of increased property taxes or cuts in services.   This is wrong and it’s Albany’s fault. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the property taxes that my constituents pay. A 2013 study from the Brookings Tax Policy Center ranked more than 3,000 counties by their ratio of property tax to home value. All eight of the counties I represent in upstate New York, although far from wealthy, are in the top 36 nationwide. Cortland County comes in at No. 6 and Oswego County at No. 15.  For struggling families and small businesses, the status quo is not working. Passing this bill is the first step to providing desperately needed relief.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Conference Report:  Lowers rates on virtually all income brackets.  Retains the State and Local Tax Deduction. Filers can now use the $10,000 cap for property tax and either income or sales tax.  Preserves the Medical Expense Deduction and lowers the threshold to 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income.  Preserves the Historic Tax Credit.  Doubles the Standard Deduction.  Doubles the Child Tax Credit.","status",NA,NA,150,331,14,19,11,0,1,167
