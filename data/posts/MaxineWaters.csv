At the time, I was discussing my opposition to H.R. 78, a Republican bill that would require the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to undertake an extremely onerous and financial industry-friendly cost-benefit analysis to the detriment of its rulemaking and enforcement duties that protect investors. Right before the interruption, I stated the following: ‘And further, Donald Trump has nominated a lifelong defender of Wall Street to lead the SEC, which I can only assume means that Trump’s SEC will eagerly pillage the Commission’s overworked enforcement staff to help pay for the Republicans’ planned repeal of Dodd-Frank.  As President-elect Trump takes office next week beginning what is the most conflicted Administration in U.S. history, I urge my colleagues to join me, investor and consumer advocates, public pension plans, civil rights groups, labor unions and supporters of financial reform in opposing H.R. 78 to ensure that the actions of Trump’s SEC are in the interest of Americans’ economic stability, and not in Russia’s or Wall Street’s interests.’  As I continued to speak extemporaneously about how the bill would obliterate the SEC’s regulatory authority, the broadcast was inexplicably interrupted by programming from RT.  “C-SPAN has informed my office that they are investigating the issue and do not yet know how the online broadcast was compromised. C-SPAN also said that this type of occurrence was unique and its staff could not readily recall a similar interference in its programming. Placed in the context of current events concerning cyberattacks and foreign interference in our elections, it is very important that C-SPAN provide a clear and concise explanation for the interruption of its online broadcast before we can reach any conclusions or establish the basis for additional inquiry.”","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/business/media/cspan-russia-today.html","nytimes.com",1220,293,2458,25,20,493,24,398

Following questioning from several Senators, Betsy DeVos was not forthcoming about whether schools receiving federal funding should meet the accountability standards established under the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act, which is an obligation she did not know federal law required states to comply with. She refused to commit to uphold current Title IX guidelines on sexual assaults on college campuses, and she refused to commit to not privatizing public schools.  “Betsy DeVos, who testified that she has no practical or meaningful experience in the public education system, who has never attended any public primary, secondary or post-secondary school, and whose children have never been enrolled in a public school, is incredibly unprepared to run the Department of Education’s elementary and secondary school programs. In fact, Betsy DeVos’ most well established experience in education policy stems from a long record of financing and lobbying for policies favoring the privatization of public schools, which sends necessary tax funding away from students who need it most. In her home state of Michigan, Betsy DeVos is best known for propping up charter schools, which sometimes operate on a for-profit basis and have a mixed record of success. In 1999, Betsy DeVos and her husband both asserted that the school choice agenda would fundamentally improve education, but despite their vast efforts in Michigan and untold millions spent in the state, Michigan’s charter schools perform worse on national tests in reading and math than Michigan’s public schools, which also do not perform very well.  ""Unlike previous secretaries of education, Betsy DeVos has never served as a teacher, school administrator or school system leader. Neither has she previously served in public office. Instead of genuinely committing her time to actually educating students or helping teachers, Betsy DeVos has — by her own admission — bought influence through massive political donations to advance her policy agenda.  “Furthermore, having never applied for student loans for herself or for her children, she is equally unqualified to run the department’s $1 trillion dollar student loan bank. Betsy DeVos failed to provide any detail on how to protect students from predatory, fraudulent for-profit colleges and universities, which for decades have allowed institutions like Trump University, ITT Tech, and Corinthian Colleges to cheat students from their funds while saddling them with insurmountable debt.  ""Our children, teachers and parents deserve better and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to reject Betsy DeVos.”","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/us/politics/betsy-devos-education-secretary-confirmation-donald-trump.html","nytimes.com",1026,140,472,74,2,21,25,186

President Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2.8 million votes and was elected with the assistance of the Russian government, has managed in a single week to offend a key ally, raise premiums on homeowners, and implement an un-American immigration ban, all while advancing new lies and conspiracy theories with each passing day.    The Administration's ban on immigrants from certain predominantly Muslim countries is not the result of thoughtful policymaking, but yet another action catering to the President's small base of support.  The order prohibits entry into the U.S. to immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries – Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen – for the next 90 days and suspends the admission of refugees for the next 120 days.  This shortsighted executive order fails to make any distinction between people who deserve to come to the United States and those who do not.  The order has already resulted in the detention of an Iraqi man who courageously worked with the U.S. government for 10 years after the U.S. invaded Iraq.  The order even prohibits re-entry to permanent U.S. residents from these countries, who will now be forced to apply for waivers just to return to their homes and families in the United States.   The Administration’s ban on refugees is especially deplorable.  It targets women, men, and children who are fleeing brutal repression in countries like Syria and who were hoping to find freedom in the United States of America.   Contrary to what the Administration would have the American public believe, the Administration's immigration ban is not even an effective way to combat or prevent domestic terror attacks.  Of the most tragic terrorist attacks that have occurred on American soil over the past few years, including the Boston marathon bombing, the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting, and the San Bernardino shooting, none of the perpetrators were born in any of the seven affected countries. The order does not even cover Saudi Arabia, the country that was the origin of 15 of the 19 terrorists who carried out the horrendous September 11th terrorist attacks.   The President’s executive order was clearly motivated by prejudice against Muslims and a desire to appeal to a small group of people who share his prejudiced views.  However, instead of making our nation a safer place for all Americans, the order will make us less safe by providing ISIS and other terrorist groups propaganda that they can use to recruit new fighters and encourage attacks.   Not only is the Administration's immigration ban immoral and likely unconstitutional, it goes against everything for which the United States stands, as a nation of immigrants and a beacon of hope for people around the world.   President Trump must understand that governing a nation is serious business and his actions have consequences both in the United States and abroad.  The American people are not pawns in a reality show, and he cannot simply sit in the White House and sign decrees as if he were a king unbound by any check on his power and authority.   Those in Congress who remain silent and fail to condemn this executive order will share in the responsibility for the resulting injustices.","status",NA,NA,8604,719,5063,1373,14,41,638,210

In a press conference announcing the legislation with other progressive Members of Congress, Congresswoman Waters delivered the following remarks:  Like so many of you, we have been shaken by events that have occurred over the last 11 days since Donald Trump was inaugurated.  We have been shaken by the lies, the deception, and the stunning level of incompetence.   In just under two weeks, Donald Trump has unnerved our allies, challenged our values, and brought so much instability and chaos to our country.  This chaos is sure to please at least one person – Vladimir Putin.  For everyone Trump is quick to bully, from world leaders to gold star families, to disabled Americans, there seems to be one person on the world’s stage who can do no wrong in Trump’s eyes.  A dictator and former KGB agent who armed Assad in Syria as he attacked innocent civilians appears to be the only man that Donald Trump will not disparage.  Given the extensive ties between Russia and individuals associated with Trump, we cannot ignore the possibility that there may have been collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.    Both during his campaign and since his election, Donald Trump has surrounded himself with people who have extensive ties to Vladimir Putin and the Russian government.     • Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, was a paid lobbyist for Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian politician in Ukraine who fled to Russia in 2014 and was subjected to U.S. sanctions related to Russian aggression in Ukraine.  Manafort has also been involved in multimillion dollar business deals with Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs, which were reportedly the subject of an FBI inquiry.  • Roger Stone, Trump’s longtime friend, is reportedly under investigation for possible links with Russia. He has denied ever visiting Russia but admitted he had worked in Ukraine.  Stone announced in a speech last summer that he had spoken to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and Stone predicted that there would be additional leaked documents, a prediction that came true within weeks.  • Michael Flynn, Trump’s National Security Advisor, did a paid series of events in Moscow, including a speech and appearance at a party for RT, a Kremlin-funded TV station, where he was photographed sitting right next to Vladimir Putin.  • Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, was a business partner of Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch and Putin ally, in a major financial project involving the Bank of Cyprus.  • Finally, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Trump’s nominee for Secretary of State, signed a multibillion dollar agreement with Russia in 2011 on behalf of ExxonMobil for an oil drilling project in the Arctic. The project was brought to a halt in 2014 as a result of the sanctions that were imposed on Russia in response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.  Putin personally awarded Tillerson the “Order of Friendship” in 2013.  The financial dealings and alliances in this Trump-Putin circle present obvious conflicts of interest for the Trump Administration, and they are too significant to be ignored.    Why did Paul Manafort and the Trump campaign push for softer language on the Ukraine in the Republican platform last summer?  What did Paul Manafort and Roger Stone know about the cyberattacks on their political opponents?  Why would Donald Trump deny knowledge of Russian responsibility for hacking even as he encouraged cyberattacks on his political opponent? We must find out just how involved the Trump campaign was in Russia’s interference in our election.  That is why I am introducing a resolution to focus on what Congress must do to thoroughly investigate Trump’s connections with Russia and whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the outcome of the election.  We cannot allow any investigation led by the Republicans in Congress to whitewash Trump’s ties to Russia or avoid examining these critical questions.         ###","photo","https://www.facebook.com/MaxineWaters/photos/a.440793370008.203423.117483585008/10154174068425009/?type=3",NA,3352,587,1851,727,9,48,1,16

Not only did the President fire Sally Yates for her refusal to enforce a poorly conceived and likely unconstitutional executive order, but upon removal, he had the audacity to describe her actions as a “betrayal.”  If unquestioned loyalty to President Trump supersedes adherence to the Constitution and the rule of law, then we should all be deeply concerned about the Justice Department Donald Trump is shaping. Ironically, it was the President’s own Attorney General Nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions, who strongly questioned Yates at her confirmation hearing about her willingness to be an independent decision maker, remaining legally objective, even if it meant disagreeing with the President. Our democracy demands leadership that truly makes our citizens safer, not leadership that spreads chaos and uncertainty haphazardly as President Trump has done over the course of the last eleven days.   Sally Yates served her country with distinction, exhibiting a profound reverence for the Justice Department. The President would do well to have more dedicated, seasoned, and professional public servants advising his policies rather than a small circle of political figures whose principle objective is to appease his very small base of support.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/31/donald-trump-firing-sally-yates-isnt-the-big-story-how-he-did-it-is/?utm_term=.dcd846729dfc","washingtonpost.com",2318,342,1115,211,13,39,58,461

President Trump, who lost the popular vote by 2.8 million votes and was elected with the assistance and support of the Russian government, David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan, appears determined to govern as he ran his campaign, appealing only to the most extreme elements of our society.    Steve Bannon is neither a national security expert, nor does he have foreign policy or intelligence experience that would justify his placement on a council charged with the safety and security of the American public.  As a master manipulator, Steve Bannon’s chief objective is to continue to use President Trump as a ‘blunt instrument’ to burn down the proverbial house and rebuild our government from the ground up, in a manner that would serve only a tiny fraction of the American people.    Steve Bannon’s radical views against Muslims are also troubling given the sensitive alliances that must be preserved in the fight against ISIS.  As someone who called for the formation of a ‘church militant’ to ‘bind together’ in a ‘war against Islam,’ Steve Bannon’s appointment to a council advising on national security would further alarm our global partners who are already unnerved by President Trump’s incoherent foreign policy goals.

As I have argued for months, President Trump’s ties to Russia and his curious admiration of Vladimir Putin warrant public and congressional scrutiny.  Throughout his campaign and into his presidency, Donald Trump has refused to criticize Putin and even lavished him with praise.  During the campaign, he publicly encouraged Russia to hack into his opponent’s emails.  In December, he tweeted that Putin was “smart” for not immediately retaliating against the United States following President Obama’s imposition of new sanctions.  He has taken Russia’s side against the American intelligence community when confronted with leaks and revelations he does not like. Recently, when asked during a Fox News interview about Putin’s reputation for murdering Russian journalists and dissidents, President Trump threw the United States under the bus, saying, “we have a lot of killers,” in our country too.  Trump has surrounded himself with a #KremlinKlan – people  who have extensive ties to Vladimir Putin and the Russian government.   For example:  Mike Flynn, Trump’s disgraced former National Security Advisor, has a long history of ties to the Russian government, in addition to the recent revelations about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about U.S. sanctions in December.  Those ties included a paid speech at a party for RT, a Kremlin-funded TV station, where he was photographed sitting next to Vladimir Putin.  Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, was a paid lobbyist for Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian politician in Ukraine who fled to Russia in 2014 and was subjected to U.S. sanctions related to Russian aggression in Ukraine.  Manafort has also been involved in multimillion dollar business deals with Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs, which were reportedly the subject of an FBI inquiry.  Carter Page, one of Trump’s foreign policy advisors during his campaign, was a frequent guest on Russian state media and held a personal stake in Russian oil and gas interests that was reportedly worth millions if sanctions could be lifted. He left the Trump campaign following a report that the CIA was investigating his Russian connections.  Roger Stone, Trump’s longtime friend, is reportedly under investigation for possible links with Russia. He has denied ever visiting Russia but admitted that he had worked in Ukraine.  Stone announced in a speech last summer that he had spoken to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and Stone predicted that there would be additional leaked documents, a prediction that came true within weeks.  Wilbur Ross, Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Commerce, was a business partner of Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch and Putin ally, in a major financial project involving the Bank of Cyprus.  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signed a multibillion dollar agreement with Russia in 2011 on behalf of ExxonMobil for an oil drilling project in the Arctic. The project was brought to a halt in 2014 as a result of the sanctions that were imposed on Russia in response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. In 2013, Putin personally awarded Tillerson the “Order of Friendship.”  The financial dealings and alliances in Trump’s Kremlin Claninner circle present obvious conflicts of interest for the Trump Administration, and they are too significant to be ignored.    A thorough congressional investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election must seek answers to a broad range of questions surrounding the Trump campaign and its connections to the Russian government.  For example, why did President Trump appoint Mike Flynn to the sensitive and vital position of National Security Advisor when he knew about Flynn’s ties to Russia? Was Flynn acting on Trump’s orders when he discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador in December? What is the extent of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s relationship with Russia and the Ukraine?  How much did Manafort and Flynn know about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and the Russian cyberattacks?  How much did President Trump himself know, and how much did his campaign staff and other associates know?  The strength and credibility of our nation’s democratic institutions depend upon a full investigation into these questions.  That is why, in January, I introduced H.Con.Res. 15.  This resolution states that Congress should expend the resources necessary to investigate thoroughly the nature and extent of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether, and to what extent, there was collusion between persons associated with the Russian government and persons associated with President Trump and his campaign.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/MaxineWaters/photos/a.440793370008.203423.117483585008/10154216739215009/?type=3",NA,1827,977,564,197,31,23,5,44

Do not be misled. Donald Trump is a compulsive liar who will say and do anything to distract from the very serious questions about his associates' and campaign's ties to Russia. Despite his efforts to stonewall and obstruct credible investigations, Donald Trump's lies are being exposed and each passing day brings new revelations to light.  “For months, Donald Trump has claimed that his campaign and associates had no connections to Russia.  And yet, we now know that several key individuals in his inner circle were in communication with Russian operatives and subsequently tried to obscure those meetings.  Why would Jeff Sessions, Carter Page, and Mike Flynn conceal their meetings with the Russian Ambassador during a time when the intelligence community was warning US officials that Russians were interfering in our elections? Why would Jared Kushner then hide his meeting with Mike Flynn and the Russian Ambassador during the transition?  Why did Donald Trump deny the intelligence community’s report on the Russian interference in the 2016 election, insult federal agents, and instead side with the Kremlin in denouncing what intelligence officials concluded about the Russian cyberattacks?  Why has President Trump at every juncture shown more deference to the Kremlin than the American analysts and agents who serve and fight to protect this country every day?  In my estimation, it is because Donald Trump has something to hide and doesn't want the American people to know the truth.  “Despite his outlandish accusations against President Obama, the fact of the matter is an American President cannot unilaterally authorize a wiretap on anyone. For President Trump to ask for a congressional investigation based on his ridiculous claims is shameful and just another attempt to deflect attention from his ‘Kremlin Klan” and the investigations into his campaign’s ties to Russia.   “Shame on this President and anyone around him who fuels and enables his lies and vitriol.  The question now is for Republicans of conscience in the House and Senate.  How long will they let this unhinged man wreak havoc on our democracy?  That's not hyperbole.  That is the stated objective of Trump’s closest advisor, Steve Bannon.  Steve Bannon wants to break our system and I stand ready to fight him and Trump every step of the way.”","photo","https://www.facebook.com/MaxineWaters/photos/a.440793370008.203423.117483585008/10154269558060009/?type=3",NA,2061,2798,916,270,152,21,6,237

In his 95 years of life, President Mandela, or ""Madiba"" as he was affectionately called, was a revolutionary and transformative leader who forever changed the world through his steadfast dedication to freedom, equality, and human rights. After spending 27 years in prison, Nelson Mandela became the first black South African to be elected President in what was also the first free, multi-racial, democratic election in South African history. While President Mandela used his administration to dismantle apartheid, combat institutional racism, and begin the process of racial reconciliation in his country, his efforts also taught the world the power of one man having the fortitude to sacrifice his own ideals for a cause greater than himself.   To me, Nelson Mandela is more than a world-renowned hero – I had the distinct honor and privilege of calling him a friend. His leadership of the international anti-apartheid movement encouraged me to take action here in the United States where I served as the Los Angles Chair of the Free South Africa Movement, organized countless anti-apartheid rallies in Los Angeles, led a sit-in at the South African Consulate General Office in Los Angeles, and was even arrested during a protest at the South African Embassy in Washington, DC. As a member of the California State Assembly, I fought for the passage of Assembly Bill 134 which forced California to divest $12 billion in state pension funds tied to the apartheid regime in South Africa. Additionally, in 1990, I chaired the committee in Los Angles that brought over 90,000 people together in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to welcome Nelson Mandela into the United States, and I also traveled with the official United States delegation to South Africa in 1994 to attend his inauguration as President of South Africa. In 1998, I was honored to welcome President Mandela to the United States once again, this time to receive the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal.   As we reflect on Nelson Mandela’s memory today, on what would have been his 99th birthday, let us remember when he once said, ""What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead."" Few embody this quote better than Nelson Mandela himself, and it is my sincere hope that my own career in public service lives up to his extraordinary example.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/MaxineWaters/photos/a.440793370008.203423.117483585008/10154653000750009/?type=3",NA,2220,382,283,600,29,3,3,8

A president’s budget is the blueprint of a president’s priorities and values, and Donald Trump’s budget makes it glaringly clear that he does not care about hard-working Americans and their families.

I consider Dick to be one of the most brilliant and transformative comedians the world has ever seen. Dick was unafraid to confront racism and bigotry in his performances which helped to shine a light on the injustices African Americans faced in this country, particularly in the Jim Crow South, and he is revered for breaking down barriers that prevented African American comedians from entertaining all white audiences, paving the way for African American comics today.  Beyond his genius on stage, Dick was a champion for equality, often risking his own career, health, freedom, and, at times, his life in order to fight injustice and oppression. He was a prominent figure during the Civil Rights Movement, who despite his own fame, would cancel shows and risk millions of dollars to join marches, sit-ins, and other peaceful demonstrations across the country with other leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Whitney M. Young, Jr., and Rev. Jesse Jackson. However, Dick’s activism was not limited to the Civil Rights era; he was a lifelong activist, who also fought against apartheid in South Africa, the Vietnam War, police brutality, misogyny, and abuses against Native Americans. Furthermore, his intellectual curiosity inspired him to write numerous books and to vigorously research health and nutrition, which he and I spent countless hours discussing.  Most importantly, however, I knew Dick to be a family man who was a devoted husband to his wife of more than fifty years, Mrs. Lillian Gregory, and a loving father to his surviving 10 children whom he encouraged and supported in their individual lives and careers.    Dick will forever be remembered by fans all over the world for his talent, intellect, and unwavering commitment to justice. However, to me he was more than a world renown comedian and activist – he was my brother. I am so grateful for all of the precious memories that we have shared over the past years, especially a few months ago when I joined him in our hometown of St. Louis, Missouri, where at 84 years of age, he captivated a packed audience with his one of a kind wit, charm, and humor. Dick will certainly be missed, and my thoughts and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this rough time.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/MaxineWaters/photos/a.440793370008.203423.117483585008/10154743877485009/?type=3",NA,3775,994,668,995,23,9,1026,12

These DACA recipients came to America as children, innocent of any wrongdoing.  For many, this is the only country that they know.  They registered with the government; they underwent background checks; they go to school here; they live in our communities; and they pay taxes.  For all 800,000 of them, the United States is their home.  Donald Trump has demonstrated again and again, on an almost daily basis, an extreme lack of empathy and a disregard for the plight of others.  In phasing out DACA, he revealed that he not only lacks empathy, but that he’s spineless too.  For a man, who has so often thrown around the threat of lawsuits for the slightest perceived grievance, to now phase out DACA because he’s scared of a legal threat from the Texas Attorney General shows that Trump – the bully – will back down from a fight, even when that fight affects hundreds of thousands of people. Trump routinely deflects and abdicates his presidential responsibilities, and his DACA decision is yet another example. He is more abdicator–in-chief than commander, and America again must look elsewhere for leadership.  I will fight every day for those Americans affected by Trump’s selfish, politically motivated and reprehensible actions.

On #WorldAIDSDay2017, we must confront these challenges and fight to expand research, prevention, screening and treatment efforts to ensure that all Americans living with HIV/AIDS receive the care and treatment they need and deserve.

""I am so pleased that the Postal Service has responded to my request to adopt a new #Alzheimer’s Semipostal Fundraising Stamp. The new stamp will promote public awareness and raise funds for medical research for this tragic disease, which affects more than five million Americans and has no effective treatment,"" said Rep. Maxine Waters (CA-43).    On July 1, 2016, Congresswoman Waters wrote a letter urging the Postal Service to issue an Alzheimer’s stamp as the first stamp under its discretionary authority.  This letter was signed by a bipartisan group of 41 Members of Congress under the leadership of Rep. Waters; Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-NJ), Co-Chair of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer’s Disease; and Task Force Member John Garamendi (D-CA).  The Alzheimer’s stamp is now the first stamp issued under the Postal Service’s discretionary program, just as the Congresswoman had requested in her letter.

Both the House and Senate bills explode the deficit by over $1 trillion and raise taxes on the middle class in order to spend on tax cuts for the wealthy. After ten years, those making $75,000 or less would see a tax increase, while those making $1 million or more would see their taxes decrease.  Under the House bill, tens of millions of working families nationwide would experience a tax increase by 2027. I hope that the Tax and Spend Republicans on the other side of the aisle will come to their senses before sending a final bill to the president’s desk."" #TaxandSpendRepublicans","video","https://www.facebook.com/MaxineWaters/videos/10155018281295009/",NA,3340,680,1124,867,132,31,25,63

The bill raises taxes on the hard-working middle class, borrows against the future by adding trillions to the deficit, forces millennials to fix our deficit crisis years from now, and rapidly accelerates the concentration of wealth toward the top 1%.    This is yet another conscious decision by the #TaxandSpendRepublicans to ignore the needs of millions of Americans who have worked hard to provide for themselves and their families, and, instead, prioritize the profits of large corporations, while enriching GOP donors, special interest groups, and Donald Trump himself.
