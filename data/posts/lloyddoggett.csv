Even though he is stepping aside, I think that putting three Republicans in charge of an investigation that has been so bungled by one is not reassuring. While Mike Conaway is an amiable and thoughtful colleague whom I respect, the only way to restore public confidence is with a nonpartisan, independent, comprehensive review of the Russian attacks and any possible involvement of Trump associates. For months, I have been one of those, like Senator John McCain, seeking such action. Instead, as with the Trump tax returns cover-up, Republicans seem much more interested in protecting Trump than learning the truth.","link","https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-intelligence-committee-chairman-devin-nunes-stepping-aside-from-russia-probe-1491486707","wsj.com",158,12,15,3,3,7,1,9

The claim that his multi-trillion dollar tax cut will pay for itself is as incredible as the claim that Mexico will pay for his multi-billion dollar border wall. Dripping in red ink, this proposal validates Trump’s boast that he is “the king of debt.” For Trump and his cohorts, “fiscal responsibility” is just a political slogan used to undermine the vital education, health care, and social services that they oppose, not a genuine commitment to restraining the national debt.     Boasting of his previous influence in bending the Tax Code to his whim, Trump claims only he can fix it. But will he “fix” it for himself, or fix it for the middle class? Without an end to the Republican cover-up of Trump’s tax returns, we cannot determine whether this is mostly just more self-enrichment for the Trump family.   His international tax plan lowers taxes on investment abroad, incentivizing companies to export jobs and profits. And he rewards corporate tax dodgers, who have previously stripped earnings from American sales and buried their treasure in exotic foreign tax havens, by taxing them at a mere dime on the dollar.     Trump talks like a populist but governs like a plutocrat. Like the near trillion dollar tax cut in the failed health care bill that he endorsed, Trump’s tax plan fills the coffers of giant corporations and lines the pockets of the superrich.  #TrumpCarnage","status",NA,NA,187,37,68,2,0,4,13,88

We have known since the March decision of the three-judge federal court in San Antonio that Texas Republicans used crooked lines to engage in unconstitutional discrimination.  And now for the first time since this litigation began in 2011, this decision was unanimous.  State Republicans have until the weekend to decide whether they will try again to run me out office by carving up the district in yet another way. If not, the federal court will conduct a hearing on September 5 to determine how to remedy the Republican wrongs. The Texas Attorney General has already stated his plan to appeal anything that the San Antonio Court does.  And so the U.S. Supreme Court will have the final say. Election authorities have said that the upcoming November filing for all offices on the 2018 ballot cannot begin unless this case is finally resolved by October 1.  That is why I continue to say that I plan to continue to serve in CD35 exactly as it is configured today, until such time as the U.S. Supreme Court rules otherwise. This matter is far from resolved. I will continue to remain fully accessible and accountable to my constituents in Bexar, Travis, Hays, Caldwell, Comal, and Guadalupe.

He expands his outrageous misconduct regarding Charlottesville to condone racist policies directed at Latinos. Trump just fully pardoned the criminal misconduct of a fellow notorious anti-immigrant figure-- former Phoenix Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Trump can pardon, but he cannot remove the stain of racism. Trump can praise wrongdoing, but he cannot hide his disgraceful action nor that of Arpaio.  As my Arizona colleagues Reps. Ruben Gallego, Raul Grijalva, and Tom O'Halleran recently noted, ""Latinos in Maricopa County were up to nine times more likely to be pulled over than non-Latinos. His department was also determined to have systematically violated the rights of Latinos by the Justice Department in 2011 and by a federal judge in 2013.""  And the Judge who was about to sentence Arpaio has said ""Not only did Defendant abdicate responsibility, he announced to the world and to his subordinates that he was going to continue business as usual no matter who said otherwise.""","status",NA,NA,324,95,116,3,3,10,97,273

Only hours before formally announcing the Republican tax break plan, we were given a preview of generalities that do not match what specifics are already known about this plan that is allegedly so “great” and which will make everyone so “happy.” Despite repeated claims of “no tax cuts for the rich,” this plan does the opposite by cutting the top tax rate and eliminating the estate tax.  It creates incentives to ship even more American jobs abroad.  Claiming that tax breaks will magically pay for themselves is like claiming Mexico will pay for his wall.

I have long pressed the FAA to strengthen balloon safety to avert another disaster. While I have a pending amendment to long-delayed FAA legislation that would require such operator certificates, I am once again requesting the FAA to act immediately on its own initiative before another tragedy occurs. I agree fully with the NTSB Chairman that the FAA has been “shirking its responsibility.” FAA’s rejection of NTSB recommendations would condemn more unsuspecting families to death.","link","http://www.statesman.com/news/local/ntsb-calls-faa-require-medical-checks-for-hot-air-balloon-pilots/BKa11pP5db1P9YgbUqjBDI/","statesman.com",62,12,3,3,0,0,5,0

And this article is correct that like the previous Statesman report, I actually understated the real inequity occurring later this decade when 80% of the benefits would go to those making $912,100 or more.  At an estimated cost of about $2.4 trillion, this proposal jeopardizes our economic health and threatens our ability to make make other vital public investments including to ensure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare.   The article notes that I sounded the alert, as the Ranking Democrat on the Tax Policy Subcommittee, before this Republican  “legislation itself had yet to debut.”  Just like their failed Obamacare  repeal bill,  the Republican scheme is to have the full 1,000+ pages of this legislation “debut” as late as possible so the public will learn as few details as possible and presenting Democratic amendments and alternatives will be as difficult as possible.   We can, however, begin to understand its impact based upon what was called for in the June 2016 House Republican “Blueprint,” most of which they have reaffirmed multiple times.  Our House Ways and Means Committee is now rumored to begin consideration of this measure, which is still yet “to debut,” two weeks from tomorrow.

Incredibly, for such a broad bill, this plan has never had a single public hearing, nor has any Trump Administration official had the courage to come before this Committee and answer questions about it. No expert witness has been given the opportunity to explain this bill’s deficiencies, nor has there been an opportunity for thorough, independent evaluation of the proposal in this this rush to injustice.  Like the rushed-through Trump immigration policy and the health care repeal disaster, we need to learn from experience, we need some vetting – in the President’s words, we need ‘extreme vetting.’ If they don’t have anything to hide, a week and one public hearing won’t impair their efforts.","video","https://www.facebook.com/lloyddoggett/videos/10155412332063705/",NA,499,111,141,18,0,14,2,73
