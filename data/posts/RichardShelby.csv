These efforts will help ensure that NOAA counts red snapper where they actually live – on reefs.  I’m pleased that this assessment will provide an independent check on NOAA’s internal counts for red snapper in the Gulf, which is long overdue.

This week, President Trump announced his intention to nominate three Alabamians to serve as U.S. Attorneys for the state’s Northern, Middle, and Southern districts.   Jay E. Town, of Huntsville, to be U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama. Since 2005, Jay has been in the Madison County District Attorney's office, where he is a senior prosecutor. He previously served as a judge advocate in the U.S. Marine Corps for 12 years. Jay Town is very qualified and, once confirmed, will be a great fit for the position.   Louis V. Franklin, Sr., of Montgomery, to be U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama. For close to three decades, Louis has been a federal prosecutor in the Middle District. He was the Assistant U.S. Attorney from 1990 to 1996 and again from 1998 to 2001. Louis Franklin is an honorable pick, and his immense expertise will enable him, once confirmed, to step into this role with ease.  Richard W. Moore, of Mobile, to be U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama. Moore is currently the inspector general for the Tennessee Valley Authority, a position he was nominated to by George W. Bush in 2003. Prior to his time at TVA, he served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Alabama’s Southern District from 1985 to 2003.

During today’s Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, I highlighted that the Port of Mobile is the nation’s 10th largest seaport and is a major employer in the state. I then went on to question Lt. General Semonite about the Mobile General Reevaluation Report (GRR), which is currently examining the potential deepening and widening of the Port of Mobile. The GRR is expected to be completed in fall of 2019.  Lt. General Semonite spoke to the Port of Mobile’s potential and its ability to continue to put “skin in the game.”  He continued, “These large shippers are going to go where it’s the best business for them … We want to be able to optimize those ports that really have the potential to have national capabilities, and Mobile is certainly one of those.”  Click below to watch the exchange.","video","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWS6V9XFCcE",NA,87,81,8,0,1,1,1,3
