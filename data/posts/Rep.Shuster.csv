The American people made it clear that they wanted a Congress and White House that will work together to advance ideas that will strengthen our economy and restore our powerful standing around the world. Today is just the beginning of what is going to be an important step forward for this nation.   As Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I’m ready to work with President-elect Donald Trump to rebuild America’s infrastructure. We are going to invest in our roads and bridges, modernize our outdated aviation system, and continue improving our waterways. President-elect Trump is also ready to work with us on destroying ISIS, and I appreciate the opportunity to serve on a committee that will be tasked with ensuring our military has the tools needed to do so.   We are going to be a stronger nation after the 115th Congress passes common sense policies that will not be blocked by President Obama, but signed into law by our Republican Administration.

He addressed the issues impacting people of all backgrounds – from sky rocketing health insurance premiums hurting families in rural areas to rising crime rates in our cities, this is a president that is going to listen to the people and act.
