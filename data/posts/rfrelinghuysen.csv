The VA says it now expects to open a Community Based Outpatient health care Clinic (CBOC) in Newton on January 9 at 222 High Street.  A formal ribbon-cutting ceremony will be scheduled shortly thereafter.   “For over two years, I have been working with my Congressional colleagues, Sussex Freeholders, state legislators and veterans leaders to bring greater access to health care to veterans in Sussex County by convincing the VA to establish a community health clinic,” said Frelinghuysen. “Of course, there have been bureaucratic obstacles along the way, but we would not back down in our efforts to get VA to do its job to serve those who have served us in uniform.”  The Newton clinic will be open Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.  Previously, Frelinghuysen was instrumental in the establishment of a veterans outpatient clinic in Morris Township.  The VA's New Jersey Health Care System consists of two main “campuses"" in East Orange and Lyons in Bernards Township with additional satellite clinics in Elizabeth, Hackensack, Hamilton, Jersey City, Paterson, Piscataway and Tinton Falls. Many veterans from Sussex County now use the Morris Township clinic - more than an hour's drive from parts of the county.  Financial support for the Sussex CBOC will be provided through the annual Military Construction-VA Appropriations bill drafted by Frelinghuysen’s House Appropriations Committee.  This legislation provides advanced funding for veterans health care, fully funds veterans’ benefits and programs and contains the dollars to house, train, and equip military personnel, provide housing and services to our troops’ families, and help maintain military base infrastructure.  -30-","status",NA,NA,35,43,3,1,0,0,0,0

Little Rock, Ark., Tampa, Fla. and Mascoutah, Ill..   Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, California was also selected as a MOB 4 “preferred alternative” for basing KC-46 tankers.  The final basing decision is expected in the summer of 2018.  The first new tankers are expected to arrive at JBMDL no later than the Spring of 2021.   -30-","status",NA,NA,28,18,1,0,1,0,0,1

Secretary of the Army, Eric Fanning, made the presentation in a ceremony in Frelinghuysen’s Washington office.   “As an Army draftee many years ago, it never crossed my mind that the Secretary of the United States Army would see fit to honor me,” Frelinghuysen said.  “But I am truly honored to receive the Army Civilian Public Service Award.  Supporting our soldiers and their families —past and present—has been, and will remain, a number one priority for me.”  The citation from Secretary Fanning states: “Representative Frelinghuysen was a tireless public servant advancing Congressional support for funding the Army to meet rapidly evolving threats to our nation’s security and ensuring Soldiers have what they need to succeed….His exceptional contributions were integral to the Army receiving the necessary support to support combat, sustain the all-volunteer force, and improve the quality of life for Soldiers, Civilians and Families.  He vigorously supported Army efforts and worked diligently to overcome the fiscal and political challenges inherent in funding our national security priorities.  Representative Frelinghuysen’s distinctive accomplishments and unwavering commitment reflect great credit upon him, the United States House of Representatives, and the United States of America. ”  The Army Decoration for Distinguished Civilian Service was established in May 1956. The Secretary of the Army awards this decoration to those who provide distinguished service that makes a substantial contribution to the accomplishment of the Army's missions.  Frelinghuysen serves as Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.  He previously served as Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense and with the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.    -30-","photo","https://www.facebook.com/rfrelinghuysen/photos/a.196628087157897.1073741828.191509977669708/776051509215549/?type=3",NA,93,62,5,8,0,4,0,4

Frelinghuysen (NJ-11), the only member of the New Jersey Congressional delegation to chair a full House Committee, today steered the fiscal year 2017 Defense Appropriations bill, H.R. 1301, through the House by a vote of 371-48. The bill will now be considered by the Senate.    The bill funds military operations overseas, increases the purchase of state-of-the-art aircraft and ships and improves readiness of our troops to meet global threats.  The measure also provides for a 2.1% pay raise for our troops and strengthens the various health programs for military personnel and their families.  In addition, H.R 1301 enhances New Jersey’s contributions to our national security. “Our nation faces serious new challenges across the world.  Our troops are serving with honor in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Korea, Japan, the Baltics and Africa,” Frelinghuysen said. “The rebuilding of our military starts today and I applaud the House for passing it with such a strong bipartisan vote.”   In addition to providing base operating funds for New Jersey’s military installations, Picatinny Arsenal, Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, Naval Weapons Station Earle and the 177th Fighter Wing in Atlantic City, the legislation includes funding that will boost New Jersey’s military contributions.  For example, H.R. 1301 contains new funding to allow scientists, engineers and technicians at Picatinny Arsenal, the DOD Joint Center of Excellence for Armaments, to accelerate their urgent work to ensure that our weapons systems overmatch those of our adversaries.  The bill also includes funding to expand production of the new KC-146 Pegasus air refueling tankers that will be stationed at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst beginning in 2020, enhancing the future missions of the New Jersey base.    To protect New Jersey residents at home and abroad, the measure includes $1.9 billion above the President’s budget for key readiness programs to prepare forces, including the National Guard and Reserve, for peace-time missions and potential overseas operations in the United States.   “Protecting the strength and sustainability of New Jersey’s unique military installations is critical to all of our Armed Forces,” Frelinghuysen said. “Supporting these bases is vital to both our national defense and our state’s historical support for national security.  Beyond a doubt, they are essential to our economy, our national security, and our future.”  In total, H.R. 1301 provides $577.9 billion, an increase of $5.2 billion over current spending and $1.6 billion more than the Obama Administration sought in its last budget request. This includes $516.1 billion in base discretionary funding – an increase of $2 billion above current levels – and $61.8 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)/Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) funding – $3.2 billion above current levels. When combined with the $5.8 billion in supplemental funding enacted in the December Continuing Resolution, total Defense funding for fiscal year 2017 is $583.7 billion, an increase of $10.9 billion over fiscal year 2016. -30-  https://youtu.be/Gic4EuAgICk","link","https://youtu.be/Gic4EuAgICk","youtu.be",31,59,2,0,0,0,0,10

Rodney Frelinghuysen (NJ-11) brought a veteran National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) “Hurricane Hunter” to visit with students at four schools in his Congressional District on Monday, April 24, 2017, CDR Justin Kibbey, a National Oceanographic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) pilot.  Schools the Congressman visited are as follows:  Memorial Middle School (Whippany)  Valley Road Elementary School (Stanhope)  Lenox Elementary School (Pompton Lakes)   Littleton Elementary School (Morris Plains)  “Commander Kibbey has thousands of hours of flying experience in some of the worst hurricanes to approach or hit our shores,” said Frelinghuysen.  “His presentation educated all of us on hurricane science.”  Frelinghuysen added, “We share the same goal: to convince students the value of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education.  Hopefully, Commander Kibbey’s experience will inspire many boys and girls to pursue their life’s work in these fields.  For these students, this very presentation may be key to their future.   STEM education, from preschool through college, prepares pupils for well-paying careers across education levels. The median annual wage for STEM workers is more than double the median wage for all workers. This holds true across education levels, including the 25% of STEM workers with less than a bachelor’s degree. Beyond this reality, STEM is the future of our U.S. economy.”  Commander Kibbey of the NOAA Corps is a veteran P-3 pilot. In March 2010, he was selected for an interservice transfer from the U.S. Navy to the NOAA Corps at the Aircraft Operations Center in Tampa, Florida. He flew his first hurricane mission in September 2010, and he has flown approximately 20 flights every year since. He helps scientists gather data by flying planes into hurricanes.  ###","photo","https://www.facebook.com/rfrelinghuysen/photos/a.196628087157897.1073741828.191509977669708/836291966524836/?type=3",NA,25,76,1,2,0,0,0,10

Frelinghuysen, expected to be approved by Congress by a bipartisan majority and signed by the President this week, contains funding important to New Jersey.   “This package of the remaining Appropriations bills is the result of over a year’s worth of careful and dedicated efforts to closely examine federal programs to make the best possible use of every tax dollar,” said Frelinghuysen.  “This legislation will fund critical federal government activities, including our national defense, and enact responsible funding decisions to target U.S. investments where they are needed the most, including many in New Jersey. It also maintains and enhances policies that bolster economic growth and support the core values that our nation is built upon.”  Details of the entire appropriations package can be found here:  http://appropriations.house.gov/news/documentquery.aspx?DocumentTypeID=2151&CatagoryID=34778  To summarize just a few New Jersey priorities:   Amtrak Northeast Corridor/Gateway  The Transportation-Housing and Urban Development (T-HUD) title of the bill adds $75 million for Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor for a total of $328 million.  The bill’s intent is that Amtrak will use a significant share of the additional funding to address issues related to the Gateway project.  Specifically, the Statement of Managers” states: “The agreement allows Amtrak to undertake new capital projects and encourages Amtrak to prioritize strategic rail infrastructure improvements at critical points in the rail network that would improve current services or create new capacity.”  Highlands Open Space/Drinking Water Protection    The Interior title of the package contains $10 million for land conservation partnership projects and open space purchases from willing sellers in the four-state Highlands region: New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Connecticut, a critical watershed region which provides drinking water for millions.      Homeland Security Non-Profit Security Grants  The Homeland Security title of the Continuing Appropriations bill includes $605 million for the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and $25 million to be designated for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) which supports “target hardening” and other physical security enhancements to nonprofit organizations that are at high risk of terrorist attack.  In the wake of a recent wave of anti-Semitic threats against synagogues and Jewish schools, the total funding for the NSGP is $5 million higher than current levels.  Urban Search and Rescue  The Homeland Security title provides $38.2 million for FEMA’s Urban Search and Rescue system (USAR) and included is a “one-time increase” of $3.1 million from the current budget levels “to ensure teams are uniformly equipped.” New Jersey Task Force 1 is the newest member of the USAR, having joined less than one year ago.     HUD-VASH Homeless Vouchers  The T-HUD title contains $40 million above President Obama’s last budget request for 3,700 new vouchers for housing for homeless veterans under the HUD-VASH program.  The FY 2017 Military Construction-VA appropriations bill, passed last year, provided funding for 79,000 veterans.    Housing Vouchers for People with Disabilities (Frelinghuysen Vouchers)  Under the T-HUD title, the final bill includes $120 million for Section 811 vouchers for persons with disabilities – the “Frelinghuysen Vouchers” – $10 million above President Obama’s FY 2017 budget request to provide new housing opportunities for persons with disabilities.  Defense  The Department of Defense (DOD) portion of the Omnibus funds critical national security needs, including military operations and readiness programs, as well as health and quality-of-life programs for our troops and military families. In total, the bill provides $593 billion, an increase of $19.9 billion over the fiscal year 2016 enacted level and $16.3 billion more than the Obama Administration’s request.   When combined with the $5.8 billion in supplemental funding enacted in the Continuing Resolution that passed in December, the total Defense funding for fiscal year 2017 is $598.5 billion, an increase of $25.7 billion over fiscal year 2016 and $22.1 billion more than President Obama’s original request.  The DOD portion of the legislative package contains significant new money to fund critical efforts by the Armaments Research Development Engineering Center (ARDEC) at Picatinny Arsenal to increase the range, lethality, and survivability of U.S. military units on the battlefield.   In addition, the measure provides funding for the planning and design, in FY 2017, of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Research and Development Center at Picatinny Arsenal in FY 2019.   In addition to providing base operating funds for all of New Jersey’s military installations including Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, Naval Weapons Station Earle and the 177th Fighter Wing in Atlantic City, the bill includes funding that will increase New Jersey’s military contributions.  Protecting the strength and sustainability of this state’s unique military installations is critical to all of our Armed Forces.  Supporting these bases is vital to both our national defense and our state’s historical support for national security.

Only then can Congress put forward our own plan to fund the federal government, ensuring the wise investment of taxpayer dollars on important programs while trimming back or eliminating waste and duplication.  ""The Appropriations Committee has already begun this process, and it will continue rapidly over the next weeks and months. We intend to work as quickly as possible – while maintaining the highest standard of responsibility – to complete the fiscal year 2018 Appropriations bills in a timely fashion.

The United States Air Force has now informed U.S. Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (NJ-11) that Air Mobility Command (AMC) has decided to sequence the aircraft to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst with first aircraft arrival in FY2021, and to Travis Air Force Base with first aircraft arriving FY2023.  This schedule is dependent on the delivery of the new KC-46 aircraft to the Air Force by Boeing.    AMC made the decision based on JBMDL’s proximity to vital refueling routes to and from Europe.  Additionally, the base will host the regional maintenance facility as well as a key maintenance training facility, thus benefitting from earlier aircraft delivery.    “The Air Force’s decision to base new KC-46 tankers in New Jersey is an endorsement of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst as one of the nation’s premier air mobility installations,” said Frelinghuysen.  “Fielding the KC-46 to the Joint Base first recognizes its importance to maintaining the critically important ‘air bridge’ from the continental U.S. to Europe, but also the Middle East, Africa and beyond.  I can’t think of a better base to host this new tanker.”       As immediate past Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, Frelinghuysen for years advocated for basing the KC-46 tanker at JBMDL with senior Air Force leaders, including various Chiefs of Staff of the Air Force.  “The message over the years has been simple: McGuire has the location, the facilities, the experience and the workforce to ensure that the Air Force maintains its ‘global reach.’  Nothing is more important for the warfighter!”  The final basing decision is expected in the summer of 2018.  The first new tankers are expected to arrive at JBMDL in Fiscal Year 2021.   -30-","status",NA,NA,16,26,1,0,1,0,0,0

This bill makes investments in essential highway, air, rail, and maritime programs that will keep our people and our goods moving efficiently,” Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen said. “I am especially pleased that more than $900 million will be allocated to the Gateway program in the New Jersey-New York area in this legislation.”    “It is not an overstatement to say that Gateway is critical to our nation’s economy.  The Northeast Corridor region, encompassing over 50 million people from Washington D.C. to Boston, produces approximately $3 trillion in economic output, equal to 20% of our national Gross Domestic Product.  Safe and reliable passenger rail travel through New Jersey and New York City is essential to that economic productivity.”  “Rebuilding the Hudson Tunnels is of vital importance to my home state of New Jersey and our region.  From 2002-2014, the number of New Jersey residents commuting to New York City grew by more than 35%.  However, New Jersey residents have been plagued by perpetual delays and decaying infrastructure commuting, and reverse commuting, into New York City.  The Gateway project, especially the proposed new Hudson River Tunnel, serves both public transportation (NJ Transit) and intercity passenger rail (Amtrak).  $500 million will be provided in “rail state of good repair grants” - authorized primarily for NE corridor – from Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) funds.  Another $400 million in transit money is tied to soon-to-ready-for-construction funding for the Hudson Tunnel and the Portal North Bridge.   In addition, a significant portion of Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor $328 million in funding will be used to support projects associated with Gateway.   ####  In total, the Fiscal Year 2018 Transportation-Housing and Urban Development bill reflects an allocation of $56.5 billion in discretionary spending – $1.1 billion below fiscal year 2017 and $8.6 billion above the Administration’s budget request. This funding is targeted to essential investments in transportation infrastructure investments, as well as a variety of community development and housing programs.    -30-","status",NA,NA,32,115,3,1,0,0,0,7

The bill will target funding to U.S. foreign policy priorities, including critical diplomatic and security missions to increase stability and security. It also contains funding to bolster U.S. allies and key partners in strategic and challenging areas of the world, and provides critical humanitarian aid.  In addition, the legislation contains strong oversight measures and reductions to nonessential or lower-priority international programs to protect and save taxpayer dollars.   “In the wake of ever growing international threats and challenges – such as the recent North Korean missile test – it is more important than ever for the U.S. to invest in robust diplomatic and global efforts to ensure stability around the world and the security of our nation and our allies,” Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (NJ-11) said. “The world is a better place when the United States leads and the funding in this legislation allows us to conduct strong diplomatic and economic development efforts.  This ‘soft power,’ along with the ‘hard power’ provided by our military is essential.”    Partners and Allies - In addition, the legislation provides security assistance to key allies and partners.  The bill fully funds the $3.1 billion commitment to allow Israel to maintain its qualitative military edge over its neighbors.    The bill continues strong support for Foreign Military Financing programs for Ukraine, Georgia, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Tunisia – at or above current levels.    The bill maintains robust funding for counter-narcotics and law enforcement efforts in Colombia, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.  The legislation also fully funds the $58 million request to address international organized crime and increases funding to combat cyber-crime.  International Security Assistance – The bill provides a total of $8.8 billion in funding for international security assistance. This is $614 million below the fiscal year 2017 enacted level. Funds are included for international narcotics control and law enforcement activities, antiterrorism programs, nonproliferation programs, peacekeeping operations, and other critical international security efforts.  Antiterrorism programs that assist in the fight to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and other terrorist groups are funded at $358 million. The bill also provides funding to fight terrorist financing networks and bolster border and airport security.   United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Operations – The bill contains $1.5 billion for USAID and the USAID Office of Inspector General. This funding is targeted to activities to provide stability in volatile regions and enhance U.S. presence in critical and strategic areas.  Cuba – The bill includes a funding limitation with respect to diplomatic facilities in Cuba (with certain exceptions) until the President determines and reports to the Committee that the requirements specified in section 205 of the LIBERTAD Act have been met.  The bill includes an explicit reference to the requirement regarding the extradition of persons sought by the U.S. Department of Justice for crimes committed in the U.S.  Additionally, report language notes that Joanne Chesimard, convicted in the 1973 murder of a New Jersey State Trooper, is among those individuals being sought for extradition.   Increased Oversight, Savings, and Policy Provisions – The bill continues robust requirements to increase program oversight, improve management, and tighten the reins on taxpayer dollars. Some of these provisions include:    Countering Russian Influence and Aggression – The bill maintains the fiscal year 2017 level for Ukraine and Georgia to respond to Russian aggression and provides $105,000,000 for Countering Russian Influence Fund.    Syria – The bill allows funding to be used for non-lethal aid.  Oversight and vetting of recipients is required.  Egypt – The bill provides economic and security assistance if Egypt sustains its strategic partnership with the United States and adheres to the peace treaty with Israel.   Afghanistan – The recommendation includes conditions on assistance for transparency, accountability, and prohibits funds for new major infrastructure projects.    Palestinian Authority –The bill maintains strong restrictions on the Palestinian Authority (PA), including a requirement to reduce funds to the Palestinians by an amount equivalent to that expended by the PA as payments to prisoners that committed acts of terrorism, prohibiting funding if there is a Palestinian government formed through an agreement with Hamas or if the Palestinians are not acting to counter incitement. The bill also includes a provision restricting Palestinians’ representation in the U.S. if they initiate or actively support an International Criminal Court investigation against Israel.  “Lautenberg Amendment” – The bill extends the so-called “Lautenberg provision”, which lowers the evidentiary standard for certain refugee applicants from the former Soviet Union and Iran, subject to religious persecution, including Iranian Jews and Christians.  Guantanamo Bay – The bill requires a notification to Congress if the State Department commits to providing assistance to foreign governments that accept Guantanamo detainees. Additionally, the bill requires regular reporting to Congress on any negotiations related to detainee transfers.   UN Reform – The bill provides no funding for the Human Rights Council unless the Secretary of State determines that it is in the national security interest and the Council stops its anti-Israel agenda. The bill also prohibits funds for UN organizations headed by countries that support terrorism, and withholds a portion of funds for the UN and international organizations until transparency and accountability measures are taken.   North Africa Strategy Requirement –The bill includes a new provision requiring the Secretary of State to submit a strategy for United States engagement in North Africa, including information on how diplomatic engagement and assistance will be prioritized for the region.  In total, the bill provides $47.4 billion in both regular discretionary and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding. This total is $10 billion below the fiscal year 2017 enacted level, when counting additional funds provided in the Security Assistance Appropriations Act of 2017. Within this total, OCO funding totals $12 billion, which supports operations and assistance in areas of conflict, such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.  -30-","status",NA,NA,9,12,2,0,0,0,0,4

The bill, also known as the “Make America Secure Appropriations Act”, was passed on a vote of 235-192.   The bill includes the full legislation and funding for four of the 12 annual Appropriations bills, including: the Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, Energy and Water, and the Legislative Branch Appropriations bills. This funding extends through the entire 2018 fiscal year.   “After years of unnecessary and unwise cuts to our national security, this legislation represents the next step forward in rebuilding our military and ensuring our nation is ready to meet any current or emerging threat,” Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen said. “This bill will provide our forces with the resources they need to do their jobs and ensure the success of our missions.  As Chairman, I am pleased to support New Jersey’s historic role to improve the lethality, effectiveness and safety of our troops.”  For example, the Department of Defense section of H.R. 3192 provides over $130 million in funding to the Armaments Research Development Engineering Center (ARDEC) at Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County as a follow-up to a recent study conducted under the auspices of the Office of Secretary of Defense.  “The OSD study identified specific areas of concern including loss of weapons range overmatch, effects of enemy countermeasures to GPS, and the proliferation of low-cost commercially available unmanned aerial systems.  This bill provides the funding to allow the experts at Picatinny to advance the capabilities of our Armed Forces as soon as possible.”   In addition to providing operations and maintenance monies for every New Jersey military installation, the bill also provides $2.4 billion for another 15 KC-46 aircraft – the new airborne tanker that will be stationed at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.  In addition to providing the highest level of funding in history for veterans medical care, the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs section of the package includes funding to help Joint Base-McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst prepare for the arrival of the Air Force’s new KC-46 tanker, providing money for a new hangar, apron and fire hydrant modifications, a maintenance training facility, “boom operator” and fuselage trainers and equipment storage building.  In addition, the legislation provides $11.6 million for apron and taxiway improvements at JBMDL.   “The funding for New Jersey’s Joint Base is an endorsement of the installation’s current and future military value. Ensuring that the proper resources are available to conduct successful missions from New Jersey is vital,” Frelinghuysen said.  The Energy and Water section of H.R. 3192 includes funding for:  • New Jersey Back Bay Study ($449k) to continue research to bring relief from back bay flooding. The New Jersey Back Bay (NJBB) is located behind the New Jersey barrier islands of Monmouth, Ocean, Atlantic and Cape May Counties and includes the set of interconnected water bodies and coastal lakes that are separated from the Atlantic Ocean;  • Green Brook Sub-Basin ($20 million) to continue construction on a series of channel modifications, levees with limited floodwalls and dry detention basins.   • Funding is also provided in the bill for the Passaic River Flood Warning System, which assists the public and emergency managers forecast and prepare for riverine flood events; • Additional Operating and Maintenance (O&M) funding is provided for a number of projects throughout New Jersey to keep our waterways dredged and our beaches replenished.    Funding for the Office of Science is $5.4 billion, $919 million above the President’s request.  The money is used to keep the national laboratories, including Princeton Plasma Physics Lab, at the forefront of global scientific discovery.    Frelinghuysen noted that the report to accompany the FY 2018 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill highlights the significance of the 2016 completed New Jersey/New York Harbor Deepening project, declaring , “This project of national significance is an example of how the (Army) Corps and its partners can work together to enhance our national economy.”  For a bill overview, please visit: https://appropriations.house.gov/uploadedfiles/national_security_package_one_pager.pdf  -30-","link","https://appropriations.house.gov/uploadedfiles/national_security_package_one_pager.pdf","appropriations.house.gov",23,67,7,3,1,1,0,19

Hundreds of thousands of homes damaged. Businesses destroyed,” said Frelinghuysen.  “The funds in this bill will be used to continue life-saving recovery missions, help start housing repair, and provide timely low-interest loans to businesses and homeowners to start the rebuilding process.  The needs of the struggling people along the Gulf Coast are immediate and our response has been rapid.”   House passage came just five days after the Committee received a detailed request from the Trump Administration.  H.Res. 502 contains the full amount requested by the Administration – totaling $7.85 billion in emergency funding, including $7.4 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). This will ensure FEMA can meet all current needs for response and recovery efforts, while also being prepared for any additional disasters that may arise.  The measure also includes $450 million to support the Small Business Administration's disaster loan program to assist small businesses and homeowners begin to rebuild.  “It is clear that this recovery will be a long haul – and I want to assure Harvey’s victims that we will be there for them every step of the way. My committee will continue to keep close watch and will remain in contact with the Administration to ensure that funding is available for recovery today and months down the road.  ""Of course, our thoughts and prayers today go out to the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, Florida and other southeastern states that will soon deal with the effects of Hurricane Irma.

The delegation visited Jacksonville and Miami and took an aerial tour of the Florida Keys before visiting the Houston metropolitan area to assess Hurricane Irma and Harvey recovery efforts in order to ensure that funding is readily available to meet the needs of the victims of these disasters.  “These were distinctly different storms but they both shattered the lives of many of our fellow Americans.  Homes are destroyed.  Businesses are heavily damaged.  The power remains out in many areas.  The Florida Keys are particularly devastated,” said Frelinghuysen.  “The hundreds of thousands of victims of these destructive storms are still in the early stages of what will be a long and difficult recovery from Harvey and Irma, and now, Maria in Puerto Rico.

FEMA, working in coordination with its federal partners and an array of non-profit organizations, has already provided more than four million meals, six million liters of water, nearly 300 infant and toddler kits, and nearly 70,000 emergency roofing kits to the two areas since Hurricane Maria’s landfall.  Thousands of federal staff, including more than 600 FEMA personnel, are on the ground in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands supporting response and recovery operations.   The federal government is working with its interagency, non-profit partners and faith-based charities to support the transportation and delivery of fuel, based on priorities identified by emergency personnel on the ground in the islands.  The federal support for fuel transportation includes air and sea logistical support by the Defense Logistics Agency, U.S. Northern Command, the U.S. Navy, and U.S. Coast Guard, in coordination with the private sector.    Examples of additional federal support:   • The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has deployed 11 ships and over 100 aircraft to assist operations. Personnel continue to deliver critical FEMA relief supplies.  A mobile communications team arrived in Puerto Rico to help improve communications across the storm-impacted area.   • The Department of Defense has over 2,600 personnel in the Caribbean. The USS Oak Hill and the USS Kearsarge Amphibious Ready Group have conducted medical evacuations and 123 airlifts and delivered 22,200 pounds of relief supplies and cargo to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The Army’s 602nd Area Support Medical Company and a Civil Authority Information Support Element have been deployed to the Virgin Islands.  • The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an order on September 24 authorizing FEMA and DoD to install and operate temporary water treatment units to provide clean water in the U.S. Virgin Islands to address concerns about a lack of clean water supplies. • Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the DOD conducted medical evacuations for more than 150 patients from the islands to the continental United States. Medical evacuations from the islands will continue.  • The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) deployed debris experts to assist FEMA with debris management strategies in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands.  Additionally, USACE has 86 generators on hand in Puerto Rico and St. Thomas with more than 186 additional generators en route. USACE and other supporting agencies have completed nine temporary power installs on Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   • Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operations personnel are onsite in St. Thomas to evaluate, fix, and install FAA equipment, in support of air traffic control operations. • The National Guard Bureau (NGB) has thousands of Guard members on the ground in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands taking part in security and support operations. The Air Guard is focused on transporting food, water, and communications equipment.  • Customs and Border Protection airplanes and helicopters are assisting with conducting damage assessment and search and rescue missions. • More than 180 Federal Law Enforcement Officers are in San Juan and the Virgin Islands supporting search and rescue and medical teams.    ""The people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands remain in our thoughts.   There is no doubt that the challenges they face are truly tremendous. While significant progress has been made, full recovery will be very long and very trying. But the people should be reassured that they are entitled to equal treatment under the law and the Appropriations Committee and House Leadership will assure that every step of the way.""  “The Appropriations Committee plays a central role in ensuring that the federal government provides the help the victims need.

The bill will now move to the Senate for approval.   The legislation fully funds the funding requests submitted to Congress from the Administration.   It includes $18.7 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), $576.5 million for wildfire efforts, and $16 billion for debt relief for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which now needs additional funds to make necessary insurance claims payments to individuals. In addition, the bill includes a provision for the Disaster Nutrition Assistance Program (DNAP) that enables low-income residents in Puerto Rico to receive the same emergency nutrition assistance that other hurricane-affected states already receive.  The legislation also includes $4.9 billion for Community Disaster Loans (CDL) to help address local government challenges in the near term by providing funding for municipal service such as police and fire protection, trash collection and the operation of local schools.  “Millions of Americans have had their lives disrupted by destructive hurricanes and by raging wildfires in the West, said Frelinghuysen, Appropriations Committee Chairman, “We will continue to be with them every step of the way with federal support they will need throughout this recovery process.  “There is clearly massive, unprecedented damage, and more funding is necessary to continue response and recovery efforts and to help these communities rebuild. These emergency funds will address urgent, short-term, immediate priorities and provides assistance that will help our fellow Americans in their time of greatest need.  “We know this will be a long process, and this will certainly not be all that is required over the long term. But this Congress will work with the White House and state and local governments to ensure that assistance will be available.   “I now urge my Senate colleagues to approve this legislation as soon as possible, so these funds can be used immediately for those families and communities that need it most.""

Other cargo sectors were increased during the study period of 2014 – 2016. One of the primary enablers of this surge in commercial activity undoubtedly is the now-completed 20-year Harbor Deepening Project, funded by the Appropriations Committee.  “Our Port is the economic engine for northern New Jersey,” said Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (NJ-11), the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. “Ninety percent of global trade moves by ship, so I made it one of my highest priorities in Congress to ensure the Port of New York and New Jersey, the largest on the East Coast, remains the most attractive destination for international trading partners.  This study shows that our efforts are paying off for our state!”   Through his work as the only New Jersey member of the Appropriations Committee and past Chairman of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, Frelinghuysen secured hundreds of millions of federal dollars for the Harbor Deepening Project since its authorization in 1997.  By dredging the main channel to a depth of 50 feet and raising the deck on the Bayonne Bridge, the Port can accommodate the newest container ships, which sail along the U.S. East Coast now that the upgraded Panama Canal has opened to the world’s largest ships.    According to the report, compiled jointly by the New York Shipping Association and the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority, the Port accounted for nearly $8.5 billion in federal, state and local tax revenue last year and supported more than 400,000 jobs, up 20 percent over the two-year study period.  Port businesses and agencies employ 229,000 workers and support another 171,000 indirect jobs. The jobs include longshoremen, truckers, shipping clerks, mechanics, warehouse workers, tug boat operators, police and inspectors, and others.  In addition, the port industry was responsible for $25.7 billion in personal income and $64.8 billion in business income, up 21 percent for the period.  According to the report, New Jersey accounted for the greatest number of port jobs with 200,350 and total jobs with 344,470. The state also was responsible for the bulk of the taxes generated by the port industry with nearly $7 billion in federal, state and local revenue, which included more than $2.2 billion in local and state taxes and $4.8 billion in federal taxes.  “The Harbor Deepening project was a great example of how creative forward thinking and public-private partnerships can provide benefits for our region for years to come,” said Frelinghuysen. “We’re beginning to reap real rewards.”   -30-  Read a summary of the report here: http://nysanet.org/wp-content/uploads/PressReleaseNYSAEconomicImpactStudyV02.pdf","link","http://nysanet.org/wp-content/uploads/PressReleaseNYSAEconomicImpactStudyV02.pdf","nysanet.org",37,77,10,0,2,0,0,0

In fact, I was looking forward to voting for legislation that creates jobs, increases paychecks, reinforces fairness and expands the economy here at home, while strengthening America’s competitiveness around the world.  “However, I simply could not support the legislation due to very negative impacts it would have on so many of my fellow New Jerseyans.   -30-","status",NA,NA,283,335,34,23,2,6,2,43
