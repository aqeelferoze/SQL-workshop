Below is a link to a comprehensive overview of some of the highlights of what my colleagues and I accomplished over the past two years for the Valley, California, and our entire nation.   As Congress begins the 115th Congress, I will continue my efforts to: - improve water reliability, security and quality for all   Californians; - advocate for increased investment in our nation’s transportation and infrastructure systems; - work to fix a broken immigration system to make it more reliable and fair; - reform our tax system to make it less complex and ensure that everyone pays their fair share; - and reform entitlement programs, like Social Security and Medicare, in a responsible way, so we can protect the promise made to those currently dependent on these programs and ensure their long-term solvency for future generations.

Most recent scientific reports indicate that temperatures are rising, creating a decline in the snow pack that we have historically relied upon as natural water storage.  As a result, runoff will increase during the fall and winter months, requiring us to increase California’s water storage to ensure that farmers, farm workers, and farming communities are equipped with an adequate water supply in future dry years.

Regrettably, to reduce potential flooding, water is being released out to the ocean. That precious water could be used to replenish groundwater aquifers that were depleted during the drought or could be carried over in above ground storage for use in dry years. That water could help ensure that our farming communities will not continue to deal with double digit unemployment numbers.   The WIIN Act, which was enacted in December, provides funding for water storage and groundwater banking projects. It is my sincere hope that both surface storage and groundwater recharge projects, like raising the gates at New Exchequer Dam, and building Sites Reservoir and Temperance Flat Dam, and others, like the Los Banos Creek Reservoir and raising San Luis Reservoir, are advanced as rapidly as possible, so we can begin to capture the much-needed water that comes from these storms. Fixing California’s broken water system requires a multi-pronged approach, and focusing on how we improve our water infrastructure and storage capacity will be imperative as we work to update California’s water system so it can meet the growing demands of the 21st century. #CAstorm #CAflood","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepJimCosta/videos/1215144765199398/",NA,60,6,1,2,0,0,0,0

This afternoon, President Trump expressed support for a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico to pay for the wall. If implemented, a 20 percent import tax on Mexican goods would accelerate a trade war between the United States and Mexico. We saw similar effects of these types of trade wars most recently during the U.S.-Mexico trucking dispute, which took place for seven years between 2009-2015, when Mexico legally imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports. The California agriculture industry bore the brunt of those retaliatory tariffs. If President Trump and Republicans in Congress move forward with putting a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports, then California products are likely to be immediately impacted.   In addition to the economic effects of building a wall and imposing a tax on Mexican goods, immigrant children and their families are fearful of being deported. President Trump’s executive order only further divides our country and raises alarm among immigrant families.

President Erdoğan’s recent elimination of individual freedoms and jailing members of the press should not be rewarded by a visit to the Oval Office.  To add injury to insult, it appears that a contingent of President Erdoğan’s security team unilaterally took violent action against peaceful demonstrators who were raising awareness of Turkey’s violations of human rights. The Turkish security guards clearly attacked the Armenian, Kurdish, Yezidi, and other human rights demonstrators, sending nine to the hospital.  Sadly, it appears that history may be repeating itself. Many of us in recent weeks have seen the movie “The Promise,” which is an accurate historical portrayal of the Armenian genocide that took place beginning in 1915 at the hands of the Ottoman Empire. In the movie, we witnessed the beginnings of these acts of atrocity with the depiction of young, Turkish men beating innocent people. As we know, modern-day Turkey has been unwilling as a country to acknowledge the genocide ever happened. We cannot allow Tuesday’s violent and illegal behavior by the Turkish security guards to go unaddressed.  The actions of the Turkish security guards are outrageous, and I condemn them. They violate both American law and deeply-held American values. The Turkish security guards must be held accountable.  Our American President should take appropriate diplomatic and legal action against these Turkish thugs for their violence towards the Armenian, Kurdish, Yezidi, and other human rights demonstrators.

And, as a country, we are one nation. As our nation comes together in solidarity today, we are reminded of how vulnerable we all are to those who wish harm to our American way of life. We must peacefully unite in strength in the face of this hatred.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJimCosta/photos/a.189161674464384.42638.166497040064181/1359187054128501/?type=3",NA,61,6,1,5,0,0,17,0

In the United States, more than 10 million people are subjected to domestic violence each year.  Some of us have been working to end domestic violence. In Washington, D.C., Congressman Ted Poe and I have been leading the Congressional #VictimsRights Caucus in fighting to end domestic and sexual violence and in helping survivors. In my district, we have numerous organizations and local businesses working to help domestic violence survivors, including the Marjaree Mason Center, Central California Legal Services, Inc., Choice Women Empowerment, Centro La Familia Advocacy Services, Inc., Valley Crisis Center, Meathead Movers, and Fresno Plumbing and Heating.  Although we have been working hard to end domestic violence in our #SanJoaquin Valley and across the country, we must do more. Domestic abusers still commit these horrendous acts of violence every day, with an average of 20 people being physically abused by an intimate partner every minute in the U.S.   So as we near the end of Domestic Violence Awareness Month, I call on us all to stay vigilant in our efforts to end domestic violence and to help survivors recover, and I urge my colleagues to join me. Domestic violence has plagued our families, our communities, and our nation for far too long. We must end this hideous violence, once and for all.

Our tax plan should not add to our national debt or deficit, and we must ensure that it does not unfairly benefit certain groups while asking other groups to carry a disproportionately high amount of the costs. This type of comprehensive tax reform must be done through a bipartisan, transparent, and deliberative policy process.  Regardless of the rushed and partisan course my Republican colleagues have taken up to this point, I still take seriously my duty as a member of Congress and as a representative of the San Joaquin Valley. My staff and I will spend this weekend examining the tax bill reported out of the conference committee, paying especially close attention to the legislation’s expected effects on the national debt, America’s middle class, and the Valley’s agriculture system, economy, health care, students, and families.

The legislation the House passed today is fiscally-reckless and a sad excuse for reform, and it will harm people across our country and the San Joaquin Valley...

The bipartisan legislation would extend to Hmong and Lao Americans who served alongside U.S. Armed Forces during the Vietnam War burial benefits in national cemeteries.  Hmong forces saved countless American lives during the Vietnam War, and more than 100,000 Hmong made the ultimate sacrifice over the course of the war. These heroes deserve our nation’s deep gratitude, and granting Hmong veterans the honor of being laid to rest in our national cemeteries, such as the San Joaquin Valley National Cemetery, is long overdue.  In addition to having bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress, the legislation is supported by the national and #SanJoaquin Valley chapters of the Special Guerrilla Unit Veterans and Families Development of USA, Inc and the Lao Veterans of America.   #Hmong #HmongVeterans #AmericanHeroes  For more information: https://costa.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/costa-introduces-bipartisan-legislation-honor-hmong-veterans","link","https://costa.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/costa-introduces-bipartisan-legislation-honor-hmong-veterans","costa.house.gov",28,2,6,8,0,0,0,0
