These are the primary responsibilities of the federal government.  In the past few years, radical Islamic extremists have repeatedly attacked innocent civilians around the world. The memories of the massacres in Paris, Nice and Berlin are pressing. We have been victims of terrorism at home too, with the deadly attacks of San Bernardino and the Boston Marathon still fresh in our minds.  Our visa system, based on trust, is woefully inadequate to meet the threat which is presented by emigration from the Middle East. We are lacking processes to assure that anyone entering the United States has been thoroughly vetted and poses no threat to our country and its citizens. This is what the President is seeking to address.  Half of the people in the United States illegally right now came in on a legal visa and overstayed it.   There has been much discussion in the press about the order issued on Friday; some accurate, some not.   First, the executive order bans refugee admissions to the United States for a period of 120 days and  caps refugee admissions at 50,000 per year. These are refugees, not visa holders. They have no inherent claim of right to be admitted into the United States. It is important to note that in 2011, President Barack Obama issued a six month ban on Iraqi refugees entering the U.S., but there was no outrage from the liberal media then.  Second, the order bans, for a ninety day period, those seeking to enter the United States from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, although  exceptions can be made by the Secretaries of State or Homeland Security on a case by case basis. The purpose  of this ban is to have time to put  procedures and processes in place to gain control over our borders and assure the American people that we know who is coming in, why and what they will do here. We should demand no less than these basic safeguards from our government.  ###","status",NA,NA,63,30,35,3,0,1,0,7

The aim of this caucus is to educate members of congress and staff on important issues impacting the Everglades as well as generate support for the projects and funding still needed to complete restoration efforts.  Co-Chair of the Everglades Caucus, Congressman Mario-Diaz Balart said: ""I am glad to welcome Congressman Rooney to the Everglades Caucus. As Co-Chair, I am excited to have another member with the passion and commitment to continue advocating for the restoration of Florida's natural treasure.""  “As Co-Chairman of the Congressional Everglades Caucus, I am pleased to welcome Congressman Francis Rooney to the caucus. While great progress has been made in addressing the challenge of restoring the Everglades, one of the world’s most unique ecological systems, there is still much work to be done. This work can only be accomplished through dedicated, bipartisan efforts. With the addition of Rep. Rooney, the Caucus remains committed to advocating, educating, and finding lasting solutions for one of our nations’ most treasured and important ecosystems,” said Congressman Alcee L. Hastings.  Congressman Francis Rooney stated: “I am proud to join my colleagues in the commitment of Everglades restoration. The Everglades is one of the true ecological wonders of the world. For far too long our community in Southwest Florida has been plagued by water quality and ecological disaster. This has hurt our local economy and has forced businesses to close their doors. This is my number one priority for our community. We need the federal government to do their fair share - that was promised to us.”  Background:  Congressman Francis Rooney has long been an advocate to restore and protect the Everglades. Immediately upon being sworn in to congress on January 3, 2017 he has aggressively pursued educating members on the importance of funding restoration projects. He has personally met with the Army Corps of Engineers, Speaker Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Governor Scott and many other leaders advocating for the appropriation of preauthorized funds.","link","http://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=32","francisrooney.house.gov",25,0,13,0,0,0,0,0

For many years, Jordan has been an important strategic partner and key ally of the United States. Their stability in an unstable area of the world has been vital to defeating radical Islamic terrorists and advancing our collective security efforts in the Middle East.  King Abdullah addressed the House Foreign Affairs committee this morning and spoke about Jordan’s efforts in the fight against ISIS and their role in assisting with the ongoing Syrian conflict. The presence of more than 1.3 million Syrian refugees has increased the population of Jordan by more than 10 percent since the start of the conflict. Additionally, Jordan is an attractive target for attacks by ISIS due to its ties to the west and proximity to Syria.  In 2016, there were at least seven ISIS-directed or inspired attacks inside of Jordan. We are committed to a partnership with our friends and allies, the Jordanians, to solve the Syrian crisis and defeat the terrorists wreaking havoc throughout the world.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepRooney/photos/a.754691278011680.1073741828.749310315216443/767865046694303/?type=3",NA,17,1,2,1,0,0,0,0

Congressman Francis Rooney: “I, along with the entire Florida Delegation call on the President of the United States to support Everglades Restoration projects in his fiscal year 2018 Budget. The Everglades have a far ranging impact to the entire State of Florida and to the country.  Our economy has been decimated. Businesses have closed. We all have a vested interest in the Everglades.

We are fortunate to have this natural treasure in our state, and must do everything we can to preserve it for future generations.”  Congressman Hastings: ""The Everglades is one of the world's most unique ecosystems, and while much work has been done to repair this national treasure, there is still much work left to do.

The state of this unique ecosystem directly influences the health of Florida’s coasts and our water supply, and exerts a tremendous impact on our economy. Revitalizing and preserving this environmental jewel is an obligation we dearly owe to future generations. Our letter urges the President to honor his campaign pledge to protect and restore this essential piece of Florida’s natural environment.”     ###  http://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=41","link","http://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=41","francisrooney.house.gov",26,7,11,1,0,0,0,0

The focus of Congressman Rooney’s testimony will be to provide an update on projects that have been approved as part of the Central Everglades Restoration Project (CERP) and authorized by the Water Resource Development Acts (WRDA) of 2007, 2014, and 2016; and to seek support in uniting all parties in focusing on completion of these projects. Also testifying will be State Representative Matt Caldwell, chairman of the Government Accountability Committee. Congressman Rooney stated; “I would like to thank Chairman Caldwell and all of the subcommittee members for inviting me to speak on this topic of critical importance to our region. There are several projects authorized in the WRDA legislation passed in 2007, 2014 and 2016 which need funding to complete. The Lake Okeechobee watershed and Everglades have a far ranging impact to the entire State of Florida and to the country, but particularly in Southeast and Southwest Florida- where 55% of real estate in the state is affected, 2 trillion dollars of economic impact across 164 cities and 16 counties. We must stay focused and united to secure the funding necessary from Washington to complete these projects. The federal government has a lot of catching up to do, in order to meet its obligations” Representative Caldwell stated; “Congressman Rooney and I share a passion for Everglades restoration and the protection of the estuaries affected by the Lake Okeechobee discharges. I look forward to a continued partnership with the congressman and federal government to complete the projects that we have waited on for too many years.” On February 3rd, all members of the Florida Congressional delegation signed a letter, led by Congressman Rooney, that was sent to President Trump. This letter called on the President to support Everglades Restoration projects in his fiscal year 2018 Budget. Today’s hearing is a continuation of efforts to bring attention to the water quality issues affecting Florida and to build awareness and consensus for funding projects that have already been approved. Congressman Rooney is also a member of the Everglades Caucus, which is focused on restoration and preservation of the Everglades.  # # #  http://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=75","link","http://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=75","francisrooney.house.gov",20,5,6,0,0,0,0,0

As I work to build consensus and support for the science-based Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), it is important to understand how the 50/50 federal and state partnership works. Federal policy governing all Corps of Engineers (Corps) activity requires that local project sponsors, the state of Florida in this case, must provide funds for project lands, easements and other related costs. The federal role, mainly the Corps of Engineers, is to partner with the state to fund construction, operation and maintenance of projects on state land.   Currently, there are $7.2 billion in authorized projects, of which only $2.1 billion have been funded. Notably, the state has funded most of this $2.1 billion. As your Congressman, I am committed to making sure the federal government fulfills their part of the 50/50 agreement so that projects can be completed on the land the state is able to secure.   The Herbert Hoover Dike is an additional wrinkle in Everglades restoration efforts. The federal government is 100 percent responsible for repair and operation of the dike. The Corps estimates that it needs $500 million to finish repairs. Strengthening the dike would allow retention of some flood water in times of severe rains, reducing discharges.   The final element of existing projects is the completion of the Tamiami Trail bridge. This project was supposed to be a 50/50 cost share; however, the state has paid for 100 percent of the first mile of construction. A second 2.6 mile section is under construction, with the costs being split 50/50. Completion of the bridge is essential to allowing water to flow south into Florida Bay.","status",NA,NA,15,5,3,0,0,0,0,0

It is their right to protest, as they seem to be, in support of keeping Obamacare fully intact with no changes. While Obamacare may have helped a few people, it is devastating to so many more. They have every right to voice their support for the status quo no matter how detrimental it might be.     I believe we can and must do better.  I have heard from folks who are non-politically motivated individuals who are exasperated with Obamacare cost, reduced choices of health care providers and deductibles reaching into the thousands.     My promise on the campaign trail was that I would vote to repeal Obamacare and replace it with free market, patient-centric solutions that put people, not the government, back in charge of their health care. I intend to keep that promise. Congress is constructing a detailed replacement for Obamacare. Critical components being discussed are: ability to purchase insurance from anywhere in the country, regardless of state lines, like we do for everything else we buy today; commonsense medical liability reform to lower costs; and, despite the rampant fear mongering from the left, there will be protections for those with preexisting conditions.    Furthermore, I am looking forward to open and constructive discussions with the citizens of Southwest Florida on a whole host of topics during town halls in Naples and Cape Coral on March 3rd. Whatever concerns our community certainly concerns me.    Despite the instructions provided to the left in the “indivisible” guide, which we have seen acted out at town halls around the country, we expect the discussion to be civil and focused on real solutions to the most important issues facing our friends and neighbors here in Southwest Florida.","status",NA,NA,23,43,7,2,0,0,0,2

The key to Everglades restoration is the funding and completion of a series of projects authorized in the Water Resource Development Acts (WRDA) of 2007, 2014 and 2016 pursuant to the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project (CERP), enacted in 2000. Additionally, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers needs funding to complete reinforcement of the Herbert Hoover Dike around Lake Okeechobee. I continue to encourage the Committee to provide sufficient funding to the Army Corps of Engineers to carry out these important responsibilities.”  Wednesday’s subcommittee hearing marks the fourth time that Congressman Rooney has testified on water quality in the past month. Additionally, the entire Florida Congressional delegation has sent a letter, authored by Congressman Rooney, to President Trump requesting the inclusion of funding for Everglades restoration in his FY 2018 budget. Congressman Rooney is also a member of the bipartisan Congressional Everglades Caucus.  http://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=96","link","http://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=96","francisrooney.house.gov",13,3,1,0,0,0,0,0

In June of 2015, Scott received a letter explaining the termination of his current plan, requiring him to sign up for a plan under Obama Care that doubled his premium. Six months later he received notification from his insurance provider regarding a $800,000,000 loss in the first quarter of 2016, rendering them unable to renew his plan through the ACA, further explaining that the only insurance provider he could pursue would be Blue Cross Blue Shield. Instead of signing up for a plan costing $1,200 a month with a $7,500 per person deductible, he opted for a plan outside of the ACA and was faced with a penalty. #Obamacare #ItsNotWorking","status",NA,NA,13,38,5,0,0,0,1,9

I am encouraged that our delegation is working towards bipartisan solutions to resolve the mapping, mitigation, and underwriting issues related to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).   We specifically discussed the fact that Florida has been a “donor state” for decades, paying 27% of the program’s annual premiums while only accounting for 7.3% of the dollars paid in claims since 1978; and that the counties of Collier and Lee have paid 4.8% of the premiums but involved only 0.18% of the claims over that same period. With the NFIP losing 1.5 billion dollars a year, changes are necessary, however we must ensure that fair and affordable insurance options for Southwest Florida remain in place.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepRooney/photos/a.754691278011680.1073741828.749310315216443/796458470501627/?type=3",NA,19,4,2,0,0,0,0,0

Currently, one-third of U.S. counties and almost half of all counties in Florida have only one insurer offering exchange plans. Eighteen of twenty-three exchanges have failed and less than half of the expected exchange sign-ups have occurred.   The Obamacare replacement plan being considered by Congress is not perfect, but it is a good first step towards a free-market based health care system that puts patients back in control and lowers costs for everyone. This legislation will zero out the individual and employer mandates, which will save eight million people from paying a penalty. Additionally, 883 billion dollars in taxes will be eliminated and the deficit will be reduced by 337 billion dollars. The plan continues to protect individuals with preexisting conditions. The AHCA was substantially improved this week, by adding provisions to allow a work requirement for able-bodied Medicaid recipients, the option to provide block grants to states, and anti-abortion funding assurances.  This is a three-step process – The first step is to repeal with 51 votes under the reconciliation process. Second, Dr. Price, Secretary of HHS, can begin immediately eliminating the regulatory impediments to competition, access and choice in health care. The ACA was deliberately vague and he can take advantage of that vagueness now. Third, is legislation to fix whatever is left. As President Trump stated yesterday, these fixes should be less controversial and he will be pushing to help ensure their passage.","status",NA,NA,31,139,12,3,1,0,1,20

Res 67, by 50-49, terminating the Obama administration last minute regulation that forced private-sector workers into government-run IRAs managed by cities and counties.   Congressman Rooney stated, “This last-minute regulatory loophole created by the previous administration would have led to harmful consequences for both workers and employers. Hardworking Americans could have been forced into government-run plans with fewer protections and less control over their hard-earned savings. Employers would have faced a confusing patchwork of rules, and many small businesses might have forgone offering retirement plans altogether. I am grateful that Congress has acted to protect workers and small businesses from these misguided regulations.”   The resolution invokes Congress’s powers under the Congressional Review Act to prevent the regulations from taking effect. Passage of this resolution protects working families from losing control over their retirement savings and being forced into government-run IRAs with less financial security and fewer safeguards.   Additionally, it supports small businesses by blocking flawed regulations that would discourage them from offering private-sector retirement plans to their employees and shields taxpayers from potential liabilities associated with mismanagement of government-run retirement plans.   H.J. Res 67 was introduced by Congressman Rooney on February 2, 2017 and was passed by the United States House of Representatives on February 15, 2017.  ###  http://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=115","link","http://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=115","francisrooney.house.gov",15,8,1,0,0,0,0,0

Our economy is forever tied to our ecology, and having clean water flowing through our rivers, streams, estuaries and Everglades.   I fully support solutions that will solve our water issues in the quickest and most efficient way possible, and I agree with Governor Rick Scott and his priorities for restoring the Everglades. Any plan must support the Central Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), place priority on protecting land rights with no use of eminent domain, must avoid any long-term bonding debt and ensure completion of repairs to the Herbert Hoover Dike are not delayed.   At the federal level, I will continue to be vigorously focused on securing the federal funding already approved through the Water Resource Development Acts (WRDA) of 2007, 2014, 2016, and for moving up planning currently scheduled for 2018.  Background: Congressman Rooney has testified four times on water quality issues. In addition to this testimony, the Florida Congressional delegation has signed a letter, led by Congressman Rooney, that was sent to President Trump. This letter called on the President to support Everglades Restoration projects in his fiscal year 2018 Budget and included the signatures of all Florida Congressmen. Congressman Rooney is also a member of the Everglades Caucus.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepRooney/photos/a.754691278011680.1073741828.749310315216443/812599095554231/?type=3",NA,10,6,1,0,0,0,0,0

Repealing and replacing the failing and unsustainable social experiment of Obamacare is still a top priority of mine. Currently, one-third of U.S. counties and almost half of all counties in Florida, including Lee County, have only one insurer offering exchange plans. Eighteen of twenty-three exchanges have failed and less than half of the expected exchange sign-ups have occurred.   A patient-centric, private sector healthcare that provides choice and competition is the only solution that will work. Provisions to allow a work requirement for able-bodied Medicaid recipients, the option to provide block grants to states, and anti-abortion funding assurances are all components that are needed.  As a major health care provider and the largest employer in Lee County, it is critical to have the input and expertise of the professionals at Lee Health as we move ahead with any discussions in Washington.

Congressman Brooks said, “The American Jobs First Act is a timely compliment to President Trump’s ‘Buy American and Hire American’ effort by initiating much-needed reform of our foreign-worker visa program.  The H-1B visa program is designed to provide work visas for the best and brightest.  However, companies continue to abuse the program by forcing out American workers and replacing them with cheaper foreign workers.  We must stop bad-actors from undermining our economy and put American workers first by overhauling the H-1B program.”   Congressman Rooney stated, “The H-1B visa program, created to import temporary foreign workers to fill high-tech jobs, is too often used to replace Americans with cheaper foreign workers under the guise that Americans are not qualified for these jobs.  The American Jobs First Act addresses this problem by eliminating the wage discrepancy between H-1B employees and their American counterparts, and the diversity visa lottery system that awards visas to entry-level employees instead of high-skilled workers.  Likewise, the United States needs to encourage more students to participate in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education to help develop more high-tech American workers to complement those who enter our workforce on H-1B’s.  Combined, these actions will return the program to what it was originally intended to accomplish and encourage businesses to ‘hire American.’”   “The H-1B visa program is plagued by terrible policy, putting the needs of big corporations ahead of American workers,” said Congressman Jones.  “I want to thank Congressman Brooks and my colleagues once again for their efforts to institute major reforms to the H1-B program, and finally, put American workers first.”   The American Jobs First Act:   ·         Establishes salary requirements and standards that are either the greater of the annual wage paid to the U.S. employee who did similar work during the previous 2 years, or $110,000.  ·         Creates a “cooling off” between the time period by which employers are allowed to replace U.S. employees with foreign labor, thereby preventing H-1B visa program abuse aimed at displacing American workers.  ·         Creates greater transparency of job needs and opportunities in STEM fields.  ·         Would prevent the massive layoffs at companies such as Disney, where workers were forced to train their foreign replacements.","link","http://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=141","francisrooney.house.gov",58,21,8,2,0,1,0,0

This bill is a bad deal for the American people, which is why I voted against the measure.   “The fiscally irresponsible $1.07 trillion in spending for the next six months is $30 billion higher than the caps in the original Budget Control Act of 2011, and none of the spending increases are offset. Additionally, none of the $18 billion in proposed spending cuts in the President’s budget were included in this bill.   “The bill continues to send billions to sanctuary cities which violate federal immigration laws, while providing no funding for the border wall we need to secure our southern border. The bill also includes pro-abortion provisions, including continued funding for Planned Parenthood. Obamacare, a disastrous policy which has driven up the cost of healthcare while decreasing quality of care, continues to be funded. Additionally, the Department of Justice is prohibited from implementing federal law regarding marijuana, turning our country into a sanctuary nation.   “I will continue to fight against wasteful spending in Washington to make sure Americans’ hard-earned tax dollars are used better in the future.”   ###","link","http://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=146","francisrooney.house.gov",90,60,6,5,0,1,0,11

The tour will include House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. This tour is intended to highlight the importance of funding projects which have already been approved and designed.    Congressman Rooney stated “I would like to thank Majority Leader McCarthy for visiting our piece of paradise here in Southwest Florida. The best way to comprehend the beauty and importance of our Everglades and the Lake Okeechobee watershed is to see it first hand; and I am thankful to him for taking time away from his other responsibilities to be here.”  The Lake Okeechobee watershed and Everglades have far-ranging impact on the entire State of Florida and the country, but especially in Southeast and Southwest Florida, where 55% of all real estate in the state is affected - 2 trillion dollars of economic impact across 164 cities and 16 counties. CERP was enacted in 2000 and we need its 68 projects to be executed.  We also need the USACE to expedite needed repairs to the Herbert Hoover Dike. I look forward to showing Majority Leader McCarthy around the region, and hope that the visit underscores the importance of the Everglades to our country.”   Congressman Rooney has testified four times on water quality issues. In addition to this testimony, Congressman Rooney sent a letter to President Trump, co-signed by every member of the Florida Congressional delegation, that called on the President to support Everglades Restoration projects in his fiscal year 2018 Budget. Congressman Rooney is a member of the Everglades Caucus and the Estuary Caucus.  ###  http://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=150","link","http://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=150","francisrooney.house.gov",47,36,8,3,0,1,0,3

This is known as ""guaranteed issue,"" and it's mandated in the AHCA. No exceptions, no waivers. I spoke with an informed conservative news consumer earlier who was stunned to learn that this was the case, having been subjected to 24 hours of unhinged rhetoric from the Left.  Layer Two: Anyone with a pre-existing condition and who lives in a state that does not seek an optional waiver from the AHCA's (and Obamacare's) ""community rating"" regulation cannot be charged more than other people for a new plan when they seek to purchase one -- which, as established above, insurers are also required to sell them. Layer Three: Anyone who is insured and remains continuously insured cannot be dropped from their plan due to a pre-existing condition, and cannot be charged more after developing one. So if you've been covered, then you change jobs or want to switch plans, carriers must sell you the plan of your choice at the same price point as everyone else. Regardless of your health status. This is true of people in non-waiver and waiver states alike.  Layer Four: If you are uninsured and have a pre-existing condition and live in a state that pursued (and obtained after jumping through hoops) a ""community rating"" waiver, your state is required to give you access to a ""high risk pool"" fund to help you pay for higher premiums. The AHCA earmarks nearly $130 billion for these sorts of patient stability funds over ten years.

It only takes one hurricane to change your life and your community. Hurricanes are one of nature's most powerful and destructive events that the nation faces, and the cause behind eight of the ten costliest disasters in U.S. history. Hurricanes are not just a coastal concern. High winds, heavy rainfall, tornadoes, and flooding can be felt hundreds of miles inland, potentially causing loss of life and catastrophic damage to property.   Hurricane season begins June 1 and ends November 30. Now is the time to prepare, if you -- or a close family member -- live in an area prone to hurricanes or inland flooding. Make a family emergency communication plan. Don't forget to include your pets in your emergency preparedness planning. Identify an out of town emergency contact to coordinate information with family and friends. Keep an emergency kit where you spend time -- home, car, work. Download the FEMA app and set up local alerts for you or your loved ones. Practice your preparedness plans with a drill or exercise.

Being untreated, there are risks of nitrogen and phosphorous contamination as well as the harm resulting from the intrusion of salt water into fresh water estuaries in times of low discharges, like now, and from fresh water moving into salt water marshes and bays in times of high discharges, like last summer.  Many of the projects in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), when complete, will serve to reduce or eliminate these problems.   As  one can see by the reports from the Sanibel Captiva Conservation Foundation (SCCF)  below, current discharge levels are very low, averaging  357 CFS,  allowing salt water to damage the fresh water estuary, compared to discharges as high as 3,638 CFS in August.  A report from the Sanibel Captiva Conservation Foundation found below: ——————————————————  Report: April 25th – May 1 2017 Caloosahatchee Condition Summary: Freshwater flow into the estuary at S-79 during the past week averaged 357cfs. Inadequate freshwater is causing salinity to rise and continuing the Minimum Flow & Level (MFL) exceedance for 36 days at Fort Myers. Salinity is at lethal levels for tapegrass in the middle and upper estuary, and above the optimal range for oysters in the lower estuary. Cyanobacteria coverage increased upstream of S79 and the Alva Boat Ramp.   USACE Action: On April 28, 2017 the USACE reduced flows to the Caloosahatchee with a 7-day average target of 300 cfs measured at S-79. No discharge from Lake Okeechobee to the St Lucie estuary at S-80. ————————————————   Report: August 2016 Caloosahatchee Condition Summary: Discharges into the estuary at S-79 over the past week averaged 3,638 cfs, over the harm threshold of 2,800 cfs established for the estuary. Lake Okeechobee discharges to the river, measured at S-77, decreased to an average of 5,331 cfs. Watershed inflows to the Franklin pool between S-78 and S-79 during the past week averages 604 cfs.   USACE Action: On 10/21/16 the USACE decreased releases from Lake Okeechobee to 3,000 cfs to the Caloosahatchee measured at S-77 and 1,170 cfs to the St. Lucie measured at S-80.  http://sccf.org/downloadable-files/590a1947c57af681639ef1cd.pdf  http://sccf.org/water-quality/caloosahatchee-condition-reports","link","http://sccf.org/water-quality/caloosahatchee-condition-reports","sccf.org",25,21,2,0,0,0,1,4

To qualify for this exemption, an employee must work at an establishment “recognized as retail.”  In 1970, the Department of Labor (DOL) established a “blacklist” of industries arbitrarily blocked from the exemption, including travel agencies, with no accompanying notice that explained how those industries were chosen. The intent of the exemption was to cover services to the public, involving sales in small quantities and no manufacturing, provided by an employee in those establishments makes at least one and a half times the applicable minimum wage and in which more than half of the employee’s total earnings consist of commissions, a standard most travel agencies meet.   Congressman Rooney stated, “Eliminating harmful regulations on our small business community is a key component of economic growth and job creation. The idea that travel agencies “lack a retail concept” and therefore must be subject to federal overtime rules is arbitrary and overreaching. The exemption travel agencies are seeking is in line with similar industries and should be granted immediately.”  There are over 10,000 travel agents in Florida and the industry generates over $550 million in economic impact to the state economy. Travel agencies are predominantly small businesses, with 80% of agencies employing less than 5 people.  - See more at: http://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=162#sthash.l7UZfQbO.dpuf","link","http://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=162#sthash.l7UZfQbO.dpuf","francisrooney.house.gov",30,31,2,0,0,0,0,10

This year’s Military Academy Day will be held on Saturday, May 27th, from 8:30AM-11:30AM in the Cohen Center Ballroom, on the campus of Florida Gulf Coast University, 10501 FGCU Blvd S, Fort Myers, FL 33965. The event is free and open to all students, parents and guidance staff who are interested in learning more about the nation’s service academies.  Congressman Rooney stated, “It is an honor to be able to nominate outstanding young men and women to our nation’s military service academies. These schools offer a world-class education and provide leadership skills that will prepare these men and women for success in both military and civilian life.”  Each member of Congress may nominate up to ten individuals for each vacant academy slot allotted to their district. After nominations are submitted, each Service Academy selects which students will receive an appointment to attend.  The honor of attending a service academy comes with an obligation and commitment to serve in the military for a minimum of five years upon graduation.  Students applying to U.S. Service Academies require nominations from their federal representatives to be considered (The U.S. Coast Guard Academy does not require a congressional nomination for appointment).

As a non-hegemonic sovereign, the Holy See plays a unique role in world affairs through its use of the soft power diplomacy through moral persuasion that only it can exert. This gives the Holy See unparalleled influence in diplomacy and as a mediator in international disputes.     The United States and the Holy See have complemented each other in the past in combatting extremist ideologies, such as Nazism and communism, and on promoting human rights. From 2005-2008, I witnessed  this first-hand as United States Ambassador to the Holy See. President Bush and Pope Benedict XVI worked together on combatting human trafficking, AIDS in Africa, promoting religious freedom and in denouncing radical Islamic extremism.     The strength of this relationship depends on how highly each  president views the Holy See's soft power in world affairs. President Trump's choice to visit the Vatican on his first overseas trip is a good step toward a close relationship between the United States and the Holy See going forward.  https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2017/05/22/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E687-4","link","https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2017/05/22/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E687-4","congress.gov",29,26,2,3,0,0,1,8

The behavior of the United Nations contradicts its charter, which states the organization should promote ``better standards of life'' and ``international peace and security.''     If these are truly the goals of the United Nations, then why is the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a United Nations agency, preparing an international patent application for North Korean production of sodium cyanide, a substance used to make nerve gas that is banned from North Korea by the UN Security Council?     It is disturbing that the United Nations would grant legitimacy to North Korean production of a dangerous gas that can be used as a chemical weapon. Even more concerning is that the UN would do this during a time of escalating North Korean aggression, with its increasing illegal missile tests and threats of mass destruction. This action undermines sanctions against the unstable regime which threatens the very ``international security'' the UN claims to promote.    The United Nations must stop rewarding rogue regimes that undermine global security, or the United States must reconsider participation in this illegitimate body.","link","https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2017/05/22/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E689-2","congress.gov",51,12,5,0,0,0,0,6

This legislation would end the practice of organizing ‘micro-unions’, which allow labor officials to organize small groups of workers, often as few as 2-3 people, within a company rather than the entire workforce.  Congressman Rooney said, “Since the labor board’s decision, ‘micro-unions’ have begun to form in multiple retail stores and manufacturing sites across the country, making it nearly impossible for employers to manage such fragmentation of the workforce. In one case, the NLRB ruled that perfume and cosmetics salespeople at Macy’s, Inc. constituted their own ‘micro-union’ and could unionize alone. Imagine the confusion and cost as stockers, cashiers, shoe and clothing departments, etc., form their own unions at Macy’s.  Senator Isakson stated, “I have introduced this legislation every Congress since the National Labor Relations Board decided to tip the scales in favor of unions rather than allowing employees and managers within an organization to negotiate to best meet the needs of customers and workers alike,” said Isakson, chairman of the Senate labor subcommittee. “Common sense would tell you, and now experience has shown, that ‘micro-unions’ are a mistake, and I’m going to continue working to ensure that we have fair and equitable application of labor laws in the United States.”  The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) approved the first ‘micro-union’ in a 2011 decision known as Specialty Healthcare, which allowed labor officials to organize small groups of workers within a company rather than the entire workforce. The practice spread from healthcare to retail, manufacturing, telecommunications, and other industries. ‘Micro-unions’ allow unions to gain footholds in businesses where they otherwise lack enough worker support to have a regular union. The legislation would reinstate a 77-year-old standard for determining which groups of employees should constitute an appropriate bargaining unit. This is another example of the Obama Administration’s unfair and partisan decision-making that is affecting our workplace. Congressmen Bradley Byrne, Tom Cole, Drew Ferguson, Glenn Grothman, Jason Lewis, Lloyd Smucker and David Roe have joined with Congressman Rooney as co-sponsors.  ###     https://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=174","link","https://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=174","francisrooney.house.gov",31,22,4,2,0,0,1,10

Current policies restrict the ability of states to invest federal resources in efforts that prioritize economic growth and local needs. This occurs at a time when critical industries have vacant jobs but not enough qualified workers to fill them.  Congressman Rooney stated “Career and technical education is a key solution for the most critical needs of our economy. There are hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs that do not require a four-year degree. The pursuit of career and technical education will allow students to enter the workforce with usable skills that fulfill real world needs, without incurring tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt. CTE is a win for students, businesses and for our economy.”  Rooney continued, “Marine Concepts, a 40-year-old composite manufacturing company located within my district, is one example of why CTE is needed. This company provides several career paths with starting salaries that are nearly double the median salary of Lee County, yet these jobs require specific skills that college graduates do not possess. Career and technical education options will solve this worker shortage and provide immediate job opportunities to SWFL students.”    The CTE will accomplish the following:  ·         Empower state and local community leaders by simplifying the application process for receiving federal funds and providing more flexibility to use federal resources to respond to changing education and economic needs.  ·         Improve alignment with in-demand jobs by supporting innovative learning opportunities, building better community partnerships, and encouraging stronger engagement with employers.  ·         Increase transparency and accountability by streamlining performance measures to ensure CTE programs deliver results.  ###  https://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=192","link","https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2353","congress.gov",56,34,0,2,0,2,0,0

The focus on the tourism aspects of the deal are misplaced, as the real issue with our relationship with Cuba is capitalism and free enterprise versus communist socialism. Specifically, the Obama policy sought no commercial reforms and favored the Cuban regime over the Cuban people. President Trump's changes are meant to avoid commercially supporting the Cuban dictatorship by preventing transactions with GAESA, the military run enterprise that controls much of the Cuban economy.

In an age of heightened terror and radicalism, we must be able to ensure that those coming to our country will not seek to cause death and destruction in the name of any cause.

H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law, would impose enhanced criminal penalties for illegal aliens with serious criminal records that have been convicted of illegal entry and subsequently return to the United States.  H.R. 3003, No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, would provide for stricter penalties for jurisdictions that operate as sanctuary cities, including barring Department of Justice and Homeland Security grants from being allocated to sanctuary jurisdictions.   Congressman Rooney stated, “It is tragically too late to save the life of Kate Steinle, who was murdered by a 5-time deported criminal illegal alien with seven prior felony convictions. We must deter illegal immigrants who have been convicted and deported, from re-entering our country. This deterrent will protect our citizens and assist in preventing the loss of more innocent lives. In addition, the bill focuses on preventing highly organized and brutal gangs such as MS-13 from taking advantage of our immigration loopholes to traffic drugs and negatively influence our children.”  Congressman Rooney continued, “Today we have also taken action against rogue cities that refuse to respect federal law, yet believe they should be entitled to federal funding. Cities who refuse to uphold the law should not receive one penny of federal grant money. The safety and security of our communities are at stake.”  Background for H.R. 3004 and H.R. 3003:   Kate’s Law (H.R. 3004) – This bill protects public safety by enhancing penalties for deported felons who return to the United States. The bill is named after Kate Steinle, who was murdered in San Francisco by an unlawful immigrant who had previously been deported five times and was convicted of multiple felonies. In another tragic example, Nicodemo Coria-Gonzales—a criminal immigrant previously deported at least five times—is reportedly responsible for nearly a dozen sexual assaults. He allegedly kidnapped a woman and attempted to light her on fire using gasoline, and kidnapped and raped a 68-year old woman.  The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act (H.R. 3003) - This bill strengthens the law to combat dangerous sanctuary policies that shield unlawful and criminal immigrants from federal immigration enforcement.  • Provides More Tools to Fight Sanctuary Policies and Punish Rogue Cities: Specifically, the bill clarifies U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer authority—the tool used by federal immigration enforcement officers to pick up criminal aliens from local jails—by establishing statutory probable cause standards to issue detainers for the first time. It also withholds certain federal grants from jurisdictions that violate federal law by prohibiting their officers from communicating with ICE.  • Protects the Public from Dangerous Criminals: The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act also contains Sarah and Grant’s Law, which ensures unlawful immigrants convicted of drunk driving or arrested for other dangerous crimes are detained during their removal proceedings.   https://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=198","link","https://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=198","francisrooney.house.gov",165,50,7,17,0,1,4,19

For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov}  {A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficu;t or dangerous.}  -Maximum sustained winds are near 175 mph (280 km/h) with higher gusts.  Irma is a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are likely during the next day or two, but Irma is forecast to remain a powerful category 4 or 5  huricane during the next couple of days.  -Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km).   Gas stations are being resupplied as quickly as possible.   Getting power back up will be a major issue across the state, post storm.   Emergency supplies of water, food, generators, and cots are pre-positioned for fastest possible deployment following the storm.

All of these actions will take only a few minutes.  Take pictures of your property. Having this documentation now will help you with insurance and other inspectors later. First, take a picture of each room in your house.  Get exterior shots of your front and back yards, plus any other buildings on your property.  Photograph big-ticket items like large-screen TVs. Save these to a secure site, send them to a trusted friend or relative, or email them to yourself so they’re accessible even if you lose your camera or phone.  Scan your important documents. When disaster strikes, it’s common for folks to lose track of important papers. Scanning them now can make your recovery much easier and faster. Scan or take a picture of your lease or deed, vehicle titles, insurance policies, passport, driver’s license and other important papers.  Again, save these to a secure site, send them to a trusted friend or family member, or email to yourself. If your home is flooded, your phone or computer may get damaged, so it’s important to have those documents available online.     If you have a National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) flood policy, you may be eligible for reimbursement of actions taken to protect your property. Call your insurance agent to find out more.","status",NA,NA,16,4,2,0,0,0,0,0

Water pressures will be reduced in advance of the storm.   Customers who experience low water pressure or no water at any time during the event, will be under a boil water notice.   While under a boil water notice, water used for consumption can be disinfected by any one of the following methods:   ·         Bringing the water to a rolling boil and holding it there for one (1) minute, OR  ·         Using a disinfecting chemical. If you cannot boil water, you should put eight (8) drops of common household bleach (unscented) which is about one-eighth teaspoon, into one (1) gallon of tap water, then shake it, and allow it to stand for 30 minutes before drinking. If the water is cloudy, use sixteen (16) drops, about one-quarter teaspoon of bleach, shake it, and let it stand for 30 minutes. There should be a slight chlorine odor. Use common household bleach that has 5 percent to 8 percent active ingredients. Use food grade containers.  OR ·         Using water purification tablets or iodine that many sports and camping stores sell, and follow the directions on the package.   You can also buy commercial bottled water for consumption and food preparation as an alternative.   Consumption includes brushing teeth, washing fruits and vegetables, and homemade ice. Tap water may be used for showering, baths, shaving and washing, so long as care is taken not to swallow or allow water in eyes or nose or mouth. Children and disabled individuals should have their bath supervised to ensure water is not ingested. The time spent bathing should be minimized. Though the risk of illness is minimal, individuals who have recent surgical wounds, are immunosuppressed, or have a chronic illness may want to consider using bottled or boiled water (that has cooled) for cleansing until the notice is lifted.   Once the water has been tested and is safe to drink, Lee County Utilities will do a media advisory of when the boil water notice has been lifted.","status",NA,NA,24,4,28,1,0,0,0,0

While the worst of the winds are past us, this is still not over.  Tropical storm force winds will persist through about 3:00 AM.  Storm surge will peak over the next couple of hours.  The city will not have a handle on the extent of the damage until at least tomorrow afternoon. We will share traffic and re-entry information tomorrow as we begin to get officers deployed for traffic control and assess the damage in neighborhoods. We need YOUR HELP.  Please take a minute to read below and SHARE this post.  EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE STILL SUSPENDED AT THIS TIME. We will let the public know as soon as they have resumed. 9-1-1 will still take calls and add them to a queue. Calls will be triaged and will be responded to once operations have resumed.  CURFEW:  A county-wide curfew (Cape Coral included) is in effect starting TONIGHT from 8pm - 7am, until further notice. The curfew is meant to protect you from dangers that may not be evident during the daylight.  POST STORM SAFETY INFORMATION:  Don't return to your neighborhoods immediately after storm. There will be many dangers that first responders, public works, and debris management workers will have to assess and clear. This effort starts as soon as it is safe to get these crews on the road (likely tomorrow). Officials will communicate when it is safe to return to your neighborhoods. Avoid the urge to immediately leave your shelter and return to your neighborhoods.  TRAFFIC CONDITIONS/ROADWAYS:  Tropical storm force winds are still being experienced in Southwest Florida, so driving at this time is NOT advised.   POWER:  Most of the county remains without power (approximately 131,000 subscribers), including traffic signals.  As soon as it is safe to work again, the LCEC crews will begin working to restore power.  Visit www.lcec.net/reliability/storm-center/hurricane-updates for more information.  Please use caution if/when you begin generator use. DO NOT place it near a window or in the garage where deadly fumes can reach you. Do not operate in wet conditions.  If you are without power and use candles for illumination, please don't leave them unattended. Use extra caution to prevent fire from candle use, as your avenues of exit are now likely cut off by hurricane-shuttered windows.  WELFARE CHECKS:  We know that many people will want welfare check on friends and family.  Once the storm passes, roads are cleared, and immediate life-saving measures are done, THEN we will begin conducting welfare checks.  This may take 24-48 hours AFTER THE STORM PASSES.  Please call (239) 573-3000 for welfare check requests.  Please DO NOT call 9-1-1 or the non-emergency number for welfare checks, as they need to be available for emergency calls.    WEATHER:  Storm surge is projected to peak in the area over the next four hours. Flooding will continue to be an issue for the next several days. Please remain inside during the overnight hours, both for safety from ongoing weather and per the city curfew.    CANCELLATIONS AND CLOSURES:  Monday's (9/11) special and regular City Council meetings have been canceled.  City Hall is closed Monday (9/11) and Tuesday (9/12).  All Parks and Recreation programs through the weekend have been canceled.  Cape Coral Municipal Charter Schools and Lee County Schools are closed Monday (9/11) and Tuesday (9/12).

Now that the storm has passed, the recovery phase begins.  As you all begin to venture out this morning, please keep these things in mind:  *Treat all downed power lines as live! Call these in to us at (239) 656-2300; damage assessment has begun and crews are compiling the list of infrastructure that needs repair.  *Debris crews are actively clearing roadways. Give yourself extra time as your ""usual"" route may be blocked.  *Don't drive through standing water, as even only a small amount can sweep your car away. Initial reports have our flooding much, much better than had been anticipated, but there's still a lot of water out there.  *Generators are being placed at some key intersections throughout the city to power traffic lights. Other intersections are being modified to not allow for left-turns. If there is no signal or officer at the intersection and the light is out, PLEASE TREAT THE INTERSECTION AS A 4-WAY STOP.  *Midpoint Bridge and Cape Coral Bridge are still closed. Lee County is inspecting them today.  *Speaking of water, please don't play in it! Sewage, human waste, yard chemicals, dead animals, sharp debris from the storm...all things you don't want to wade in or get cut by.  *There is NO CITY-WIDE boil water notice for Cape Coral.  *We're reiterating generator safety. Run your generator OUTSIDE, away from windows, NOT under an overhang or in the garage where deadly fumes can reach you. Don't refuel a hot generator (gas can ignite) and don't operate a generator in wet conditions to avoid electrocution.  *If you've lost power (most of us have) and have no A/C, please stay hydrated. It's hot and sticky out there...it comes with the Florida living (like hurricanes).  We understand the urge to rush back and check the damage to your homes, but please have patience. Damage assessment and repair has already begun, and we will keep you updated on the safety and status of our roadways and bridges.","status",NA,NA,18,5,8,0,0,0,0,0

BSU water and wastewater plants suffered damage and service interruptions during the storm, but staff manning the plants throughout the storm maintained operations.   Damage assessment in our service area may take several days, and is made more difficult by extensive debris, flooding, power supply and access problems. Recovery efforts began as early as Sunday night with crews searching for water main breaks.  We ask our members to assist us by reporting water leaks they find to 239-992-0711.    Widespread power outages are impacting wastewater pump stations.  Stationary and portable generators are being used to maintain the system until electric service is restored.  Water and wastewater service remains out on Bonita Beach.   We are working hard to maintain water service in the rest of our service area, but damage in the distribution system is making that difficult.    We will keep customers updated on this developing issue.  We ask our customers to conserve water as much as possible, and use wastewater service sparingly until normal service is restored.   Communications may be subject to interruption.  We will respond to your calls as soon as we are able, so your patience is greatly appreciated.

First responders, federal teams and voluntary agencies are working tirelessly to help those in need through search and rescue, staffing emergency shelters, providing meals, and offering comfort.  Survivors should expect and prepare for significant, ongoing impacts, and disruptions to daily activities, and remember that returning home before storm debris is cleared is dangerous.  One of the largest power restoration efforts is underway with over 17,000 personnel activated through mutual aid agreements across the nation to support more than six (6) million residences without power.  The Department of Energy (DOE) is working closely with FEMA, tribal, territorial, state and local officials to conduct power assessments to support the electric industry as they begin the process of power restoration.  For those in designated areas in Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, registering online, at www.DisasterAssistance.gov<http://www.DisasterAssistance.gov>, is the quickest way to register for federal assistance, including FEMA assistance.  If you have a National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) flood policy, you may be eligible for reimbursement of actions taken to protect your property. Call your insurance agent to find out more.  To file a flood insurance claim under the NFIP, contact your insurance agent immediately. You can also call 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) – select option 2 – to learn more about your policy, and be directed to the appropriate claims resource.  Shelters remain open across the affected areas. Download the FEMA mobile app<https://www.fema.gov/mobile-app> (available in English and Spanish) for directions to open shelters and weather alerts from the National Weather Service.  FEMA may provide Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) to eligible disaster survivors who are unable to return to their homes for an extended period and need shelter. TSA provides short-term lodging for eligible disaster survivors whose residence is uninhabitable or inaccessible.  To be eligible for TSA, individuals and households must:      *   Register with FEMA for assistance.     *   Pass identity and citizenship verification.     *   Have a pre-disaster primary residence located in a geographic area that is designated for TSA.     *   Be displaced from their pre-disaster primary residence as a result of the disaster.     *   Be unable to obtain lodging through another source.  For those eligible, FEMA will authorize and fund TSA through direct payments to participating hotels/motels. The list of approved hotels is available at DisasterAssistance.gov<https://www.disasterassistance.gov/> or call the FEMA Helpline (800) 621-3362 (voice, 711/VRS-Video Relay Service) (TTY: (800) 462-7585).  The American Red Cross Safe and Well website<https://safeandwell.communityos.org/cms/index.php> is a free public reunification tool that allows individuals and organizations to register and post messages to indicate that they are safe, or to search for loved ones. Registrations can also be completed by texting SAFE to 78876. Messages exist in both Spanish and English. To speak with someone at the American Red Cross concerning a missing friend or relative, please contact 1-800 RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767).  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Disaster Distress Helpline (1-800-985-5990) remains open 24/7 for free help coping with the stress of the storm. To donate or volunteer, contact the voluntary or charitable organization of your choice through the National Voluntary Agencies Active in Disasters (NVOAD) at www.nvoad.org<http://www.nvoad.org>. In Florida, go to www.volunteerflorida.org<http://www.volunteerflorida.org/> or call 1-800-FL-Help-1.  For those who wish to help, cash donations offer voluntary agencies the most flexibility in obtaining the most-needed resources and pumps money into the local economy to help businesses recover.  FEMA and Federal Family Actions  More than 34,300 federal personnel are working in support of preparedness and response to Hurricane Irma, including more than 2,600 FEMA staff. Additional staff continue to deploy.  As of September 11, 2017, FEMA transferred approximately 2.4 million meals and 1.7 million liters of water to the state of Florida, at their request.   Mobile Emergency Response Support (MERS) assets and personnel are deployed to support communication needs in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.  Thirteen (13) Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMAT) are in Florida, with four more en route. DMATs are a rapid-response element to supplement local medical care, and deploy to disasters to provide medical care. Three Rapid Deployment Forces are also in Florida.  Safety and Preparedness  Stay off the roads. Emergency workers may be assisting people in flooded areas or cleaning up debris. You can help them by staying off the roads and out of the way. If your power is out, safely use a generator or candles.  o   Keep generators outside and far away from windows, doors and vents. Read both the label on your generator and the owner's manual and follow the instructions.  o   Never use a generator inside a home, basement, shed or garage even if doors and windows are open.  o   If using candles, please use caution. If possible, use flashlights instead. If you must use candles, do not burn them on or near anything that can catch fire.  Avoid plugging emergency generators into electric outlets or hooking them directly to your home's electrical system – they can feed electricity back into the power lines, putting you and line workers in danger.  Avoid downed power or utility lines; they may be live with deadly voltage. Stay away and report them immediately to your power or utility company.  Your phone is an important tool to ensure your family’s safety. Make sure to charge your phone and other electronic devices, as you may lose power for extended periods. A car charger is a handy backup to have so you don’t lose your ability to connect with family, friends and neighbors.  Declarations  Major Disaster Declaration   *   President Donald J.

Please use the following guidelines to ensure that debris can be removed from your residential property in the most timely and efficient manner. Businesses need to contact their insurer regarding property damage and clean up.   · Most Important – Storm debris should be placed at the curb and not in the roadway.  Placing debris in the roadway creates a hazard for traffic and emergency responders.  · Storm debris will be collected separately from your normal household trash and recycling so please keep it in separate piles.  · Regular household garbage collections have begun and will continue to proceed on the regularly scheduled collection days.   Recycling and yard waste are suspended and will resume at a later date.  · The Solid Waste Division’s storm debris crews may require several passes to collect all debris depending on the severity of the impact in your area.  Please monitor the news and the SWD website at leegov.com/solidwaste for detailed collection information for your specific area.  · Place debris at the curb in separate piles: garbage, yard waste, building debris, appliances, and other wastes. The Federal Emergency Management Agency requires documentation of the volume and type of debris collected to reimburse the county for storm clean up.  · Do not set household chemicals at the curb – those need to be taken to the Topaz Court Solid Waste Annex at 6441 Topaz Ct. Fort Myers, FL 33966. Mixing chemicals with your other debris creates a fire hazard.  · For the safety of the collection crews, do not place anything beneath low hanging obstacles like trees or power lines or near water meters, fire hydrants, mail boxes, and especially downed power lines.  · Household garbage must be placed in a 40-gallon can or heavy mil plastic bag each weighing no more than 50 pounds. If you have a larger county-provided container for automated garbage collection, you may use that as well.  · Yard waste from this storm event does not need to be bundled. Place it in piles that can easily be managed by debris collection personnel with a claw truck.  · Only debris generated by the storm event on maintained residential property is eligible for collection. Land clearing debris from unimproved or unmaintained land is not eligible for collection and is the responsibility of the property owner.  · Food must be removed from any appliance set at the curb. Inedible food should be properly containerized or bagged and placed with the garbage.   About the Solid Waste Division – The Lee County Solid Waste Division is a nationally-recognized enterprise system providing residents and businesses safe, affordable waste disposal and recycling services. The system utilizes an energy-from-waste combustion process to create clean, renewable energy and single-stream recycling for material recovery.

Although many Americans are working hard to help their neighbors now, during chaotic times, some will always try to take advantage of the most vulnerable.  To dispel some of the false rumors circulating on the internet and social media, FEMA has a dedicated website to address some of the most common themes. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Visit https://www.fema.gov/hurricane-irma-rumor-control to get the most accurate information from trusted sources.  Here are a few guidelines to protect yourself, or someone you care about, from disaster fraud:  Federal and state workers do not ask for, or accept, money. FEMA staff will never charge applicants for disaster assistance, home inspections, or help filling out applications. Stay alert for false promises to speed up the insurance, disaster assistance, or building permit process.   In person, always ask to see any FEMA employee ID badges. FEMA Disaster Survivor Assistance teams may be in impacted communities providing information and assisting survivors with the registration process or their applicant files.   A FEMA shirt or jacket is not proof of identity. All FEMA representatives, including our contracted inspectors, will have a laminated photo ID. All National Flood Insurance Program adjusters will have a NFIP Authorized Adjuster Card with their name and the types of claims they may adjust.   If you are unsure or uncomfortable with anyone you encounter claiming to be an emergency management official, do not give out personal information, and contact local law enforcement.   If you suspect fraud, contact the National Center for Disaster Fraud’s hotline at 1-866-720-5721, or email the organization at disaster@leo.gov. You can also report fraud to the Federal Trade Commission at www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov.  Learn more about the National Center for Disaster Fraud at www.justice.gov/disaster-fraud.    In Florida, disaster-related fraud information is available on the State Attorney General’s Office website at www.MyFloridaLegal.com, or by calling the office at 1-866-966-7226. Hurricane survivors are also encouraged to notify local authorities to cases of lawlessness or violence, especially in hurricane shelters. In an emergency, call 9-1-1. For other cases: In Florida, report suspicious/criminal activity to 1-855-352-7233.","link","http://www.myfloridalegal.com/","myfloridalegal.com",41,4,35,0,0,1,0,0

At Irma's peak on September 11, there were 7.8 million outages. There are 60,000 workers currently assisting in electricity restoration efforts.   While it is no consolation to those who are still without power, customers should know that crews from across the United States and Canada are working around the clock to support Irma restoration efforts.   How is power restored following a storm like Irma? There are six steps to the restoration process:  1. Power plants are assessed for damage and restored. 2. High-voltage transmission lines serving thousands of customers over wide areas are repaired. 3. Substations are brought online in order for power to reach local distribution lines. 4. Power is restored to emergency responders and essential services critical to public health and safety such as hospitals, fire and police departments, and water systems. 5. Crews are dispatched to repair lines that will return service to the largest number of customers in the least amount of time. Service lines to neighborhoods, industries, and businesses are restored systematically. 6. Once major repairs are completed, service lines to individual homes and smaller groups of customers are restored. In some cases, customers may not be able to receive power to their homes because of damage.  While customers may not see lineworkers in their neighborhoods, it's important to remember that the energy grid is heavily interconnected and the equipment that needs to be repaired—or what's causing the outage—may be located in another area of the system. If energy infrastructure must be rebuilt in order to restore power, this could delay restoration times.","status",NA,NA,37,14,24,4,0,3,0,1

Commercially prepared cans of food should not be eaten if there is a bulging or opening on the can or screw caps, soda bottle tops or twist-caps. Undamaged, commercially canned foods can be saved if labels are removed and cans are disinfected in a bleach solution. Use 1/4 cup of bleach in 1 gallon of water; re-label the cans including expiration date and type of food. Assume that home-canned food is unsafe.  Infants should preferably be breast fed or fed only pre-mixed canned baby formula. Do not use powdered formulas prepared with untreated water, use boiled water instead. When the power is out, refrigerators will keep foods cool for approximately 4 hours. Thawed and refrigerated foods should be thrown out after 4 hours.    Sanitation and Hygiene: Preventing Waterborne Illness  Basic hygiene is very important during this emergency period. Always wash your hands with soap and water.  Use only water that has been boiled or disinfected for washing hands before eating, after toilet use, after helping in cleanup activities and after handling items contaminated by floodwater or sewage. Flood water may contain fecal matter from sewage systems, agricultural and industrial waste and septic tanks. If you have open cuts or sores exposed to the floodwater, keep them as clean as possible by washing them with soap and disinfected or boiled water. Apply antibiotic cream to reduce the risk of infection. If a wound or sore develops redness, swelling or drainage, see a physician. Do not allow children to play in floodwater. They can be exposed to water contaminated with fecal matter.  Do not allow children to play with toys that have been in floodwater until the toys have been disinfected. Use 1/4 cup of bleach in 1 gallon of water to disinfect toys and other items.    Power Outages: Preventing Fire Hazards  Using battery-powered lanterns and flashlights is preferred. NEVER use candles.    Post Flood Clean-up  Clean up debris carefully to avoid injury and contamination.  Chainsaws should only be operated in safe conditions (not in water soaked areas) and by people who are experienced in proper use. Lift heavy debris by bending knees and using legs to help lift.  Wear shoes to avoid injury to the feet from glass, nails or other sharp objects. Avoid contact with downed power lines. Be alert to wildlife (snakes, alligators, etc.) that may have been displaced as a result of the flood or storm. If you see a snake or other wildlife, back away from it slowly and do not touch it. If the snake is in your home, immediately call the animal control agency in your county.    Clearing Standing Water: Preventing Mosquito-borne Illness  Heavy rains and flooding can lead to an increase in mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are most active at sunrise and sunset.    DRAIN standing water to stop mosquitoes from multiplying.  ·         Drain water from garbage cans, house gutters, buckets, pool covers, coolers, toys, flower pots or any other containers where sprinkler or rain water has collected.  ·         Discard old tires, drums, bottles, cans, pots and pans, broken appliances and other items that aren't being used.  ·         Empty and clean birdbaths and pet's water bowls at least once to twice a week. Protect boats and vehicles from rain with tarps that don’t accumulate water.  ·         Maintain swimming pools in good condition and keep appropriately chlorinated. Empty plastic swimming pools when not in use.     COVER skin with clothing or repellent.  Clothing - Wear shoes, socks, and long pants and long-sleeves. This type of protection may be necessary for people working in areas where mosquitoes are present. Repellent - Apply mosquito repellent to bare skin and clothing. See Tips on Repellent Use below for additional instructions related to children. Always use repellents according to the label. Repellents with DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, and IR3535 are effective. Use mosquito netting to protect children younger than 2 months old.    COVER doors and windows with screens to keep mosquitoes out of your house.  Repair broken screening on windows, doors, porches, and patios.    Tips on Eliminating Mosquito Breeding Sites  Clean out eaves, troughs and gutters. Remove old tires or drill holes in those used in playgrounds to drain. Turn over or remove empty plastic pots. Pick up all beverage containers and cups. Check tarps on boats or other equipment that may collect water. Pump out bilges on boats. Replace water in birdbaths and pet or other animal feeding dishes at least once a week. Change water in plant trays, including hanging plants, at least once a week. Remove vegetation or obstructions in drainage ditches that prevent the flow of water.    Tips on Repellent Use  Always read label directions carefully for the approved usage before you apply a repellent. Some repellents are not suitable for children. Products with concentrations of up to 30 percent DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) are generally recommended. Other U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-approved repellents contain picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or IR3535. These products are generally available at local pharmacies. Look for active ingredients to be listed on the product label. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin, or onto clothing, but not under clothing. In protecting children, read label instructions to be sure the repellent is age-appropriate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mosquito repellents containing oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be used on children under the age of three years. DEET is not recommended on children younger than two months old. Avoid applying repellents to the hands of children. Adults should apply repellent first to their own hands and then transfer it to the child’s skin and clothing. If additional protection is necessary, apply a permethrin repellent directly to your clothing. Again, always follow the manufacturer’s directions.

The program, named Operation Blue Roof, provides a temporary covering of blue plastic sheeting to help reduce further damage to property until permanent repairs can be made. The blue plastic sheeting is installed using strips of wood that are secured to the roof with nails or screws.  Only primary residences that have standard shingled roofs are eligible to receive a temporary blue roof. Metal roofs and mobile homes will be repaired as practical on a case by case basis, and roofs with greater than 50 percent structural damage are not eligible for this program.  This program is available at no cost to eligible primary homeowners in Charlotte, Collier, Hillsborough, Lee, Manatee, Miami-Dade, Monroe, Pinellas, and Sarasota, counties. Renters must obtain legal permission to continue occupying the residence until more permanent repairs are made.  Homeowners must sign a Right of Entry (ROE) form to allow government employees and contractors onto their property to assess damage and install the temporary covering. ROE collection centers will be set up by Corps teams in convenient neighborhood locations. Updated information about collection center locations in each county will be distributed daily.

Scott: Disaster Relief Employment Available to Floridians Affected by Hurricane Irma   Today, Governor Rick Scott announced the state has been awarded federal Dislocated Worker Grants to provide temporary employment to Floridians affected by Hurricane Irma. The Dislocated Worker Grants, administered by the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, provide disaster relief employment in the form of temporary jobs that support storm response and recovery efforts.  Governor Scott said, “As we all recover from Hurricane Irma, we are doing everything we can to help Floridians get back on their feet. This federal funding will provide important employment opportunities to Floridians who may have lost their jobs due to the impacts of this massive storm and will also support ongoing recovery efforts. Now, Floridians can get back to work helping those in their communities. We will continue to work together to make sure everyone has the support they need to rebuild.”  Disaster relief employment pertains to projects that provide food, clothing, shelter and other humanitarian assistance for disaster victims and projects that involve demolition, cleaning, repair, renovation and reconstruction of damaged structures and facilities. Individuals who qualify for disaster relief employment are people who are temporarily or permanently laid off as a consequence of the disaster, dislocated workers, and individuals who are long-term unemployed.  DEO Executive Director Cissy Proctor said, “DEO is working with local CareerSource Florida workforce boards across the state to connect dislocated job seekers with cleanup opportunities. We will continue to use these grants and all other resources we have available to help communities fully recover from Hurricane Irma.”  For information regarding National Dislocated Worker Grants, visit your local CareerSource Center at http://www.careersourceflorida.com/your-local-team.  In addition to the Dislocated Worker Grants, DEO is also providing the following programs to assist in recovery from Hurricane Irma:  The Florida Small Business Emergency Bridge Loan Program provides cash flow to businesses damaged by a disaster. The short-term, interest-free loans help bridge the gap between the time damage is incurred and when a business secures other financial resources, including payment of insurance claims or longer-term Small Business Administration loans. Go to www.floridadisasterloan.org for more information. DEO is currently surveying businesses in affected counties to determine damage. To access the business survey, please go to http://flvbeoc.org/index.php?action=bda and select “Hurricane Irma” from the drop-down menu. The Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) Program provides assistance to businesses and residents whose employment or self-employment was lost or interrupted as a result of Hurricane Irma. To apply for DUA, go to www.floridajobs.org or call the Florida Disaster Unemployment Assistance Line at 1-800-385-3920. ###","link","http://www.flgov.com/2017/09/20/gov-scott-disaster-relief-employment-available-to-floridians-affected-by-hurricane-irma/","flgov.com",20,3,14,1,0,0,0,0

Trump issued a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of Florida triggering the release of Federal funds to help people and communities recover from Hurricane Irma. After much discussion with local officials and federal agencies, this disaster declaration has now been amended. The President has approved a 90 percent Federal cost share for debris removal, for a period of 30 days from the date of the declaration. The 90 percent reimbursement is a 15 percent increase from originally approved levels, and is in line with requests from city and county officials.  Congressman Rooney stated, “I have been in constant contact with The White House, FEMA, and leaders from state and local governments, in an effort to take the burden of Hurricane Irma recovery off the backs of our cities and counties. I thank President Trump for understanding the necessity of this reimbursement and for his continual engagement on Florida’s recovery efforts. While we were together touring the devastation in Collier and Lee County, his engagement and compassion provided encouragement to many.”  All counties and Indian Tribes in the State of Florida are eligible to apply for assistance under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program.

Florida NFIP policyholders have received more than $36 million in payments.  The U.S. Small Business Administration’s (SBA) low-interest disaster loans are the primary source of federal assistance to rebuild disaster-damaged property. SBA offers low-interest disaster loans to businesses of all sizes, private nonprofit organizations, homeowners and renters. As of Oct. 1, SBA has approved 238 loans for more than $10.6 million in Florida. As of September 30, 442 Requests for Public Assistance received by the state. The deadline to submit RPAs has been extended to November 10, 2017.   What You Can Expect After Applying for FEMA Individual Assistance  -Housing inspectors contracted by FEMA are working in disaster-designated counties, inspecting damage sustained by survivors who have already registered with FEMA.  -The damage inspection generally lasts 20-45 minutes.  -Inspectors document disaster-related damage, but do not determine the applicant’s eligibility for FEMA assistance.  -They check for damage to the structure and building systems, to major appliances and septic systems and wells, and enter information into an electronic device that sends the information to FEMA. This speeds up the process of providing assistance.   Tips for disaster survivors: ·         Start repairs to make your home safe and livable again. Be sure to get a building permit from your local building department before starting structural work. ·         Clean up debris as soon as possible. Do not wait for a flood insurance adjuster or FEMA home inspector to come to your home. ·         The NFIP advises policyholders to proceed with debris removal once it is safe to re- enter the structure. Take photos or videos of the outside and inside of the building, including damaged personal property, and label them by room before you remove anything; Photograph the make, model and serial number of items like washers and dryers, hot water heaters, kitchen appliances, TVs and computers; Keep samples of carpet, flooring, wallpaper, drapes, etc.; Separate damaged from undamaged personal property items to show the adjuster; After taking photos, immediately throw away flooded items that pose a health risk, such as perishable food, clothing, cushions and pillows.   Disaster Recovery Centers and Other Sources of Registration Assistance and Updates: ·         We encourage survivors to register online before visiting a Disaster Recovery Center, where they can receive an update on their application and ask questions about the assistance process.

Operation Blue Roof Eligible homeowners in 29 counties who sustained roof damage from Hurricane Irma can apply for Operation Blue Roof and complete the Right of Entry (ROE) form that allows government employees and contractors onto their property to assess damage and install a temporary covering to help reduce further damage to property until permanent repairs can be made. Operation Blue Roof provides a temporary covering of blue plastic sheeting to help reduce further damage to property until permanent repairs can be made. The blue plastic sheeting is installed using strips of wood that are secured to the roof with nails or screws. Only primary residences with standard shingled roofs are eligible to receive a temporary blue roof. Metal roofs and mobile homes may be repaired as practical on a case by case basis. Roofs with greater than 50 percent structural damage are not eligible for this program. Homeowners must sign a Right of Entry (ROE) form to allow government employees and contractors onto their property to assess damage and install the temporary covering. ROE collection centers are open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., seven days a week unless otherwise noted. A list of open ROE locations can be found on the USACE Jacksonville District websites at www.saj.usace.army.mil/BlueRoof or www.saj.usace.army.mil/blueroof_espanol/ and at 1-888-ROOF-BLU (1-888-766-3258). Information is provided in both English and Spanish. As of Oct. 1, 1120 temporary roofs have been installed. The deadline to apply is October 13, 2017.   Disaster Unemployment Disaster Unemployment helps workers whose primary incomes are lost or interrupted by a federally declared disaster. It differs from regular state unemployment insurance because it provides benefits to people who are self-employed, farmers, loggers and employees who work on commission. Individuals in the 48 counties designated for Individual Assistance in Florida must first apply for regular unemployment insurance by visiting the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity website.  Legal Services Free legal assistance is now available to low-income Florida disaster survivors in the 48 IA- designated counties who need help with home repair contracts and contractors, legal advice on landlord-tenant issues or assistance with life, medical and property insurance claims. For more information, visit flcourts.org.   Mortgage Help for Homeowners Hurricane Irma survivors whose home or place of employment was affected should contact their mortgage companies right away to discuss their mortgage relief options.  Those affected are eligible to temporarily stop making their monthly mortgage payment for up to 12 months. At the end of the temporary payment break, homeowners:  Won’t have late fees.  Won’t have delinquencies reported to the credit bureaus.  Won’t have to catch up on all of their payments at once.  Can work with their servicer to resume making a mortgage payment that is similar to what they paid before the disaster.   Or if they need additional assistance, they can work with their servicer on options to keep their home.  Homeowners need to contact their mortgage servicer (the company where they send their monthly payments) as soon as possible to let them know about their current circumstances. The telephone number and mailing address of their mortgage servicer should be listed on their monthly mortgage statement. They also can look it up on the Mortgage Bankers Association website at www.mba.org/news-research-and- resources/hurricane-relief. If they are having difficulty contacting their mortgage servicer, they should contact the Homeowner’s HOPE™ Hotline at 1-888-995-HOPE (4673) for assistance and FREE confidential support from a HUD-approved housing counselor.

The Congressman is a cosponsor of this legislation, which restricts abortions 20 weeks or more after fertilization. Specifically, H.R. 36 establishes criminal penalties for any person who performs or attempts an abortion on a baby after the 20-week mark. In addition, this bill provides exceptions to save the life of the mother, and in the case of rape or incest.   Congressman Rooney stated. “Science has proven that unborn children of 20 weeks are capable of feeling pain, yet thousands of these babies are murdered each year in late-term abortions. I am hopeful the Senate will follow suit with passage, and send this life-saving legislation to the President’s desk to be signed in to law. Performing an abortion 20 weeks into a pregnancy is perverse and immoral, and must be made illegal. I will always support the sanctity of life.”  Currently, America is one of only seven countries worldwide who allow elective late-term abortions. A majority of Americans from across the political spectrum support this commonsense restriction on abortion after 20 weeks. This bill would give millions of unborn children a chance to live. To protect these unborn children from this horrific procedure, the House has passed H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act of 2017.  ###","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepRooney/photos/a.754691278011680.1073741828.749310315216443/926752007472272/?type=3",NA,133,66,17,21,2,0,0,31

The bill, H.R. 3957, would repeal Title VIII of the Higher Education Opportunity Act. This repeal will remove the ability to fund dozens of special interest programs, resulting in smaller government and less spending.     Congressman Rooney stated. “Eliminating waste and cutting government spending is one of the main reasons the voters sent me to Washington. Title VIII established numerous narrowly focused carve-outs and special interest programs that, although currently not funded, have been appropriated and are on the books.

The text of the letter follows below:  Dear Mr. President,  We write to express our gratitude for declaring a ninety percent federal cost share for Hurricane Irma debris removal. This federal assistance has made a tremendous impact in allowing our communities to begin the recovery and rebuilding efforts.  Yet, debris remains a hazard for public safety and first responders. That is why we request the ninety percent federal cost share be extended for an additional thirty days.  Our communities have been working around the clock since September 10th to rebuild and restore our neighborhoods, business, and schools. Given the significant state-wide impact, many local municipalities are still recovering and removing large quantities of debris.  The speed of removing the debris is of concern for public safety, local budgets, and recovery efforts.  While our communities have made major strides, we are far from a full recovery.  These factors are why an extension of the ninety percent federal reimbursement for an additional thirty days is crucial for recovery efforts.  Thank you again for your rapid assistance in preparing and responding to Hurricane Irma.  Your consideration of an extension is much appreciated.

Starting Saturday, Oct. 14, sites will be added on Pine Island and in central Fort Myers. That brings the total to five sites at which people can dump their own yard-waste debris if they do not want to wait for the contracted hauler to come to their street. Hours are 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. seven days a week. There is no charge.   New sites to open Saturday:   ·         Pine Island: 7630 Stringfellow Road, St. James City, 33956.  ·         Central Fort Myers: 4551 S. Cleveland Ave., Fort Myers, 33907.  Existing sites:   ·         Estero: 21651Via Coconut Point, Estero, 33928. Note: This is located at Estero Community Park, but do not use the park’s main entrance; use the maintenance compound entrance at this address.  ·         East Lee County: Lee County Mosquito Control, Sunset Road just east of Gunnery Road, Buckingham, 33971.  ·         Southwest Fort Myers: 14790 A & W Bulb Road, Fort Myers, 33908.   You must show ID and be a resident of Bonita Springs, Fort Myers Beach, Estero or unincorporated Lee County. You can bring the horticultural debris from your residential site for free.   For more information related to Hurricane Irma, including daily updates on debris collection, log on to www.leegov.com/irma. This is a newly enhanced website the county has created to help residents garner up-to-date post-Irma information on topics including storm debris, parks, libraries, public transportation, Federal Emergency Management Agency links and tips on getting permits for recovery repairs. There is an interactive map showing where debris crews are working. The map – also viewable on mobile phones – is updated to show the next planned area where trucks will arrive. The site also features daily updates showing the volume of debris collected.  Check the website for a map and directions to drop-off sites. Residents can visit public sites as many times as desired. People must unload their own vehicles. Residents who hire someone, including commercial landscaping crews, to clear their property must complete a Hurricane Irma Storm Debris Self-Haul Form, which is available on the website. The public sites are for residential storm debris only.","link","http://www.leegov.com/irma","leegov.com",11,2,1,0,0,0,0,1

Disaster assistance is available to eligible individuals and households in the 48 disaster-designated counties with storm-related damages between Sept. 4 through Oct. 18, 2017. Survivors who suffered losses between those dates are encouraged to register as soon as possible. The deadline to apply for assistance is November 24th, 2017    Hurricane survivors should register for assistance even if they have insurance. FEMA cannot duplicate insurance payments, but underinsured applicants may receive help after their claims have been settled.   Applying for disaster assistance is a two-step process that ensures consideration for all FEMA programs and the U.S. Small Business Administration low-interest disaster loans. First, register with FEMA. Then complete and return the SBA loan application, if referred to the SBA.     The quickest way to apply for federal assistance is online at www.disasterassistance.gov. Survivors may also apply by phone at 800-621-3362 (Voice, 711 or VRS) or 800-462-7585 (TTY). Due to high demand, lines may be busy during the day. Try calling in the morning or evening when call volume may be lower.

The Army Corps of Engineers was scheduled to complete a $1.7 billion renovation of the dike in 2025, but Congressman Rooney, Governor Scott, and other elected officials have led efforts for an expedited timeline with completion by 2022.  Congressman Rooney stated, “I am thankful for President Trump’s commitment to expediting dike repairs and look forward to continuing to work with the Administration, Governor Scott, and local stakeholders to bring this project to completion. The dike is a safety and flood control issue that effects thousands of Florida residents.”  Congressman Rooney continued, “Funding dike repairs, along with completing already approved CERP projects, has been my top priority.” In the House, we were successful in achieving the highest level of federal funding ever for dike repairs in the FY 2018 appropriations bill. Bringing all concerned parties together in a united effort has been critical to our success and will be necessary as we move forward with securing appropriations that will finally fix our water quality issues.”  The Herbert Hoover Dike, which surrounds Lake Okeechobee and provides flood protection to South Florida, was identified by the Army Corps in the early 2000s to be at high risk of failure and in need of repairs to address significant dam safety and stability issues.","link","https://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=263","francisrooney.house.gov",103,28,13,7,0,0,0,4

The first step is to obtain any necessary permits and follow all local building codes when rebuilding or making repairs. Contact your local code officials before beginning any construction to ensure you will meet all local building requirements.   There are resources available to help you build back stronger and safer after a disaster. Next to insurance, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is the primary source of money for the long-term rebuilding of your disaster-damaged private property.   You also may be eligible for assistance to rebuild stronger and safer if you have a National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) policy. Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC) may provide additional funding to help you repair or rebuild your home.   SBA Low-interest Disaster Loans   After registering with FEMA, you may apply for an SBA low-interest disaster loan. Go online using the Electronic Loan Application via SBA’s secure website at https://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela. You also may visit a FEMA disaster recovery center and meet with an SBA representative in person. To locate the nearest center, call the FEMA Helpline at 800-621-3362, use the FEMA app for smart phones or go online to www.fema.gov/DRC.   The filing deadline to return applications for physical property damage is Nov. 24, 2017.   If SBA determines you are eligible for a loan, you are under no obligation to accept it.    SBA Mitigation Loans If you accept a low-interest disaster loan, you may be eligible for additional funds from SBA to cover the cost of improvements that will protect your property against future damage. Examples of mitigation improvements include retaining walls, seawalls, sump pumps, and even safe rooms and storm shelters. SBA mitigation loan money would be in addition to the amount of the approved low-interest disaster loan, but may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of physical damage to real property, as verified by SBA, to a maximum of $200,000 for home loans. SBA approval of the mitigating measures will be required before any loan increase.   Increased Cost of Compliance If you have a NFIP flood insurance policy and a substantially damaged building in a Special Flood Hazard Area you may be able to use additional funds from your policy (up to $30,000) to help defray the costs of elevating, relocating or demolishing a structure to bring the building into compliance with state or community floodplain management laws or ordinances. This funding is known as Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC).   Substantial damage is a term used by NFIP. You should contact your local building official to find out why or how a substantial damage determination was made on a structure affected by Hurricane Irma.   Your claims adjuster or insurance agent will be able to provide more information on ICC. You may also get details online at Increased Cost of Compliance Coverage: How You Can Benefit.   You may register for FEMA assistance before Nov. 24, 2017 in one of the following ways: Online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov or through the FEMA App. If you don’t have Internet access, you can call 800-621-3362. People who have a speech disability or hearing loss and use TTY should call 800-462-7585. For those who use 711 or Video Relay Service (VRS), call 800-621-3362.

Congressman Rooney stated “Designating drug traffickers as ‘Kingpins’ is a key to United States national security, and is a strong tool to combat the narcotics trade in the Western Hemisphere. Kingpin designations have successfully been used to sanction drug traffickers in Latin America. The Act has targeted the FARC in Colombia, and major drug cartels and their leaders in Mexico.”  Rooney continued “The Act has been recently used to target members of the Maduro regime in Venezuela who engage in the illicit narcotics trade, and support Hezbollah, an Islamic terrorist group. The strongest use of the Kingpin Act occurred in February 2017, when the United States Department of the Treasury designated Venezuelan Vice President Tareck el-Aissami and his associate Samark Lopez as drug traffickers, freezing their access to an estimated $3 billion. As Maduro’s corrupt regime and its members continue to suppress democracy, commit human rights abuses and support terrorist groups, the United States and other democracies should continue to apply pressure on the Venezuelan government.”  The Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, better known as the Kingpin Act, was enacted in 1999 to combat narcotics trafficking and deny dealers and cartels access to the United States financial system. Currently, 65 individuals and 16 organizations connected to the Western Hemisphere are designated under Tier 1 of the Act, which is used to sanction those of significant concern regarding narcotics trafficking.","link","https://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=269","francisrooney.house.gov",25,12,2,0,0,1,0,1

This bill provides these affordable options for our community, while making it possible to inject private sector competition into the market to lower overall rates.”  Florida has been a “donor state” to the NFIP for decades, paying 27% of the program’s annual premiums while only accounting for 7.3% of the dollars paid in claims since 1978; and the counties of Collier and Lee have paid 4.8% of the premiums but involved only 0.18% of the claims over that same period.  Recap of H.R. 2874     -Reauthorizes NFIP for 5 years -Authorizes $1 Billion to elevate, buyout, or mitigate high risk properties -Caps flood insurance premiums at $10,000 for homeowners -Continues practice of “grandfathering” properties -Continues to allow for coverage of new construction -Removes barriers to private flood ins market (creating potential for better coverage at lower costs than NFIP) – It is estimated that 77% of FL properties would see lower premiums in the private market -Addresses repeatedly flooding properties. These properties account for 2% of NFIP policies, but 25% of claims. -Works to make NFIP solvent in the future","link","https://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=272","francisrooney.house.gov",54,20,3,1,0,0,0,1

This legislation seeks to motivate students to graduate within six years. If students are not able to complete their degree within six years, this act would compel them to repay the grant in the form of an unsubsidized Stafford Loan.  This act will focus efforts of both colleges and students to complete their degrees in a timely manner as well as bring forth more bang for the taxpayer’s buck. It is important for Pell Grants to be accessible to students who need them, and are committed to graduating and joining the workforce.  Background: Pell Grants are a vital option for low-income students who seek an affordable college education. 46% percent of students who attend a public university are awarded the Pell Grant, and many students for various reasons find themselves languishing and not graduating in a timely manner. In fact, 37% of students do not graduate within six years.  Students obtain Pell Grants through the Federal Pell Grant program with few strings attached.  The program lacks a mechanism to make sure colleges and the student are focused on graduating students on time and completing their degrees. The program is currently funded at $22.47 billion with students receiving 82% more in grants than a decade ago. Unfortunately, the increase in Pell Grant spending is a contributing factor in driving up college tuitions by 64% for public universities, thus impacting the affordability for all students. Sadly, in its current state the Pell Grant program fails both the student and ultimately the taxpayer.  https://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=273","link","https://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=273","francisrooney.house.gov",59,51,9,1,0,1,3,24

Only those Veterans with honorable service will be able to apply for the ID card, which will provide proof of military service, and may be accepted by retailers in lieu of the standard DD-214 form to obtain promotional discounts and other services where offered to Veterans.  “The new Veterans Identification Card provides a safer and more convenient and efficient way for most Veterans to show proof of service,” said VA Secretary Dr. David J. Shulkin. “With the card, Veterans with honorable service to our nation will no longer need to carry around their paper DD-214s to obtain Veteran discounts and other services.”  The VIC provides a more portable and secure alternative for those who served the minimum obligated time in service, but did not meet the retirement or medical discharge threshold. Veterans who served in the armed forces, including the reserve components, and who have a discharge of honorable or general (under honorable conditions) can request a VIC. To request a VIC, Veterans must visit vets.gov, click on “Apply for Printed Veteran ID Card” on the bottom left of the page and sign in or create an account.  Veterans who apply for a card should receive it within 60 days and can check delivery status of their cards at vets.gov.

Congressman Rooney stated, “A person’s right to carry a lawfully purchased weapon should not end at their state border. This common-sense legislation will ensure that people can protect themselves and their families, as our Constitution intended.”  Summary:  • Protects Americans’ Constitutional Rights: The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act ensures that law-abiding citizens’ Second Amendment right does not end when they cross state lines. The bill allows people with a state issued concealed carry license or permit, or individuals who are citizens of states that do not require a permit to carry a concealed firearm, to carry a concealed handgun in any other state that allows concealed carry, as long as the individual follows the laws of that state.  • Enhances Public Safety: The facts show that citizens who carry a concealed handgun are not only better prepared to act in their own self-defense, but also in the defense of others. A 2013 peer-reviewed study in Applied Economic Letters, found that between 1980 and 2009, “states with more restrictive concealed carry laws had gun-related murder rates that were 10% higher.”  Additionally, a 2013 survey of 15,000 current and retired police officers found that more than 90% of them support the concealed carry of guns by civilians.  • Does Not Arm Criminals: This bill will continue current law as it relates to criminals who are already prohibited from obtaining a firearm.","status",NA,NA,243,89,25,21,1,0,3,53

The world is changing rapidly and our education system must have the tools and flexibility to respond to these changes; the status quo isn’t working.”   The Higher Education Act:   • Strengthens Workforce Development: The bill expands opportunities for students by reforming the federal work-study program, allowing students to use federal student aid for shorter-term programs that will get them into the workforce quicker, and encouraging partnerships between colleges and industry to expand opportunities.   • Increases ‘Earn and Learn’ options: The bill allocates $183 million to community colleges for apprenticeship programs of up to two years.   • Streamlines Student Aid: The bill streamlines student aid programs into one grant program, one loan program, and one Work-Study program to ease confusion for students who are deciding the best options available to responsibly pay for their college education.   • Simplifies Repayment: The bill pares down the maze of loan repayment options to one standard 10-year repayment plan and one income-based repayment plan.   • Eliminates Burdensome Federal Regulations: The bill eliminates burdensome federal regulations that put Washington in the middle of issues that are the responsibility of institutions or states, limit student choice, and stifle innovation.   • Repeals Unfunded Programs: The bill repeals all unfunded programs ensuring congressional priorities are maintained in the future.","link","https://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=291","francisrooney.house.gov",56,34,8,5,0,0,0,4

Unfortunately, in a desperate quest to secure the failing Iran nuclear deal, the Obama Administration dropped an investigation, called Project Cassandra, into the Iranian-sponsored Islamic terrorist group Hezbollah and their global criminal network, including in Latin America. According to an Obama-era Treasury department official in testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the investigation was “tamped down for fear of rocking the boat with Iran and jeopardizing the nuclear deal.”   Iranian-sponsored Hezbollah mischief in the Western Hemisphere is nothing new, as shown through their links to the corrupt Maduro dictatorship in Venezuela and drug cartels across the region, and should not be taken lightly.","link","https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/obama-hezbollah-drug-trafficking-investigation/","politico.com",43,84,20,0,7,2,0,24

Since the Obama Administration labor board’s decision in 2011, ‘micro-unions’ had begun to form in retail stores and manufacturing sites across the country, making it nearly impossible for employers to manage such fragmentation of the workforce. In one case, the NLRB ruled that perfume and cosmetics salespeople at Macy’s, Inc. constituted their own ‘micro-union’ and could unionize alone. Imagine the confusion and cost as stockers, cashiers, shoe and clothing departments, etc., form their own unions at Macy’s.  By eliminating ‘micro-unions’ from the workplace, employees and managers will be better able to negotiate within their organization for their needs. This new ruling by the NLRB is a victory for the American worker.","link","https://francisrooney.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=293","francisrooney.house.gov",66,82,5,6,1,0,0,29

The facts are undeniable; every tax bracket will now be lower, the standard deduction will nearly double, the child tax credit doubles, and people will no longer be forced to pay a fine for not purchasing unaffordable Obamacare insurance. In addition, small businesses will see tax rates cut to a level that is competitive with the rest of the industrialized world. Combined with the unprecedented reduction in the regulatory state that has strangled our economy over the last eight years, America is now on track for a booming economy that works for everyone.”  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act facts:  A family of 4 earning a median income of $73,000 a year gets $2,059 more back in their pocket each year.  Repeals Obamacare individual mandate.  Nearly doubles the standard exemption – the first $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for couples is now tax-free.  Doubles the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child.   There are 43,634 taxpayers in FL-19 that claim the child tax credit.  Significantly reduces taxes for small business owners, impacting 62,041 taxpayers in FL-19 that have small business income.  Requires that you must have a Social Security number to receive a tax refund.  Maintains current deductions for medical expenses.  Maintains current deductions for out-of-pocket teacher expenses.  Maintains current deductions for charitable donations.  Maintains property tax deductions up to $10,000 a year (For example, a home valued at $620,000 in unincorporated Lee County or $527,000 in Cape Coral, our district’s largest city, would be below the cap).  The mortgage interest deduction would be capped at $750,000 for mortgages (down from $1 million now).

Congressman Rooney stated, ""The recent news of protests against the Ayatollah's regime by the Iranian people comes as no surprise. There is a clear distinction between the ideals of the people and the support by the theocratic government for Shiite terrorist groups like Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, and rogue regimes like Syria.    ""Further, these protests highlight an underlying failure of Obama's Iran deal. The money generated from relaxed sanctions is going to the government's unpopular foreign policy objectives and not the wishes of the people.""   Congressman Rooney has written an op-ed, titled ""A long view on Iran,"" (http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/355740-a-long-view-on-iran) discussing the differences between the ideals of the Iranian people and the Khamenei regime. Highlighted were studies conducted by Zogby which showed the Iranian people's lack of support for the government's hegemonic ambitions. For example, in 2016 only 24 percent of Iranians supported the Ayatollah's assistance to the Assad regime in Syria.   ###","status",NA,NA,103,65,9,2,5,0,1,10
