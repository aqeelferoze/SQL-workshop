With only 5 of the 23 Obamacare co-ops remaining, many Americans – particularly in rural areas like Northern Nevada – have been left with fewer choices. In fact, residents in 7 counties throughout CD-2 have only one insurance provider to choose from this year. Not only has the President’s failed healthcare law left these residents with no alternative, but it inflicts a penalty tax if they do not choose the coverage that Washington says is right for them.   I plan to offer much-needed relief to these Nevadans by reintroducing a bill that will exempt residents in counties with less than two provider options from this unfair tax. I also look forward to joining my colleagues this week as we pave the way for a stable transition to patient-centered solutions that will expand access to quality and affordable care.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/MarkAmodeiNV2/photos/a.373700335990031.109128.307227745970624/1612541078772611/?type=3",NA,46,37,23,0,0,1,2,8

In 1859, Charles W. Fuller built a log toll bridge across the Truckee River to provide the necessary connection between Virginia City and the California Trail. A few years later, Fuller sold the bridge to Myron C. Lake, who continued to  operate the bridge and lodging accommodations, renaming the developing community ""Lake's Crossing"".   After the arrival of the Central Pacific Railroad in 1868, Lake sold most of the land to the Railroad in exchange for a depot. Once the railroad station was built, a town site was laid out, and the town of Reno officially came into being 149 years ago today. Charles Crocker, the Railroad’s construction superintendent, named the community after Major General Jesse Lee Reno, a Union officer killed in the American Civil War at the Battle of South Mountain.  #HomeMeansNevada #BattleBorn   Photo source: University Libraries, UNR","photo","https://www.facebook.com/MarkAmodeiNV2/photos/a.373700335990031.109128.307227745970624/1758489297511121/?type=3",NA,109,40,34,4,0,1,0,0
