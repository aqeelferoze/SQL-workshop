However, this further underscores, Congress's blatant abdication of its responsibilities. Even if it means coming back from Easter recess, Congress should take up an authorization of use of military force and debate on a long term plan and a scope of authorities it would take to stop further atrocities, instead of simply yielding this congressional duty to the Executive Branch.  Congress is being negligent in its constitutional obligation,"" said Larson.

Consider the fact that the 400 wealthiest Americans will receive, on average, a $7 million tax cut, while 24 million people will lose their health insurance.   For the Republicans, repealing the Affordable Care Act has been likened to the passing of gallstones. In the face of town halls, where the American people soundly rejected their proposals, they chose to pass the bill rather than to continue to face the pain of the American people. Considering they did so without any Congressional Budget Office review of their bill’s cost nor with thorough debate, it was completed in haste and sharp contrast to everything they said they would do.   The most galling aspect, however, as FDR once stated, they are ‘frozen in the ice of their own indifference’  as they are willing to watch 24 million Americans lose their coverage and the millions who will lose their insurance due to pre-existing conditions and subsequently put into high-risk pools. Dorothy Thompson from Manchester, CT said it best at one of my recent town hall meetings, ‘these high risk pools sound like a death panel to me.’   Again, this bill was about tax cuts and not about the health care of the American people.","link","https://larson.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/larson-wasnt-about-health-care-it-was-about-politics","larson.house.gov",128,35,87,6,0,4,10,63

My thoughts are with the victims, their families, and their friends today.    The Orlando shooting was not the first nor the last tragedy where innocent lives are cut short due to gun violence.  Congress continues to be complicit in these tragedies because of the majority’s refusal to bring common sense gun violence prevention bills for a vote.  How many more lives will it take to bring up a vote? Moments of silence aren't enough.  That is why I cosponsored House Resolution 370, which simply says that anytime the House holds a moment of silence for victims of gun violence, a committee hearing must be held within 10 legislative days on the subject of that tragedy and on how to prevent gun violence in the future.  In other words, it would require Congress to have the debate on gun violence it has so far refused to have.     The best way for Congress to honor the victims is to come together and take meaningful action that will save lives and stop the violence.  We need action now.","status",NA,NA,26,5,1,0,0,0,2,0

First District businesses up and down the supply chain for vital programs like the F-35, Virginia class submarines, and military helicopter programs that help keep our military the best in the world, will benefit tremendously from this legislation.  This legislation not only supports the extraordinary work done by the workers at our large companies like Pratt and Whitney, but hundreds of suppliers across the district including small businesses like Horst Engineering, in East Hartford, Flanagan Industries in Glastonbury, ACMT in Manchester, and MB Aerospace in East Granby.  These are just four examples of the nearly 160 companies in the First District that benefit from the passing of the NDAA, which will enhance funding for the Connecticut-made aircraft engines, submarines, and helicopters ensuring that our military maintains an unmatched supremacy in the air and in the sea.   In the First Congressional District alone, work on the F-35 is supporting nearly 4,000 jobs and is resulting in $338 million in economic activity this year.  The First District is also a supplier of the Navy’s submarine programs representing $209 million in purchase orders this year and 32 suppliers of our military’s helicopter programs representing $95 million.  The NDAA passed by the House today builds on this activity and it continues the momentum for Connecticut’s manufacturing ecosystem. I commend the bipartisan process to create this defense package that will strengthen our nation’s armed forces, provide a pay increase for our troops, and equip them with the right tools to carry out their mission.","link","https://larson.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/house-passage-ndaa-win-cts-defense-manufacturing","larson.house.gov",20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The failure of the Senate GOP to pass their repeal will allow millions to retain their health care. The ACA is far from perfect, but as it has been proven in the last months and past few days, that the only way to move forward is to build upon the successes of the ACA and to work in a bi-partisan fashion through committee hearings, public testimony, and open debate.   Yesterday, I along with, Brian Higgins and Joe Courtney, announced we will be introducing the Medicare Buy-In and Healthcare Stabilization Act to begin that discussion and propose ways to make the system work better. This bill will establish a new option for Americans between the ages of 50-64 to buy into the Medicare network and benefits, thus avoiding the increase in premiums that older Americans in this age group often face in the private market. Additionally, Americans (ages 50-64) who receive coverage from their employer and wish to buy into the program would have the option to do so, and their employers could continue to contribute to their premiums pre-tax; a win-win for those employers and employees.    We need to put our partisan squabbles aside, and work for the American people.

It is Congress' responsibility to debate and authorize of use of military force. As I have called for before, it is time for Congress to have this debate again. It appears the President and his advisors have given a lot of thought to his plan, but that thought should also be debated and shared in Congress. When it comes to putting our troops in harms way and all the ramifications of that entails, it is Congress who must authorize the power. This debate must include both the extent of the use of force and what the exit strategy is.  I would like to commend President Trump on his recognition of the sacrifices our brave men and women have made, but that is precisely why we need to make sure that we have a clear strategy. The President has laid out a plan, but did not mention an exit strategy and that needs to be debated. President Trump also pointed out that we need to address Pakistan, their involvement and our response in this conflict. I agree, but believe this needs to be a part of the congressional debate.

Millions of Americans rely on Social Security for basic income when they are retired, or if they become severely disabled and can no longer work. There is no other private plan on the market that can compare. At the moment, the average wait-time for someone to get an appeal hearing on their disability benefits is 600 days. That is unacceptable. Some applicants lose their homes, their families, or even their lives while waiting for assistance. The current challenge of this process is the lack of adequate resources to help the more than 1 million people who are still waiting to get their cases heard. Since 2010, the number of Social Security beneficiaries has risen by 13 percent, while its operating budget has effectively been cut by 10 percent. Social Security beneficiaries and applicants deserve better. In addition, it is time that we take common sense steps to expand Social Security’s modest benefits to keep up with the needs to today and to strengthen the program for future generations.

We made clear our goals remain revenue and distributional neutrality. The President assured us that tax reform would benefit lower and middle income Americans and also make U.S. companies more competitive and fuel economic growth. If we are to generate real growth for our economy, we must implement tax reform that comes from the middle out and not from the top down. It was encouraging to hear the President express his willingness to work in a bipartisan manner on tax reform.   I also spoke with the President about a robust infrastructure package citing the conditions of the Hartford and East Hartford levees and the need to replace the I-84/I-91 interchange in Hartford with a tunnel system, which would ease congestion and be a boon for commerce along the Hartford riverfront. The President agreed as he has long said that the nation’s infrastructure is a priority for his office. It is my belief that tax reform is an opportunity to both raise the revenue for an infrastructure plan and build up the middle-class.","link","https://larson.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/larson-among-bipartisan-ways-and-means-members-who-met-trump","larson.house.gov",48,23,9,0,3,2,0,0

Those impacted by this decision are not statistics or a part of a political play; they are human beings, our fellow American citizens, who are being treated unfairly by this administration.  Between cutting funding for Affordable Care Act enrollment outreach, to pursuing new regulations to blow holes in the law that allow the sale of junk insurance, they are out to sabotage our health care system. On average, insurers across the nation have already raised their premiums by 20 percent because of threats from the President to end CSR payments. In Connecticut, nearly 46,000 residents benefit from the cost-sharing reduction program. Now more than ever, it is time for bipartisan action on commonsense solutions to improve our health care system, since the Trump Administration is determined to sabotage, and not help.

As a nation, we are woefully underinvesting in our infrastructure.  The American Society of Civil Engineers recently gave our infrastructure a grade of “D+”.  They have also found that if we keep investing at current rates, our deteriorating infrastructure will result in 2.5 million less jobs and will cost the typical American family $3,400.  This is simply unacceptable. We have to invest in our infrastructure and we have to have the courage to pay for it, without adding to the national debt.  That is exactly what this bill does and it is why it has been endorsed by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

Connecticut residents already pay more in federal taxes, than the state receives back in federal funding.  With this proposal the Connecticut middle-class will be paying even more. A middle-class family in Connecticut that owns a home will see an average tax increase of $800 a year (http://news.americansagainstdoubletaxation.org/press-releases/new-data-brady-tax-plan-with-partial-salt-elimination-would-raise-taxes-on-middle-class-homeowners-by-as-much-as-26/).  Hard working, blue collar families will continue to bear the burden of high taxes while corporations and their executives will see immense benefits. This bill was constructed in back rooms with not only the Democrats kept in the dark, but the majority of the Republican party as well. They have neglected to conduct hearings and listen to testimony, a far cry from regular order, and the Republican leadership are trying to jam this through solely for a political win – at the expense of the middle class and the Northeast. We have to find solutions that work for everyone and in order to do that, all parties must be at the table.

Over the past year, we’ve held hearings on the Social Security representative payee program, and from these hearings, we developed this bipartisan bill to strengthen this program meant to protect our most vulnerable fellow citizens. The SSA’s representative payee program helps approximately 8 million Social Security beneficiaries manage their benefits, if they are unable to do so themselves because they are children or have a condition that prevents them from handling their own benefits, such as Alzheimer’s.   It was once said that the moral test of any government is how it treats its most vulnerable citizens – children, seniors, and those with severe disabilities. This bill is a statement that Congress is committed to protecting those beneficiaries, such as seniors, children, and disabled adults, who have representative payees. I am proud to introduce this bill that will better safeguard those most in need of protection, including nearly 4 million children, by strengthening the selection and monitoring of payees, while reducing administrative burdens on families caring for loved ones.

As we approach Christmas, this is the present the Republicans are giving to the wealthy and corporations, paid for on the backs of the middle class in Connecticut, our seniors, and our state’s more most vulnerable.  Beginning next year, corporations will still be able to deduct State and Local Taxes, while individuals and families are capped at $10,000. Considering that 41 percent of Connecticut residents itemize and take this deduction – our state will be unfairly penalized. Additionally, the massive corporate tax cuts are made permanent, while the modest provisions intended to help out individuals expire in 2025. As a result, more than half of America’s middle class will see a tax increase by 2026 while the very wealthy and large corporations will continue to reap the benefits of a lower tax rate. And it gets worse too, because this plan will add  $1.5 trillion to the deficit, which will trigger an automatic cut of $25 billion to Medicare next year.

The Public Forum will be held from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm.  The House Republican tax proposal would be disastrous for Connecticut’s middle-class. Connecticut residents already pay $8 billion more in federal taxes than the state receives in federal funding. With the Republicans eliminating deductions like the State and Local Tax Deduction and the Medical Expense Deduction, Connecticut residents will have to pay more to fund tax cuts for the 1 percent, corporations, and other parts of the nation.  Last week, I fought this bill in the Ways and Means Committee. This week, we fought it on the House floor. Join me on Monday to discuss this proposal.  If you have any questions, please call 860-278-8888.  WHO:  Rep.
