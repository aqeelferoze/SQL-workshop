It’s not my intent to protest the election results or to make a statement about policy. I will not be attending the inauguration because I believe the office of the President deserves our respect, and that respect must begin with the President-elect himself.   For the last ten weeks, President-elect Trump has continually denigrated the office of the President by using his bully pulpit for insult and ridicule. Since he made his ignorant comments about Congressman John Lewis this weekend, I have heard dismay from hundreds of constituents. Thousands more have contacted me over the past months regarding his shameful remarks about women, the disabled, immigrants, and countless others — as well as his continued praise of a hostile foreign leader.   This is not normal. It is an embarrassment to our country and to the office of the presidency, and we must send the message that this behavior is not acceptable from the leader of our nation. Not attending the Inauguration is one way for me to do that.","status",NA,NA,10389,3020,2173,2223,23,22,39,241

Last year, the world’s nations came together out of urgent necessity and agreed with near unanimity to work together in combating the most pressing crisis of our time. The President’s decision to now reverse course betrays our allies, undermines our credibility, and exacerbates a global catastrophe.  There are no winners in this decision. America’s influence will now dwindle, the climate will continue to wreak havoc, and — despite the myths perpetuated by the President and his anti-science allies — our economy will suffer tremendously. Doubling down on denial will not bring back coal jobs, and the bliss of this ignorant misstep will be short-lived once the dire consequences begin to take their toll.","link","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-to-announce-us-will-exit-paris-climate-deal/2017/06/01/fbcb0196-46da-11e7-bcde-624ad94170ab_story.html?utm_term=.0744a133cc4f","washingtonpost.com",631,188,376,9,5,8,258,403

Our Governor has put Kentucky in a dangerous no-win situation. 85,000 Kentuckians will lose coverage if his waiver is approved, far more if it is denied. Unless the Governor reverses course, Kentucky families covered by Medicaid expansion must prepare for their health coverage to be taken away. This isn't rhetoric, it's a serious warning for those covered by our Medicaid expansion, particularly for Kentuckians with serious or life-threatening medical conditions. I’ve called on Governor Bevin to withdraw his request. He hasn't. So families must be prepared. I'll share HHS’s response once received.

Every American deserves access to the health care they need.  As we move forward, it's time for Congressional Republicans to listen to the American people and work with Democrats to improve and strengthen the Affordable Care Act.  This doesn’t stop in Washington. Some states have successfully implemented the law, others have not.
