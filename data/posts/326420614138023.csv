While the Obama Administration prioritized the removal of violent criminals, the Trump Administration has deemed almost all undocumented immigrants – with the exception of some DACA recipients – priorities for deportation. The door is open for families to be ripped apart, separating hardworking parents from their children. Additionally, increasing the number of immigrant detention facilities, reinstating the controversial Secure Communities program, expanding the number of individuals subject to expedited removal, and referring parents who brought their children to the United States for criminal prosecution undermine our national security and our economic might. These costly measures and the administration’s insistence on building an ineffective, multi-billion dollar border wall are not efficient uses of our resources.    I agree that we must remove violent individuals who entered the United States illegally. But in targeting an exponentially larger segment of the immigrant population, the President’s extreme orders make our country less safe.

The bill aims to close a loophole that allows some child pornographers to escape prosecution by arguing over intent. OK, sounds like a good idea. But Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee points out a big loophole in the new bill that would allow for the prosecution of consenting teenagers who are sexting each other (i.e., they are in a relationship and only sharing the images with each other) to be charged for child pornography and prosecuted to serve a 15 year minimum sentence. Again, this includes a boyfriend/girlfriend sharing images only with each other. So I figured, OK, I'm sure the bill's author will accept Rep. Jackson Lee’s amendment, close the loophole and we can all support the bill. No. Instead he argues basically that no prosecutor would ever charge people in that situation. Yes, somebody will. Or they'll use the possibility of charging as heavy leverage to get something out of a defendant. So now we face a choice: Vote YES for what is now a bad piece of legislation that creates as many (if not more) problems than it solves or vote NO and be accused sometime next October of going easy on child pornographers. That's Congress, folks. I voted NO. I am in my eighth term in public service, all in the minority party.   So why didn't they just take Rep. Jackson Lee’s amendment? Maybe they see no problem sending a teenage couple to jail for fifteen years for sexting. Maybe because they know they already have the votes needed to pass the bill and can just do it their way. But more likely, it's because the majority party knows it can force people in the other party to either go along or take a ""bad"" vote. The quest to create wedges (by the majority) and the politics of self-preservation and ambition (by the minority) lead to bad public policy. All of us have fallen for it – both parties do it in legislatures across the country.   I love representing my hometown and always have. But there are times when people ask me, ""what's the worst part of the job?"" More than the hamster wheel of fundraising, ping-pong travel between D.C. and home or anything else it is this cycle of wedging and C-Y-A politics that corrodes the American Congress. The problem with Congress is not that there is too much legitimate policy disagreement, people are legitimately pro-life or pro-choice; pro vouchers or against them, etc. The more pernicious problem is that, as in the case of H.R. 1761, the Protecting Against Child Exploitation Act, disagreement is preserved, manufactured, or coerced for political purposes, even when agreement is well within reach. So next year, if they say the 51 of us who voted no are sympathetic to child pornographers, remember our conversation.","status",NA,NA,225,38,58,4,2,35,9,31

That this highly suspect behavior immediately preceded Mr. Comey’s firing raises very disturbing questions about the President’s motive in removing the Director.

My statement with Congressman Brendan Boyle, after meeting with U.S. diplomats and European officials in Berlin and Hamburg, Germany:  “As the United States strives to create a more peaceful, democratic world, our efforts benefit greatly from the strong transatlantic alliance. Cooperation on economic and security matters supports North American and European prosperity and addresses mutual security concerns. Working together, we are better equipped to respond to crises and confront evolving challenges like terrorism, climate change, and threats to the international order. Our continued partnership and close cooperation, built on our shared history and values, not only promotes democracy and liberty throughout the world, but also strengthens them within our own societies.    “At every opportunity, the United States must reiterate its unwavering commitment to our NATO allies and to the principle of collective defense. Forums like the G20 provide global platforms to voice those assurances and demonstrate collective leadership.

Another of my amendments would provide $10 million to supply Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents with body camera technology. Body-worn cameras are not a cure-all, but they improve officers’ public interactions, de-escalate conflicts, and increase trust in law enforcement. Local law enforcement agencies around the country are adopting body cameras – federal law enforcement agencies should do the same.   My third amendment would prevent the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from entering into contracts with privatized immigration detention facilities in FY 2018. A DHS study found that privatized facilities have staffing deficiencies, subpar medical care, and inefficient abuse reporting systems.

Failing to certify Iran’s compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) moves the United States closer to abrogating the agreement, which would dramatically increase the risk of Iran moving forward in developing nuclear weapons and lead to the further destabilization of the Middle East. There are many aspects of Iran’s behavior that the United States must confront, including its development of ballistic missiles and support for terrorist groups. The United States Congress has consistently addressed these challenges through legislation. Undermining the JCPOA, a successful effort to limit Iran’s nuclear weapons capability, makes it much harder for our allies around the world to trust us when we approach them to work on these other issues.  Today’s announcement is the latest of President Trump’s many missteps that have severely damaged the United States’ credibility around the world. After wavering on this landmark agreement, why would any country enter into a high-stakes deal with the United States in the future? How does the President expect to marshal support for plans to address North Korea, Syria, or any other crisis after demonstrating his willingness to withdraw from an agreement led and negotiated by the United States?      President Trump’s actions and comments repeatedly demonstrate a failure to grasp matters of critical importance to our national security. His announcement contradicts the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman’s assessment, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s assessment, and whatever assessment he made that prompted him to twice certify Iran’s compliance this year. Congress must not vote to reapply sanctions suspended under the JCPOA and risk compounding the damage done by this reckless decision.","status",NA,NA,301,91,60,0,3,10,95,133
