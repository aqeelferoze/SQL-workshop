Our current system was put in place when most Americans had never heard of the internet, the only phone they had was attached to the wall at home and Bill Curry and Pat Dye were coaching at Alabama and Auburn.    It’s time for a tax code that puts working Americans first.  More than 80% of the people in the 4th District will see their tax burden drop, and to me, that is a good thing.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RobertAderholt/photos/a.138401439402.110118.19787529402/10155253615399403/?type=3",NA,189,68,17,13,0,0,0,15

During my time in Congress I've received my fair shared of awards, but this one stands out.  To be honored by the men and women who put food on our tables everyday is a cut above the rest.  In many ways, Alabama's 4th Congressional District is Alabama's bread basket.  Whether it's cattle farms in DeKalb County, poultry farms in Cullman County or a dairy farm in Lamar County, the 4th Congressional District, along with the rest of the farmers in this state, are feeding Alabama and America.  It's an honor to serve you in Congress.  Thank you for this great honor.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RobertAderholt/videos/10155330484814403/",NA,101,18,8,2,0,0,0,1

Far too many of the people in Washington believe that everything you earn belongs, not to you, but to the government.  Those people are wrong.  It is your money and you should be able to keep more of it.  When I first posted about this bill last month, many of you expressed concern about medical deductions.  We listened to your concerns and those deductions were returned to the bill.  The child tax credit has also been expanded.  More than 80% of the people in the 4th District will receive a tax cut and that is a good thing. This bill also lowers the corporate tax rate, so companies are no longer penalized for keeping their businesses and jobs in the USA. Our 20th Century Tax Code desperately needed updating.  This bill achieves that goal.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RobertAderholt/videos/10155370324884403/",NA,329,141,41,31,0,0,3,32
