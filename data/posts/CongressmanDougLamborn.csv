First, I supported House Resolution 11 objecting to UN Security Council Resolution 2334 although I recognize that this measure did not go far enough. The Obama Administration’s refusal to veto this anti-Israel bill is an insult to our friend Israel, and we must do more to defend our greatest ally in the region.   For these reasons, I have gone a step further by introducing H.R. 263, a bill to render United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 null and void as a matter of United States law. This legislation would ensure that the United States is not bound by any provision of UNSCR 2334 and denies the UN Security Council Resolution from being used U.S. Courts.   Finally, I introduced H.R. 264, which would restrict all UN funding until we have more transparency on how much US taxpayer money is being contributed to the UN and how it is being used.  http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/House-passes-resolution-condemning-UN-for-Israel-action-477641","link","http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/House-passes-resolution-condemning-UN-for-Israel-action-477641","jpost.com",72,16,10,5,1,0,0,0

For years, I have heard and seen the damage caused by the onerous and partisan law. The time has arrived to work in a bipartisan manner with the Trump Administration to implement a plan that will keep premiums and deductibles affordable for American families and will encourage market competition so that citizens have more healthcare choices, not less.   Each and every day, Obamacare makes things worse. The costs of premiums and deductibles increase for too many job creators, individuals, and families. Americans are forced off of healthcare plans they prefer. This twisted web of mandates, taxes, and regulations cannot be fixed. We must fully repeal Obamacare so that we can start over with a new approach.    Replacing President Obama’s failed health care law will not happen overnight and people will not lose coverage overnight as a part of this transition. During this complex process, the unified Republican government will be focused on putting reforms in place ensuring that people across this country have access to a health care system that is truly affordable and centered on the needs of the patients it is supposed to serve.

Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced similar legislation in the Senate this week:  “Holding the VA accountable has been a top priority throughout my tenure in Congress, and it is past time to get these reform efforts across the finish line and passed into law. After three years of witnessing systemic abuse—including falsified waitlists, whistleblower retaliation, and abysmal patient care—this bill will provide real accountability and culture change at the VA.  Too often, misbehaving and even criminal employees have continued to receive a salary at taxpayers’ expense. This strong piece of legislation expedites the discipline process to make it easier to demote or fire employees for misconduct. Although I recognize that the vast majority of VA employees are good people trying to serve our veterans, we cannot ignore the serious problems that result from employee misconduct. Eliminating the worst of the worst will send a clear message to all agency employees and will begin to change the culture of corruption that has become too prevalent at the VA. We owe it to honest VA employees, American taxpayers, and especially our veterans to hold the VA accountable for misdeeds.   I urge my colleagues in the House and the Senate to support my legislation, and  I encourage President-elect Trump to sign these reform efforts into law during his first 100 days.”   http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/rubio-renews-push-to-speed-up-va-firings/article/2612229","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanDougLamborn/photos/a.379699372286.156401.45059452286/10155043480967287/?type=3",NA,33,10,2,3,0,0,1,0

President Trump's recent Executive Order is consistent with H.R 4038, a bipartisan bill that passed the House in the last Congress and called for a temporary halt of refugees from nations torn apart by terrorism until the implementation of increased security and screening measures. By taking steps to temporarily stop refugee admittance from nations that are hotbeds of terrorist activity, the President is taking prudent action to ensure that his national security and law enforcement teams have the strategies and systems in place that they will need to protect and defend America.   While I do not support the broad, misinformed, and inflammatory criticisms of the Executive Order, it is important that the privileges of law-abiding Green Card holders are not abridged. I appreciate the White House Chief of Staff clarifying this point over the weekend.   Rather than being influenced by one-sided media narratives, it is important to remember that President Obama also implemented temporary refugee and visa restrictions for national security purposes.

It also conveys a perpetual public access easement for the lower portion of the popular Barr Trail. In exchange, the federal government transfers 83 acres located at Emerald Valley Ranch on the southeast side of Pikes Peak and a perpetual access easement along two Forest Service roads to the Broadmoor.   This land exchange provides increased outdoor recreational opportunities for the Pikes Peak region. The 320-acre Crags property is completely surrounded by the Pike National Forest and has been the top acquisition priority for the Pikes Peak Ranger District for several years. The property provides several opportunities to connect forest system trails emanating from The Crags Campground with trails in the Putney Gulch area. In addition, existing trails within the property could become key links in the proposed Ring-the-Peak Trail.

The steps President Trump is taking in his Executive Order are consistent with this approach.  Today’s Executive Order places six nations beset by terrorism, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, under a 90 day travel ban. This temporary suspension will allow the government time to implement more stringent vetting and screening procedures. It is important to note that this temporary suspension DOES NOT apply to Green Card holders, aliens currently in the United States, aliens currently possessing valid visas, dual national aliens, or aliens already granted asylum or refugee status in the United States. Protecting the safety and security of the American people is the primary responsibility of the federal government. I appreciate President Trump and his team revisiting this vitally important issue of foreign terrorist entry into the United States.  Additional Information (Courtesy of the White House):  Differences from Previous EO • Iraq is Not Covered by the Suspension o Iraq has taken a number of steps that will help improve the security of U.S. borders and further deepen the vital U.S.-Iraq counterterrorism partnership. o In particular, we will work jointly with our Iraqi partners to enhance information-sharing on terror suspects, consistent with the comprehensive partnership between the United States and Iraq rooted in the Strategic Framework Agreement. o This progress further underscores why the Government of Iraq remains such a vital partner in our shared fight against ISIS. We continue to strongly support Iraq and the Iraqi people as we work together to defeat terrorism.  • Precise Scope and Language o This EO applies only to nationals of those six countries who are outside of the United States, who lack a valid visa on the effective date of this EO, and who lacked a valid visa when the original EO was issued. o Some courts mistakenly concluded that green-card holders were subject to the original EO. This new order makes it very clear that green-card holders are not covered. o Although the original EO was entirely lawful, the courts misinterpreted its language. The President made sure this new order gives fair notice to all.  • Deferred Effective Date o By deferring the effective date of the order until March 16, all affected agencies and personnel will have ample time to ensure an orderly implementation process.  • Refugees Scheduled for Transit o The new EO does not apply to refugees scheduled for transit.  • Syrian Treated Same as All Other Refugees  • Broader Waiver Authority o The President trusts in the experience and knowledge of his Secretary of State and Secretary of Homeland Security. This order makes it clear that they have broad authority to grant waivers based on their expert judgments.  • No References to Persecuted Religious Minorities o The new order provides more generally for waivers in cases of undue hardship, but does not separately reference persecuted religious minorities. http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/322475-trump-issues-new-immigration-order-meant-to-overcome-court","link","http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/322475-trump-issues-new-immigration-order-meant-to-overcome-court","thehill.com",19,13,2,0,0,0,1,10

The bills I supported this week ensure that the EPA will be open with the public regarding the scientific data, studies, and information they use during their rulemaking and regulatory process. By having the public more involved every step of the way; the EPA will be more accountable to the American people.""  More Information (Courtesy of the House Majority Whip) H.R. 1430 - Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment (HONEST) Act H.R. 1430 (Chairman Lamar Smith) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be transparent with the scientific data and information used to issue new regulations. • The EPA did not release data or other technical information required to replicate analyses that were the basis for costly regulations. • H.R. 1430 requires the EPA to base its regulations on the best available science that is publicly available. • This allows outside researchers to independently reproduce and validate EPA decisions. • The bill also protects confidential and personal identifiable information from disclosure. • 114th Congress: Similar legislation passed by a vote of 241-175 on March 18, 2015. • Committee Action: H.R. 1430 passed the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology by a vote of 17-2.  H.R. 1431 - EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act H.R. 1431 (Rep. Lucas) reforms the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Science Advisory Board (SAB) to increase public participation, transparency, and independence of the Board.  • The SAB reviews the science the EPA uses to propose new regulations and advises the agency on broad scientific matters.  • H.R. 1431 reforms the SAB by increasing transparency and public participation by making public all reports and scientific advice of the Board, as well as requiring public information-gathering sessions.  • Changes the selection process for the SAB to ensure individuals with substantial and relevant experience serve as advisors on the board and disclose conflicts of interest.  • Requires the Board to include state, local, and tribal experts. • The legislation ensures the SAB provides independent advice, publishes dissenting views, and reinforces the peer review process. • 114th Congress: Similar legislation, H.R. 1029, passed by a vote of 236-181 on March 17, 2015. • Committee Action: H.R. 1431 passed the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology by a vote of 19-14.  http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/29/restoring-the-epas-credibility/","link","http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/29/restoring-the-epas-credibility/","dailycaller.com",12,25,2,0,0,2,0,8

Along with other Members of Congress, I urged the President to act quickly on this order, to restore to people of faith the freedoms that have been being encroached upon in recent years. Under the Obama Administration, men and women faced crippling penalties for simply living out their faith in their everyday lives.  The United States of America has a long and rich history of being a bastion of freedom for those persecuted for living out their religious beliefs. I am grateful for the efforts of this administration to return to those values by reining in the culture of government intimidation and unfair punishments of those seeking to faithfully live out their deeply held convictions. No one should ever be forced to decide between giving up their deeply held convictions or facing the threat of unfair government punishment through crippling fines. Religious liberty takes nothing away from American citizens, but merely underscores the value and right of religious expression for the many millions of Americans who hold to a particular faith.  http://lamborn.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1998","link","http://lamborn.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1998","lamborn.house.gov",120,182,21,14,1,2,6,129

The AHCA has improved over the last month. The Freedom Caucus has worked with the moderate Tuesday Group to forge a compromise that will lower premiums and increase the flexibility of individual states to manage their health care decisions. Additionally, I personally negotiated with House Leadership to fix an error that locked veterans into the VA health system and prevented them from accessing the benefits of the AHCA. Securing this important victory for our veterans allowed me to support the bill.  With this vote, we have ended the individual mandate, blocked federal funding from going to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, phased out Medicaid expansion, reduced regulations and taxes, and gutted Obamacare. I hope that the Senate is able to build upon the good work done by the House and deliver a strong bill to the President. By standing with President Trump, Vice President Pence, and Health and Human Services Secretary Price, I have voted to move us forward to a future of improved health care access and affordability for all Americans.  http://lamborn.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1999","link","http://lamborn.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1999","lamborn.house.gov",173,573,54,17,5,3,34,400

Our plan allows states to serve and provide financial support directly to vulnerable populations, including people with preexisting conditions. We’ve seen this system work before—just look at Maine. After the state created an “invisible” high-risk pool (“invisible” because it did not cordon off people with preexisting conditions from the traditional market) and relaxed its premium rating rules in 2011, people with preexisting conditions continued to have access to health care and their premiums were cut in half. Young and healthy people could finally afford to enter the market, and prices stabilized even further. This approach was more personal, reasonable and innovative than anything a bureaucrat in D.C. could have imagined.

This policy precludes international non-governmental organizations from receiving funding from the United States if that NGO performs abortion as a method of family planning, or promotes abortion as such. Historically, this policy had applied to funds under international family planning streams.   However, when President Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy in January, he further directed Secretary Tillerson to expand the policy to include all global health assistance under the Department of State, Department of Defense, and USAID. This is a critical step in protecting American taxpayers from unwittingly funding abortion overseas, while also freeing up funds to support other NGOs that are not enmeshed in the tragic business of abortion.  https://lamborn.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2001","link","https://lamborn.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2001","lamborn.house.gov",47,40,9,10,0,0,0,55

Most importantly, the proposal makes a significant down payment on rebuilding America’s military strength. While this proposal only gets us halfway to where we need to be, it is a step in the right direction. I am also pleased to see $2.6 billion allocated for border security construction, improvements, technology, and manpower. Also, this budget proposal balances in 10 years and protects Social Security and Medicare. While it is true that there will be spending reductions tied to significant welfare reform, these changes will come with economic growth that will replace dependence on government assistance with the dignity that comes from work. By making these reforms, welfare benefits will be more effectively targeted toward those Americans the programs are intended to serve.    It’s important to note that this is the beginning of a process. The President proposes spending levels, but the Congress uses its power of the purse to weigh-in with its priorities as well. I would anticipate many changes to come. However, I appreciate the President setting a fiscally responsible benchmark.

By successfully shooting down an ICBM-class target, America demonstrated that we can defend ourselves from nuclear attack. And the world should know that America will defend itself from nuclear attack. I hope that our enemies were all watching closely and took note of what we are capable of achieving.    We must recognize the truly remarkable science and engineering that goes into a test of this nature. America’s technological innovations and advantages were showcased to the whole world today. The entire team that designed and built the system, and the warfighters who operate it, deserve our highest praise. Colorado Springs plays a central role in our missile defense efforts including: NORTHCOM at Peterson AFB and the Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center and the Colorado National Guard's 100th Missile Defense at Schriever AFB.    As the Co-Chair of the Missile Defense Caucus and a strong advocate for missile defense in Congress, I believe that today’s successful test will remind my colleagues in Washington that this capability is worth investing in, especially if we are to truly build the state of the art system President Trump has promised to build. Simply put, we are spending less than we should be on missile defense. We must increase our investment in missile defense to provide our nation with the cutting-edge safety and security necessary in a dangerous world filled with enemies who wish to harm our homeland.  http://abcnews.go.com/US/pentagon-conduct-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-intercept-test-heels/story?id=47724129","link","http://abcnews.go.com/US/pentagon-conduct-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-intercept-test-heels/story?id=47724129","abcnews.go.com",70,18,12,6,2,0,2,1

It isn't even part of the Affordable Care Act passed by Congress.  Rather, more than a year after Obamacare became law, the 44th president's Department of Health and Human Services issued this requirement as a regulation. The mandate bans employers from providing health care coverage to employees unless they also provide free contraception. Penalties for transgressors are enormous and punitive, up to $100 a day per employee, and can run into millions of dollars a year for any medium-sized business.  This rule, unnecessary to achieve coverage goals, has been challenged in court because it rides roughshod over the freedom of Christians and others to practice their religion and act according to its teachings.  http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trumps-rule-gets-government-back-out-of-religion/article/2624780","link","http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trumps-rule-gets-government-back-out-of-religion/article/2624780","washingtonexaminer.com",70,87,12,11,0,3,1,67

The VA's shoddy treatment of some veterans is a shameful stain on America. It's time to clean house in the VA and remove the negligent employees that are harming our heroes. That's why one of the first actions I took this year was to introduce VA accountability legislation. I have called on my colleagues in the House and Senate to enact stricter measures to control the hiring and firing of misbehaving employees and improve veterans' care.  I am encouraged by the passage of this bill, and I urge Congress to pass additional reform legislation to improve the situation at the VA. Fortunately, we now have a President and a VA Secretary who are dedicated to fixing the problems. When we make accountability a reality, we will restore honor, integrity, and trust to the relationship between the VA and our nation's brave veterans.  The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 would:   • Create a new streamlined and efficient process to remove, demote or suspend (for longer than 14 days) any VA employee for poor performance or misconduct with a concrete shortened timeline, while still protecting employees' due process rights, and would provide them with the right to appeal the action.   • Provide expanded protections for whistleblowers and would specifically bar VA from using this removal authority if the employee has an open whistleblower complaint/case with the Office of Special Counsel.   • Provide the Secretary with the authority to reduce an employee's federal pension if they are convicted of a felony that influenced their job at VA; recoup a bonus provided to an employee who engaged in misconduct or poor performance prior to receiving the bonus; and allow the Secretary to recoup any relocation expenses that were authorized for a VA employee only through the employee's ill-gotten means, such as fraud waste or malfeasance.   • Authorize the Secretary to directly appoint individuals to the positions of Medical Center Director and Director of Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) if they have a demonstrated ability in the medical profession, health care administration or health care fiscal management. This will make it easier to fill these critical positions quickly.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanDougLamborn/photos/a.379699372286.156401.45059452286/10155527227937287/?type=3",NA,27,14,3,7,0,0,0,1

It is my hope that his words will comfort any who are affected by this attack or any other acts of violence:   ""Almighty God, on a day when violence has come to this Assembly, we ask Your blessing on our brother Representative Steve Scalise, the two Officers and the staffer who have been shot. Bless the hands of those who tend to their injuries.  ""We as Americans are blessed by a free and open society, with rights secured by law and the Constitution.  But once again we are reminded that there is a vulnerability that comes with that openness. May we all be vigilant in being good citizens, neighbors and defenders of our way of life, at a time when so many challenges to our way of life and government seem under siege.  ""We thank You for the men and women who respond to the crises that befall us, especially the Capitol Police, and all first responders.  May their heroism and generosity of Spirit be an inspiration to us all, and may they be assured of our appreciation of their service. And, in this great silence, as we are gathered, most dramatically, as this Assembly, the People’s House, may Republicans and Democrats be mindful of the rare companionship they share, men and women, who have taken very public responsibility for our country, that carries so many burdens and, today, the reminder, shared danger. May this day be characterized by kindness, good will and compassion, one to another.  ""God, Bless America, and may all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.

Under the Affordable Care Act as well as the American Health Care Act, those who are eligible for VA healthcare benefits were not eligible for tax credits to purchase private insurance. These provisions would limit healthcare choices for up to seven million veterans nationwide—including many individuals in Colorado’s fifth district.  After I voiced my concerns to House Leadership, the VETERANS Act was introduced to create a permanent exception that will allow veterans to receive tax credits for health insurance.   We must not waiver in providing the quality coverage and care our veterans deserve. They have bravely served our country, and now it’s our turn to serve them.

This week, our subcommittee has produced two bills that will cut red tape and streamline the permitting process for electric companies and water storage infrastructure.  In Colorado, we know the devastating impact that wildfires can have on our communities and the natural beauty of our state. H.R. 1873 will strengthen the electric grid, which will improve overall safety and reduce the chances of electric-caused wildfires.  H.R. 1654 also simplifies the process for water storage permits.

Hydropower can and should be part of an ""all of the above"" energy strategy now and well into our future. It is a reliable and emissions-free source of electricity that accounts for a majority of the nation's total renewable electricity generation. In my Colorado, we have over sixty operating hydropower facilities that generate more than 1,100 mega-watts, including new projects such as Carter Lake, South Canal, and Ridgeway Reservoir. However, as is the case nation-wide, there is potential for new hydropower generation in Colorado.        My bill, the Bureau of Reclamation Pumped Storage Hydropower Development Act, looks to pave the way for additional clean hydropower generation by clearing up regulatory permitting confusion at existing Bureau of Reclamation facilities. This legislation makes it clear that the Bureau of Reclamation is the lead agency that will oversee pumped storage development for projects exclusively utilizing the agency's facilities.    The regulatory clarification in H.R. 1967, will help pave the way for more pumped storage by incentivizing developers, who will in turn pay the American taxpayers for the use of federal facilities. In a Water, Power and Oceans Subcommittee hearing earlier this spring, even our friends on the other side of the aisle agreed that we should be doing all we can to incentivize clean, renewable hydropower generation at existing federal facilities. That is why this bill was passed by the House Natural Resources Committee by unanimous consent in April, and passed the House unanimously today.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanDougLamborn/photos/a.379699372286.156401.45059452286/10155573693092287/?type=3",NA,33,11,3,1,0,0,0,0

During the Committee hearing process, I authored and supported amendments and provisions that will add 17,000 soldiers to the Army, increase funding for missile defense by $2 billion, triple the budget for the National Space Defense Center at Schriever AFB, elevate the importance of Space Command and other space efforts, such as the creation of a Space Corps, prioritize cyber, and allocate $90 million to military construction projects in the Colorado Springs area—including projects at Peterson AFB and the Air Force Academy. I was also able to help fend off amendments that tried to tie military spending to environmental and social engineering agendas at the expense of our most urgent national security needs.   It is my honor and my solemn duty to participate in this important bipartisan process. For over five decades, the House Armed Services Committee has been able to set aside our partisan differences and come together to craft legislation that allows our military to be the best fighting force that the world has ever known.  NDAA Summary (Courtesy of the House Armed Services Committee)   READINESS -- After a half-decade of cuts, we're rebuilding  • The NDAA authorizes increasing the size of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Army Guard and Reserve, Naval and Air Reserve, and Air Guard. • It increases funding for maintenance for all Services, for increased training opportunities, and for sustaining, restoring, and modernizing facilities. • The NDAA provides for U.S. involvement and support for efforts in strategic regions around the world. • It enhances our defense by modernizing our nuclear weapons stockpile, missile defense, and military vehicles; and supporting defensive and offensive cyberspace strategy. • It prohibits transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United States, and from transferring the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay back to Cuba. RESOURCES -- Providing our troops and their families what they need  • This bill fully funds the 2.4 percent pay raise our troops are entitled to under law. It also extends special pay and bonuses for service members. • It blocks the misguided attempt to close military medical facilities upon which our deployed troops and their families rely. • Provides commonsense resources to help families manage challenges like relocations, including reimbursements for spouse's obtaining licensing/certification in another state.    REFORM -- We're reforming the way the Pentagon does business.  • Building on the reforms we enacted over the past two years with strong bipartisan support: Updated retirement system, improved military health care system, made commissary benefits more efficient and sustainable, overhauled bureaucracy, and made changes to the way the Pentagon buys goods and services. • The FY18 NDAA further streamlines bureaucracy, drives efficiency through competition, and gives the Pentagon the tools it needs to make better business decisions. o Adding oversight to service contracts. Any funding for services that need to be contracted out will now be submitted through the DOD budget process, forcing the Pentagon to analyze actual needs and spending patterns. Congress will have a better idea of what kinds of services are being contracted and their cost. o Improve the way the Pentagon buys commercial off-the-shelf goods, by allowing the DOD to use online commercial sites like Amazon or Grainger, to get goods at a lower price, quicker, and in a more transparent process. o Reforms contract auditing by using more efficient, cost-effective private sector companies to audit incurred costs to reap real benefits for the taxpayers. • The NDAA also updates Uniform Code of Military Justice to prohibit crimes of non-consensual sharing of intimate images.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanDougLamborn/photos/a.379699372286.156401.45059452286/10155638543257287/?type=3",NA,14,10,0,2,0,0,0,1

These Airmen faced overwhelming danger and demonstrated service before self. Capt. Dustin Smail, of Colorado Springs, CO, put himself at risk of surface to air fire, allowing friendly forces to escape without suffering any losses.    Before dawn on July 3, 2016, Capt. Dustin Smail led a team of two F-16s into northern Syria near the city of Manbij to provide close air support for ground forces combating ISIS.   He was asked to monitor a suspicious, armed individual that a pair of A-10 pilots had been tracking near friendly forces. After the A-10s departed, Smail saw rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire flashing in the night.  He found a large group of ISIS fighters converging on a friendly location attacking with machine guns, RPGs and grenades. The ground forces were outnumbered and overwhelmed by enemy fire, and unable to maneuver away from the threat.  A joint terminal attack controller requested immediate support and approved a danger close attack. Realizing the enemy was much too close to friendly forces to strike the target with bombs, Smail planned night strafe attacks to force the ISIS fighters to retreat. With dawn approaching and the barrage of gunfire and explosions impairing his night vision goggles and heads up display, Smail was unable to visually see the ground or the target during the attack and had to trust his wingman’s mark as his only reference.  Smail took off his goggles and prepared to undertake an extremely complex attack with poor visual cues that would put him into the heart of enemy surface-to-air fire. He directed his wingman to call in corrections to his strafe passes while coordinating for a nearby Predator to strike the same position with a Hellfire missile.  During his first pass, Smail’s attack suppressed enemy fire. The second strafe factored in his wingman’s corrections and hit the ISIS position. The combined effects of his attack and the Hellfire strike from the Predator forced the enemy to retreat. Friendly forces were able to fall back to a safer position.  While tracking the retreating enemy, Captain Smail found 15 additional ISIS fighters who met up with retreating forces and maneuvered to flank the new friendly position. Realizing friendly forces would be overrun if attacked by so many fighters, Smail’s formation quickly performed two airstrikes that killed several ISIS ground troops and forced their retreat to a nearby village. Because of the timely actions of Smail and his wingman, friendly forces were able to escape without suffering any losses.  Captain Smail conducted a total of 68 missions during this six-month deployment and received three Air Medals for his actions.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongressmanDougLamborn/photos/a.379699372286.156401.45059452286/10155707163412287/?type=3",NA,11,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

At Masterpiece Cakeshop, Jack served everyone with his cookies and brownies, but made special cakes for certain events. If his conscience could not support an order, he would refer the order to another baker with whom he has a good working relationship. When he declined an order for a cake for a same sex wedding and referred the order to this same baker, however, Jack was immediately targeted by the ACLU and the Colorado Civil Rights Commission.

It was simply the right thing to do. Today, however, I could not support the Pelosi-Schumer Senate amendment to that bill because it increased our statutory debt limit and funded the government only through December. Moreover, this spending package hurts our military, forcing it to continue operating on stop-gap spending with a continuing resolution for the next three months. While our national debt is almost at $20 trillion dollars, Washington’s addiction to overspending persists. If debt ceilings must be raised and the government continued to be funded, I want to see conservative fiscal measures included to restrain out of control spending so we don’t get into the same predicament again.

First, graduate students should NOT be punished with higher taxes when many are already operating on a tight budget. I support the repeal of the tax on graduate tuition waivers. Second, Congress should repeal the Death Tax for a sounder fiscal policy and better reform to our outdated tax code. That's why I sent letters to Chairman Brady and Speaker Ryan in order to see change in the current tax proposal.","status",NA,NA,47,75,2,4,2,1,0,25
