But they are bypassing important steps to make sure that these billionaire nominees are free of dangerous conflicts of interest – and Senate tradition. Hearings are historically not conducted until the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics has certified that each nominee has no unresolved conflicts.  Confirmation hearings for Trump’s nominees start on Tuesday – so Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and I wrote to the OGE two days ago to ask how the ethics reviews were coming along. OGE director Walter Shaub wrote back that “OGE has not received even initial draft financial disclosure reports for some of the nominees scheduled for hearings” – and it would be “be cause for alarm if the Senate were to go forward with hearings on nominees whose reports OGE has not certified.”  This is ridiculous. Donald Trump’s nominees can’t drag their feet on their required ethics paperwork while their friends in the Senate try to run out the clock. Cabinet officials must put the interests of our country before their own bank accounts – and NO Senate confirmation hearings should be held until we are 100% certain that is the case.

She has repeatedly demonstrated her contempt for public education, she plans to maintain financial ties that could create conflicts of interest, and she is unwilling to commit to be a cop on the beat with for-profit colleges that break the law and cheat students.  Mrs. DeVos has no record in higher education, but I gave her the opportunity to prove to the American people that she is serious about standing up for students. During her confirmation hearing, I asked Mrs. DeVos basic, straightforward questions about her commitment to protecting students and taxpayers from fraud committed by shady for-profit colleges. But she was unwilling to commit to using the Department's many tools and resources to keep students from getting cheated.  Mrs. DeVos's record on K-12 education has been focused on using her vast fortune to push her own ideology on hardworking families that are just trying to get their kids a decent education in public schools. Not only are her ideas completely uninformed by experience with public schools, but the evidence is clear that her privatization theories are bad for students.  I've heard from thousands of teachers, parents, and education leaders in Massachusetts raising deep concerns about Mrs. DeVos. I hear their concerns, and I share their concerns. This includes a letter sent to me from the Massachusetts Charter Public School Association about Mrs. DeVos's devastating record of promoting for-profit and online charter schools with virtually no accountability or oversight for how well these schools actually serve students and families. Unlike the successful, thoughtful, and innovative education policies we have implemented in Massachusetts with regard to public charter schools, the policies Mrs. DeVos has bankrolled have drained valuable taxpayer dollars out of the public education system in Michigan and left kids worse off.  It is hard to imagine a less qualified or more dangerous person to be entrusted both with our country's education policy and with a trillion-dollar student loan program.

I saw the shoddy, paper-thin rubber rafts that people cram onto with nothing more than a hope and a prayer that they’ll make it across the choppy, rocky sea. I saw plastic pool floaties that parents put on small children, hoping that would be enough to save them if the raft went down.  And I met a 7-year-old girl – younger than my own granddaughters – who had been sent out on that perilous journey alone. I thought about what horrors must have possessed her parents to hand a wad of cash to human smugglers with only the most desperate dream that their little girl would find something better on the other side.       Today, Donald Trump closed the door on that little girl – and on so many others who are running for their lives.  A Muslim ban by any other name is still a Muslim ban.   President Trump’s executive order restricting immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries and freezing admission of refugees – including Syrian refugees – is a betrayal of American values. We are a country of immigrants and refugees, of people fleeing religious persecution and seeking freedom, a country made strong by our diversity and inclusion. The Syrian refugees admitted to the United States last year are children, doctors, teachers, civil engineers, and college students who sought safety from terrorists like ISIS. Turning our back on these refugees because of their religion creates recruiting fodder for ISIS and other terrorist groups that want to escalate a fabricated war between the United States and Islam.   On Holocaust Remembrance Day, we remember what can happen when hatred and fear turns neighbor against neighbor, and when we abandon those in their hour of need. I urge President Trump to embrace policies that reflect America’s core values and to protect our national security by immediately rescinding this executive order.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/senatorelizabethwarren/photos/a.135603796602122.29462.131559043673264/717791658383330/?type=3",NA,38276,2348,9322,5344,25,92,10886,646

It once fooled me, too.   Decades ago, when I was a young law professor, I had what I thought was a clever idea. I'd go take a look at thousands of court documents to find out why families were actually declaring bankruptcy. I was sure that my study would expose tons of people taking advantage of the system – going on shopping sprees at the mall, wasting money on giant TVs and fancy dinners, and then crying to the courts to save them from their own bad financial choices. It's a story Jason Chaffetz would've loved.    Only it wasn't true.   Two other professors and I collected piles of data on the actual families that were filing for bankruptcy. What we found was shocking. These folks weren't lazy cheats. They were hard-working people who sacrificed for their kids and hung on to their spot in the middle class by the very tips of their fingernails – right up until they just couldn’t make it any longer. For most of them, some combination of medical problems, job losses and family break ups turned their lives upside down.       Today, every middle class family in America knows how hard it is to hang on – even with both parents working, it’s hard to make ends meet in a world where wages are flat and with housing, education, and yes, health care costs going through the roof.   We need to do more, so much more, to address the financial squeeze that's crushing our families. But the Republican plan to gut the Affordable Care Act moves in exactly the wrong direction. If it passes, millions of these families will see their health costs skyrocket. Millions will lose coverage entirely for themselves or their kids.

Now he’s clearing out anyone in the Justice Department who doesn’t get in line with the program.   But we still have the rule of law in the United States. Firing respected prosecutors won’t shut down ongoing law enforcement investigations. And the Senate, which confirms US Attorneys, will not allow the President to replace real prosecutors with more political cronies – not without a massive fight.","status",NA,NA,23628,1748,4335,933,58,192,465,4471

But one area where we’ve made real progress is the nuclear deal, which put a lid on Iran’s nuclear program and placed it under monitoring and inspections. Enforcing this deal is better than no deal at all, and even skeptics like Trump’s Secretary of Defense agree. Given what Iran is willing to do, I think it’s easier to counter its provocative actions if it has no nuclear weapon than it would be to keep Iran in check if the country could threaten the world with a nuclear bomb.

Every time we think our President can't go any lower, he goes lower.  I've said it before and I'll say it again: the only thing that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether or not they can handle the job. President Trump just issued an official memo that insults the courage and sacrifices being made by thousands of transgender troops, and he once again proved that he cares more about extreme ideology than military readiness. The President can pretend this decision is about military effectiveness, but it isn't. Banning individuals from serving based on gender identity is shameful and wrong – and it makes America less safe.  Speaking of making America less safe, President Trump and Sheriff Joe Arpaio are two of a kind: both believe the law doesn't apply to them and have used their office to create a platform for racism and bigotry. No one - not Trump and not Arpaio - is above the law.  This is a disgraceful night for President Trump. He has proven that the safety of the American people is the last thing on his mind.","status",NA,NA,39349,3078,6883,787,98,194,4839,7790

Here’s what I’ve been doing about it this week:  1. I Introduced the Freedom from Equifax Exploitation (FREE) Act with Senator Brian Schatz. Our bill gives you more control of your data. Companies like Equifax make billions selling access to your data without your consent, then charge you if you want to stop them. It's nuts. The FREE Act lets you freeze – and unfreeze – access to your credit file at no cost. It's like a free Do Not Call list for your credit data. The idea behind our bill is simple: Equifax doesn't pay you when they sell your data. You shouldn't have to pay them to stop selling it.      2. I also reintroduced the Equal Employment for All Act to prevent employers from asking job applicants for their credit histories. Credit reports are already riddled with errors. The Equifax hack will make it worse. Inaccurate reports shouldn't hurt your job chances. Bad credit doesn’t make you a bad employee. Workers should compete on the merits, not on their credit scores.  3. On top of these bills, I launched investigation into the Equifax breach & credit reporting industry in general. I sent letters to Equifax, the other credit reporting agencies, regulators, and the GAO to figure out how we can reform this broken industry.  The bills and letters this week are just the beginning to hold Equifax accountable. In the meantime, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has a helpful guide to protect yourself.","link","https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/identity-theft-protection-following-equifax-data-breach/","consumerfinance.gov",8476,612,2342,1159,3,37,10,143

Despite promising to fix NAFTA's problems, President Trump and his Administration have failed to fight for workers through the first three rounds. They have failed to get rid of ISDS - the corporate courts in NAFTA that give big businesses their own special rights. And now they are reportedly proposing NAFTA provisions that do nothing to bring back American jobs.     I wrote to the Trump Administration demanding the removal of ISDS from NAFTA. I also wrote a bill with Senator Sherrod Brown and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand to stop states from restricting workers' right to unionize and fight for fair wages.

Now that there’s a Republican President who’s committed to tilting our courts further in favor of the rich and the powerful, Republicans are looking to fill our courts with judges who share that commitment. This week, the GOP-controlled Senate will vote on the nominations of Steven Grasz, Donny Willett, and James Ho to sit on the federal courts of appeals. Grasz is one of the few nominees to be rated “not qualified” by the American Bar Association, and the records of all three nominees show that they will favor powerful interests over workers, women, LGBTQ individuals, people of color, and religious minorities. We need to fight for judges that protect the rights of all Americans, not just the wealthy and the well-connected.
