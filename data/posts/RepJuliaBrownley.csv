Pay inequality is more than a women’s issue, it is a family issue. Forty percent of households with children include a mother who is either the sole or primary breadwinner, and two-thirds of families depend on the mother’s income to make ends meet. It is not just a matter of fairness, but the key to ensuring that families can make ends meet, pay the mortgage, and put food on their tables. Wage discrimination also has real consequences, including impacting the ability to buy homes, save for a child’s college education, or retirement.   That is why I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act of 2017 – which would help us enforce existing law that makes wage discrimination illegal. The Paycheck Fairness Act would increase penalties for employers who violate the Fair Labor Standards Act, and would protect employees from retaliation for sharing their wage information with one another or for pursuing a wage discrimination case.

With passage of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, Congress took decisive action to prevent another meltdown. Going forward, many experts – including former Chairman Barney Frank who wrote the original law -- agree that the law needs to be improved so that new regulations are not overly burdensome on our nation’s financial institutions. However, the so-called ‘Financial CHOICE Act’ suggests that the Republicans in Congress have completely forgotten that the financial meltdown ever existed. It’s shocking in its disregard for not only our economic stability and security, but in its refusal to recognize the devastation the meltdown inflicted on America’s working families.","link","http://thehill.com/policy/finance/337004-house-passes-sweeping-bill-to-strip-post-recession-banking-rules","thehill.com",68,42,53,2,2,8,8,121

""On the morning of February 3rd he asked his nurse for medication to treat anxiety. The nurse left his room for at least 14 minutes during which time he suffered cardiac arrest. When he was discovered unconscious, the hospital had all people on deck in an attempt to revive him. His heart was restarted but the damage had been done: Josh suffered anoxic brain injury.

With it he can continue to receive the care he needs that will give him a chance to regain back a significant portion of his life and once again be a productive member of society.  ""Even if I sold my house and everything I built my whole life working in the motion picture industry, I still wouldn’t have been able to afford his care.

Around 66,000 veterans were treated for opioid addiction at the VA in fiscal year 2016, and the number of veterans living with opioid issues grew by 55 percent between 2010 and 2015. Treatment can also be more complex for veterans, as many are also dealing with co-occurring factors such as depression, PTS, trauma, or homelessness.

After ECMO, she fought through four surgeries and was so fragile for two years. A common cold could have killed her.   “The total cost of the hospital stay was $2 million.   “I had to shut down my small business indefinitely to care for her 24/7. Even with my husband’s good employer-based insurance, if the ACA hadn’t become law, our Sammy might have never gotten the care she needed to stay alive because of pre-existing conditions and lifetime caps, and we would probably be broke.  “Medicaid and the waiver program were our lifelines that provided the funding for the in-home nursing and care Sammy needed.  “Today, Sammy is healthy and well. She loves to read, float on ocean waves, ride horses, and can communicate in American Sign Language and English. But we still rely on Medicaid/Medi-Cal for her occupational, speech, and physical therapy; in-home support services; and other school services that allow her to continue living an independent and productive life.

As the Executive Director of La Hermandad Hank Lacayo Youth and Family Center, Alicia leads the organization’s efforts to address the inequalities facing our community’s immigrant families, children, and senior citizens. From helping people navigate the process toward citizenship to providing legal assistance to victims of domestic violence, Alicia works to serve those most vulnerable in our community and advocate for social justice. Alicia immigrated to the United States with her family as a child. She went from working in the strawberry and tomato fields in Oxnard as a high school student, to becoming a small business owner, to ultimately finding her passion in non-profit and advocacy work. Now, as a naturalized citizen, Alicia aims to provide other immigrants the same opportunities that were afforded to her in this country.   According to Alicia, “For me being an American is being able to help the community, to empower people to make the country greater than it is now.

This agreement is critical not only to the safety of our ally, Israel, but also to halting a potential nuclear arms race in the Middle East. It included a rigorous inspection regime, the ability to automatically force sanctions back on Iran in the case of its failure to comply with the agreement, and came with the legitimacy and full force of the support of the President of the United States.  It is universally agreed – including by President Trump’s Defense Secretary, Secretary of State, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff – that the Iranians have complied with the terms of the agreement thus far. It is clear that the agreement significantly reduced Iran’s ability to acquire nuclear weapons, which inarguably has made the United States and the world safer.  President Trump’s unilateral move to decertify Iran’s compliance with the agreement – with no evidence whatsoever – not only diminishes America’s leadership in the world, destabilizes the Middle East, and makes Israel less safe, but it also makes it significantly more difficult for any country to trust that an agreement with the United States, especially with respect to nuclear nonproliferation, is legitimate.  While Congress must continue to use every tool available to halt Iran’s support of terrorism, we also must uphold this agreement, despite this very reckless action by President Trump.","link","https://juliabrownley.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/brownley-statement-on-iran-nuclear-deal","juliabrownley.house.gov",133,46,13,6,2,0,1,5

Castillo.  Judge Castillo is a pioneer in the California judiciary, and became the first Latina to sit on the Ventura County Superior Court in June 2016. For over a decade, she has tirelessly served our community and its people through the justice system. She served as a court commissioner prior to becoming appointed by Governor Brown as a Superior Court Judge, where she oversaw hearings involving domestic violence, civil harassment, workplace violence, transitional housing, custody, and child and spousal support.  Prior to serving on the bench, she was a fierce advocate on behalf of some of the most vulnerable populations, including our veterans and people who are homeless, in her former capacity as a Ventura County Deputy Public Defender. Throughout her career, Judge Castillo has worked on thousands of cases. She has fought to ensure that the values of fairness and justice are upheld, and our legal system and the community she serves are better because of it.  Judge Castillo is a graduate of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the Thomas Jefferson School of Law, and the University of Oxford, where she earned a certificate in international human rights law and the international rights of women.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/RepJuliaBrownley/photos/a.340675162700846.1073741827.330504617051234/1169046989863655/?type=3",NA,155,12,9,20,0,1,0,0

Their giveaway to the rich eliminates deductions that are critical for middle-class families in California, including the state and local income tax deduction, the medical expense deduction, the student loan interest deduction, and the dependent care credit. They also limit the property tax deduction and the mortgage interest deduction for future homebuyers.   The message this bill sends to middle-class Americans is loud and clear: If you want to go to school to better your education, you have a child in daycare, you are buying a home for your family for the first time, or you have major medical expenses from cancer or other life-threatening conditions, Republicans don’t care.  This windfall for the 1% also forces our country deeper into debt – putting more pressure on Medicare and Social Security and sticking our grandchildren with the bill. Despite Republicans’ claims, most reasonable economists say that tax cuts funded by adding to the deficit are not the path to economic growth.  We know a scam when we see one.

Unfortunately, the tax bill that House Republicans passed today doesn’t do that.  Instead, this scam gives a massive tax cut to the very wealthy and large corporations that outsource jobs at the expense of seniors, veterans, parents, homeowners, students, and middle-class families. The truth is that millions of Americans will see tax increases if this bill becomes law. It’s especially bad here in California, where 28 percent of taxpayers – mostly middle-class families – will see their taxes go up.  This bill also adds another $1.5 trillion, plus the added interest payments, to the national debt – endangering Medicare and Social Security for our seniors and sticking our children and grandchildren with the bill.  Unfortunately, the Senate version of the bill is even worse. It is going to drive up healthcare premiums for working families and would be even more costly for California’s middle-class families because it also ends the property tax deduction.

How we face the good, and the bad, is a reflection of who we are as a people. Nothing puts this into starker clarity for me than the horrific fire we faced this past month in our community.   The Thomas Fire is the largest wildfire officially recorded in California history. Thousands of people were forced to evacuate, homes and livelihoods were destroyed, and most tragic of all – two lives were lost to this terrifying blaze. I cannot even begin to comprehend the firestorm of terror faced by so many of our friends and neighbors, nor can I quantify the magnitude of loss that they are facing as they return to where homes and businesses once stood. The impact on the lives of so many is palpable as I travel across Ventura County.   But through this disaster, we must take note of the heroism, generosity, and caring that also came from our community. First and foremost, it was brought out by the dedication of our brave first responders. Federal, state, and local officials exhibited exceptional teamwork, moving quickly into action to save lives. They went with few breaks and even less sleep to help keep our community safe. Thank you to all of the public safety officials, including many who came from far away counties and states to help support this effort. We also must thank the families of these officers – so many of whom had their own homes in harm’s way. And most importantly, we must express our deepest gratitude and sorrow to the family of firefighter Cory Iverson. His sacrifice will not be forgotten, and his bravery is an inspiration to us all.   The strength and character of our community was also brought out by the countless neighbors helping neighbors. From texts and calls warning of the fire, to support at the evacuation centers, to the donations that poured in from across the region, the true heart of Ventura County – a giving, caring, and generous heart – was on display during the Thomas Fire.   In addition to a time for reflection, the new year is also a time for renewal. January 1 happens to be the day on which the County of Ventura was formed back in 1873. I think it is especially appropriate this year to celebrate the birthday of our county, and its beautiful landscape and remarkable people, as a day of rebirth as we start a new year and the process of rebuilding and recovering.   So as we rebuild from this tragedy, I wish everyone a happy new year and a 2018 that is filled with joy, prosperity, and light.","status",NA,NA,44,2,1,4,0,0,0,0

Millions more joined in sister marches throughout the world, including one here in Ventura County. It was a powerful, historic moment and I’m proud that it will be on display as a piece of living history at the museum.

It will ensure that every VA facility has a succession plan in place.  In recent years, VA facilities in the Greater Los Angeles region, including the Oxnard CBOC, have experienced significant turnover of senior leadership, which in turn has negatively impacted veterans care. My amendment ensures that VA succession planning doesn’t overlook our local facilities. High-quality and consistent leadership at all VA facilities is vital to help ensure that our veterans get the quality care they have earned.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepJuliaBrownley/videos/997909736977382/",NA,327,45,30,29,0,0,0,0
