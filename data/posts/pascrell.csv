The President rushed to issue the first version of this immoral, unconstitutional ban on refugees and individuals from Muslim-majority nations with unsubstantiated claims that it was vital to strengthen our national security. When that claim was challenged in the courts, no evidence could be produced.  Last week it was reported the Administration did not want to issue this ban because it would step on positive coverage of the President‚Äôs speech. If this ban was really needed to prevent against potential terrorists from entering the United States, the Administration would have provided details of the threats to the courts and done everything they could to implement a new one as fast as possible. However, they did not.  Today‚Äôs ban targeting Muslims and refugees is nothing more than a sequel to the first horror show. It repackages a false narrative about people from Muslim-majority nations that has been disputed by the Department of Homeland Security.  Further, there have been zero fatal terror attacks on U.S. soil since 1975 by immigrants from the Muslim-majority countries this ban focuses on. Facts are the best basis for effective policy. We cannot scapegoat groups of people because of where they are from and what religion they practice.

And when people finally get to the point that they're ready to seek treatment, many turn to Medicaid to be able to afford the help they need.  In 2014, one study showed that Medicaid was the source of about 25 percent of all projected public and private spending for drug abuse treatment - about $7.9 billion.  Consider James Suber from Paterson. Mr. Suber began seeking treatment when New Jersey expanded its Medicaid program and provided more comprehensive access to treatment.  Each morning, Mr. Suber receives treatment at Paterson Counseling Center, which allows him to go to work as a cleaner at Well of Hope, another treatment center in Paterson serving the homeless.  Without the treatment he receives through Medicaid, he wouldn‚Äôt be working. He would be using the emergency department at St. Joseph‚Äôs Hospital. Or maybe he wouldn't have survived.

So not only is this Republican argument a fallacy, today we learning of its hypocrisy.  Republicans, indeed, are seeking to cut a deal with extremists by removing the Essential Health Benefits requirement, which mandates that insurers cover hospital, outpatient, emergency and maternity care, as well as prescription-drugs and mental health/substance abuse treatment.  By offering to remove the EHB protection at the 11th hour, Republicans expose their disingenuous talking points by supporting a return to the days when insurance companies were at the center of the patient‚Äôs care, free to discriminate against the elderly, the sick, and women.  Under this giveaway, insurance companies would be able to manipulate their benefit packages to quarantine the sick and elderly into their own risk pool, forcing ever-increasing premiums and deductibles on those who need care the most; others would have to buy skimpy and inadequate policies.

Rather than coming together with Democrats to make basic fixes to the ACA Marketplaces, they opted for a ""repeal"" plan centered around gutting Medicaid and shifting costs onto vulnerable populations in order to give a windfall to the wealthy.     The Administration has already begun deregulating insurers, causing confusion, and shifting costs onto consumers ‚Äì and President Trump has all but announced that he want to ""let Obamacare fail.""

The agreement allowed each participating country the ability to determine their own the policies and emission reductions techniques. Through a combination of peer pressure and reputational risks, this agreement was a giant first step to getting every nation to take ownership over their carbon emissions in a non-legally binding way.  President Trump‚Äôs reflexive opposition to this simple idea, science, and pretty much anything President Obama put his hands on takes another page out of the Republican Party‚Äôs extreme-right wing playbook. This decision further confirms that no one inside of this administration can moderate the propaganda pushed by anti-climate hard liners like Administrator Scott Pruitt, who have sowed seeds of suspicion of international agreements.  While President Trump may not have a problem risking his reputation by pulling out of agreements, this is an abdication of American leadership and calls into question our nation‚Äôs credibility. As the world‚Äôs largest economy and second-largest carbon polluter, this pullout leaves the United States standing with Syria and Nicaragua on the sidelines of historic progress. Our nation will be contributing to extreme heat waves, damaging storms, coastal flooding, and severe droughts that create risks to food security because of this reckless decision. Further, this move cedes the strategic influence we achieved in Paris to other rising powers around the world.","status",NA,NA,55,21,10,0,0,0,17,18

However, with the rhetoric and actions of this administration, including the new endorsement of this callous legislation that slashes legal immigration levels, we are losing sight of the bedrock of our nation.   By making it more difficult for families to come to the United States and focusing on language skills, this legislation would hurt our ability to find immigrants who want to come to America and integrate into our society. Finally, this bill needlessly caps the number of refugees able to come into our country during the worst refugee crisis the world has ever seen. Immigrants help boost the economy and they commit crimes at lower levels than native-born Americans.

As a response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks by al-Qaida, the War in Afghanistan has led to more than 2,300 U.S. service members paying the ultimate price, tens of thousands more wounded, and cost over $1 trillion in taxpayer dollars. In light of these facts, President Trump‚Äôs General plan is questionable at best and a fool‚Äôs errand at worst. By putting more brave soldiers at risk, the President owes the American people clarity on their mission, and a concrete plan to ensure resources will be available for these troops abroad and when they return home. Should the U.S. decide to move ahead with increasing our commitment, we must establish a clear timeline for withdrawal and a clear justification for the U.S.‚Äôs continued presence in Afghanistan, with explicitly-stated goals. President Trump must also establish accountability objectives so the American people know what ‚Äúwinning‚Äù looks like, clarity missing from tonight‚Äôs speech.   Ending the war in Afghanistan will take a multipronged approach that includes working with a broad coalition of partners. The fact is that ending America‚Äôs longest war will come about through political not military means. Proposed budget cuts to the State Department budget, countless unfilled positions, and the planned radical restructuring of the department will not help.   The sacrifices of our men and women in combat and their families over the span of this conflict have been priceless contributions to security in our homeland and to freedom worldwide. But without a robust debate on the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, the Congress continues to cede its Constitutional authority to the executive branch. Republican Leadership must not abdicate congressional responsibility and should allow the House of Representatives a full debate on a new AUMF now.","status",NA,NA,69,28,7,1,0,0,9,4

The Cassidy-Graham bill would end the ACA‚Äôs Medicaid expansion and the tax credits people get to help them purchase insurance. The bill would temporarily give states an inadequate amount of federal funding for health care ‚Äì with no requirement that the funding be used to help lower-income and middle class families afford coverage; no requirement that insurance companies continue to offer coverage and protections to people with pre-existing conditions; and no requirement that insurance companies offer coverage for the services that people need, like mental health treatment. Under this bill, New Jersey would see its federal health dollars cut by over $8.54 billion in the next 10 years.  In addition to repealing the ACA without replacing it with something that will offer people the quality, affordable health coverage they need, Cassidy-Graham would also fundamentally restructure Medicaid in a way that will result in deep cuts to the program relied on by millions of seniors, children, and individuals with disabilities.  Just like all of the ACA repeal bills before it, Cassidy-Graham is not health care reform. It‚Äôs taking health care away from millions in a desperate attempt to fulfill a political promise. This bill is not worthy of any Member‚Äôs support and certainly will not have mine if it comes before the House of Representatives.  Every Republican Congressman in New Jersey knows quite well how this bill would effect peoples' pocketbooks and they cannot vote in good conscience for this bill. If they do vote for this bill, they should be thrown out of office.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/pascrell/photos/a.10152503442649156.1073741826.303312929155/10155696711634156/?type=3",NA,32,14,7,0,0,1,0,10

Unfortunately, my amendment failed. I obviously share the goal of increasing employment and earnings across the country. However, home visiting is not an employment program. And this bill provides no new funding, so any resources devoted to supporting employment would have to be diverted from MIECHV‚Äôs core purposes.  It is a program to strengthen families to make kids healthier, safer, and more ready to learn when they start school. Those are the outcomes home visiting models strive for, and those are the outcomes they achieve.  In Passaic County, our home visiting program worked with a pregnant mom expecting a child with a heart defect. The baby required open heart surgery shortly after he was born last July. After the surgery the newborn continued to have health complications and at times his mom felt depressed and hopeless and feared that her child was not going to survive.  The home visiting program‚Äôs Family Support Worker was able to assist the mom by connecting her to services, providing her with emotional support, and acting as a liaison with the hospital.  We know the negative impact that post-partum depression can have on new moms and their babies, and the home visiting program was able to connect this mom to supportive resources and alleviate her depression so that she could be a healthy and present mother. I‚Äôm happy to report that after nearly three months in the hospital, this little boy was finally able to go home and his mom continues to work with the home visiting program in northern New Jersey.   Now, I don‚Äôt think anyone can hear that story and not see value in the services that were provided.  This home visiting program helped a mom navigate her newborn son‚Äôs health care crisis and manage the mental health issues associated with it.  But under the provision that my amendment is seeking to strike from the bill, this outcome would not be measured as a success. There‚Äôs something wrong with that.  Most home visiting models focus on families with newborns or very small children, and focus on building a parent-child bond. Many home visiting programs focus on teen parents and young mothers, and the priority is to keep them in school and make sure they continue their education.   There are currently 18 evidence-based home visiting models. None of them provide employment services, none of them measure employment and earnings.  Home visitors have raised concerns that having to ask families about employment and earnings would be intrusive, and would undermine the relationship they are trying to build with families. Even if the data is collected without specifically asking the families for it, knowing their performance is being measured based on their clients‚Äô labor force participation will likely make home visitors feel that they have to press their clients to work ‚Äì even if, like the case of the mom in Passaic County, that shouldn‚Äôt be the main objective.","link","http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/home-visiting-proven-family-support-needs-action-from_us_59a98dd7e4b0c50640cd5efc","huffingtonpost.com",13,4,0,1,0,0,0,0

That couldn‚Äôt have been further from the truth. I voted no on this aid package because it is not good enough for our fellow citizens, especially those in Puerto Rico. It is pathetic for House Republicans to call this package a disaster supplemental. This week Congressional Republicans added over a trillion dollars to the deficit to finance tax cuts for the wealthiest in our nation. Yet, yesterday House Republicans could not figure out how to provide those suffering from national disasters with the resources they need. Splitting up $81 billion between Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Florida, Texas, and areas impacted by wildfires barely scratches the surface of what is needed to help the families in these communities recover. I will continue to fight for more resources so those suffering in natural disaster areas are able to recover.","link","http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/12/house_limits_femas_ability_to_demand_repayments_from_disaster_victims.html","nj.com",32,1,3,1,0,0,0,1
