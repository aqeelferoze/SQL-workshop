The 45th time in our country's grand experiment that we have had a peaceful transfer of power, an example once again to the world. Today we are all Americans and we all have a new President. I will fight alongside him in the many places where we agree.  We will fight to cut taxes and spending, to end the heavy regulatory burden on American businesses, and to bring the federal government under control. We will fight for a stronger, smarter and most importantly, Constitutional foreign policy.  There will be areas of disagreement, but those are for another day. Once every four years, I don't think it is too great an ask to simply stand together as Americans, in awe of the great country and traditions our founders gave to us.  Rest assured though, I will stand for the values we share no matter who is President or which party controls Congress.  I was pleased to share today's events with my wife Kelley and my youngest son, Robert. If you have the chance, I hope you share your thoughts today with your friends and family and encourage them to watch, participate and help guard our great country and its freedoms.  There are those who seek to further divide us, or report breathlessly on every division. Our country has some passionate divisions but it is nothing we haven't seen or handled before, media reports to the contrary. I will leave you with the words of Abraham Lincoln in his first Inaugural.  ""The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.""

For example, in 2013, I took to the Senate floor for 13 hours to force then-Attorney General Eric Holder to answer a question on the extent of the president’s “national security powers”: “Does the president have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?”   Eric Holder answered clearly, “No.”    It is of the utmost importance for the Attorney General to recognize there are fundamental limits to presidential power.  When I contacted Jeff Sessions to ask him the same question, he affirmed that he held this same position.    One of the most important duties of a senator is providing advice and consent to the president’s nominees.    We don't pick the nominees; we consent to their qualifications.  As Senator Sessions agrees with the president, is of good character, and upheld the doctrine protecting American citizens, I voted to confirm him today.","status",NA,NA,3110,379,237,163,4,3,99,89

Yesterday I met with 30+ Kentuckians in Grayson county affected by the US Army Corps of Engineers' proposed changes to the Flowage Easement Encroachment Resolution Plan for Rough River Lake. I have been working on assisting the community with this issue and wanted to meet with these folks in person to discuss the problem in more detail and come up with a plan of action that addresses their needs. I look forward to continuing to advocate for the Rough River Lake community on this issue and am hopeful we can prevent the Corps from enacting changes that threaten the homes of so many Kentuckians in this area.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenatorRandPaul/photos/a.435771833142292.117847.161355253917286/1501915076527957/?type=3",NA,413,41,39,18,0,1,0,0
