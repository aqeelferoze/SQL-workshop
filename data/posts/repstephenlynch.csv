By allowing foreign governments to grant personal financial benefits directly to the President and to companies that his family owns, President-elect Trump is putting our democracy at risk. This is in blatant disregard for the Constitution and his ambivalence towards promptly addressing these troubling conflict of interest issues is a distraction from the important work that lies before us. Alexander Hamilton made it clear in the Federalist papers that a ""weak side in republics, among their numerous advantages, is that, they afford too easy an inlet to foreign corruption."" Thankfully, Hamilton and our other Founding Fathers had the sense more than two centuries ago to safeguard our democracy from corruption with the emoluments clause which prohibits the President from accepting personal financial gain from foreign governments. Hopefully, the President-elect will abide by the Constitution and place the office of the Presidency beyond such reproach.  http://lynch.house.gov/press-release/rep-lynch-joins-31-house-democrats-introduce-resolution-urging-trump-comply","link","http://lynch.house.gov/press-release/rep-lynch-joins-31-house-democrats-introduce-resolution-urging-trump-comply","lynch.house.gov",728,355,59,50,0,1,0,5

Many families across the 8th Congressional District are faced with the devastating impacts of a loved one struggling with addiction. I have seen firsthand the value of increasing funding for the drug courts program – these drug courts save the lives and futures of men and women struggling with substance abuse; they help the friends and families of these individuals who are desperately trying to get their loved ones help; and they save taxpayers money by reducing recidivism. In the 114th Congress, I advocated for increased funding for drug courts during the appropriations process and you have my word that I will do the same in the 115th Congress.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repstephenlynch/photos/a.133728250029455.24112.133720816696865/1164930820242521/?type=3",NA,70,7,3,0,0,0,0,0

This morning, Town Councilor Becky Haugh and I did a walk through at the site of the gas leak.

The letter, signed by 106 House Democrats, raised strong concerns that a government-wide hiring freeze would decrease transparency, efficiency, and accountability in the federal government. There is no question that we need to reduce costs within our government, but a hiring freeze will do the opposite. Mr. Trump’s plan will merely increase the number of private contractors and negatively affect the traditional federal employees who keep our agencies running. From protecting our national security to providing healthcare to veterans, Americans depend on federal employees each and every day. We should be strengthening the federal workforce by increasing efficiency and ensuring agencies are fulfilling their missions, rather than implementing a devastating hiring freeze that will increase backlogs, decrease the quality of service, and raise contracting costs.  http://lynch.house.gov/press-release/lynch-leads-106-democrats-calling-trump-reconsider-federal-hiring-freeze","link","http://lynch.house.gov/press-release/lynch-leads-106-democrats-calling-trump-reconsider-federal-hiring-freeze","lynch.house.gov",154,29,26,9,1,0,1,4

We are certainly facing a moment of trepidation in politics in our country. Not surprisingly, Dr. King’s life and work offer some guidance on how we face that anxiety and fear. With the change in administration next week, it is essential that we remain vigilant in calling for accountability in our elected representatives. Sometimes we forget that the drafters of our Constitution were obsessed with a fear of tyranny so they created a system of separation of power and checks and balances. We are going to test that system come January 20th and you have my word that the legislative branch will be working hard to demand that the laws are followed and prevent any executive overreach. As President Obama said in his farewell address this week, “regardless of the station we occupy; we have to try harder; to start with the premise that each of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do; that they value hard work and family like we do; that their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our own.” It is important that we come together in our local communities striving to make our cities and towns a more tolerant and better place to live, work, and raise a family.

To not let the recent election discourage you in our electoral process, but inspire you to serve at the local, state, and federal level. Your work inspires our young people to become the next generation of community leaders. At this morning’s breakfast, I recognized the keynote speaker, Dr. Joshua Lumumba Okallo.

Lynch","2017-02-07","2017-02-07 14:05:15","At last night's Weymouth Town Council meeting, I raised concerns about the recent gas leak on Spectra's watch. The most troubling aspect is that I got the notice of the gas leak from the neighbors, not from Spectra. The smell of the odor agent is proof positive of a gas leak. The odor agent worked. People smelled it and called the Weymouth Fire Department who responded very quickly. We may have an adversarial relationship with Spectra due to the fight over the proposed compressor station. I’m convinced it is a dangerous proposition. That should not make us less demanding. Spectra's Weymouth facility needs to be run properly. We should demand it as neighbors and as citizens. The gas leak did not build confidence in the neighbors who were exposed to it. We should keep a running track record of Spectra's actions. I would like the chief public safety officer of the Commonwealth to do an investigation about whether this facility is being operated properly. We must make sure that if there is a danger there that we mitigate it as much as possible with robust enforcement of the law. We need built-in checks and balances in Spectra’s organization. We shouldn't be dependent on neighbors notifying the fire department. We have a good team of public officials working to protect affected communities. We can provide the maximum amount of protection under the law.  http://www.patriotledger.com/news/20170207/officials-blast-spectra-over-gas-valve-monitoring-after-leak","link","http://www.patriotledger.com/news/20170207/officials-blast-spectra-over-gas-valve-monitoring-after-leak","patriotledger.com",48,5,12,2,0,0,0,0

Our dedicated service men and women fought to protect our freedoms and defend our homeland. We are grateful for their service and thankful when veterans return home and choose to continue their public service by entering the federal workforce. President Trump’s federal hiring freeze not only hurts everyday Americans seeking a prompt response from a federal agency but also makes it difficult for veterans looking for employment in the federal government across the country. With veterans making up more than 30% of the federal workforce and new hires at the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Transportation, and other agencies nationwide, America’s returning service men and women will be disproportionately affected by President Trump’s action. Veterans have earned their hiring preference and I am deeply concerned that the federal hiring freeze disproportionately hurts America’s veterans. The Veterans Federal Hiring Protection Act of 2017 would exempt America’s veterans from the hiring freeze and ensure that the federal government will not close its doors to veterans when it comes to employment. I am thankful for the support of the American Legion and Disabled American Veterans as well as 21 of my colleagues in the House.   http://lynch.house.gov/press-release/rep-lynch-introduces-legislation-ensure-federal-government-continues-hire-america%E2%80%99s","link","http://lynch.house.gov/press-release/rep-lynch-introduces-legislation-ensure-federal-government-continues-hire-america%E2%80%99s","lynch.house.gov",328,14,50,22,0,0,0,1

The hiring freeze hurts this young man and many other returning servicemen and women across the country. Gaining bipartisan support for H.R. 1001, the Veterans Federal Hiring Protection Act, is an important way to help put our veterans to work.

We sent a letter to Chairman Chaffetz calling for him to initiate an investigation or step aside so that we can. And the new reports of repeated contact between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence only reaffirm our numerous calls for an oversight investigation into the Russian hacking. This week, I cosponsored Congressman Nadler’s Resolution of Inquiry, which would force a floor vote directing the Department of Justice to provide the House of Representatives all information relevant to an inquiry into President Trump and his associates’ conflicts of interests, ethical violations, and ties to Russia.

We heard loud and clear from the families we represent that Trumpcare would put their access to healthcare at risk. Trumpcare did not have working families, children, Americans with disabilities, or seniors in mind. Trumpcare would have been a disaster for Massachusetts – potentially jeopardizing coverage for nearly 500,000 Massachusetts residents and costing the Commonwealth nearly $2 billion in federal funding. It would have destroyed Medicaid as we know it and taken funds that seniors depend on from the Medicare Trust Fund. Trumpcare would have defunded Planned Parenthood – putting women’s access to preventative health services, cancer screenings and contraception at risk. House Republicans were focused on tax cuts for the richest Americans, while pushing the cost of healthcare onto middle-income earners and the states. And to make matters worse, they would have dropped Medicaid coverage for substance abuse and mental health services, threatening efforts to address the opioid abuse epidemic across the country. We still need to make high quality healthcare more affordable and accessible for all Americans; Trumpcare would have done the opposite. Since Republican leadership pulled the bill from floor consideration, I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will now take into account how the American people have reacted to their so-called plan and I call for a sincere, bipartisan effort to make needed improvements to the Affordable Care Act. http://lynch.house.gov/press-release/rep-lynch-statement-trumpcare","link","http://lynch.house.gov/press-release/rep-lynch-statement-trumpcare","lynch.house.gov",332,66,36,10,1,0,0,1

Law enforcement agencies are spending millions of dollars on confidential informant programs and Congress does not have information on who these informants are, if they committed any crimes and whether they have been properly vetted. While confidential informants can be a useful investigatory tool, we have seen far too often that the programs can be abused. In response to reports of waste, fraud and abuse in confidential informant programs at law enforcement agencies, it is critical that we enhance congressional oversight of human sources. Today, I introduced H.R. 1857, the Confidential Informant Accountability Act, which will improve transparency, accountability and safety in confidential informant programs. http://lynch.house.gov/press-release/rep-lynch-introduces-confidential-informant-accountability-act","video","https://www.facebook.com/repstephenlynch/videos/1241271585941777/",NA,69,3,10,2,0,0,0,0

Thanks to the initiative and vision of the Town of Weymouth, Neighborworks Southern Mass and Father Bills & MainSpring, veterans who are facing difficult times will have a new resource in the Weymouth area focused on tackling veterans’ homelessness. The Weymouth Veterans Home will offer six units of safe, affordable housing for returning veterans. This residence will also offer on-site resources and supportive services. With the investment of federal, state, and private resources, as well as investments from our nonprofit partners, we now have an incredible resource for our local veterans. I met a young Marine in Baghdad, Iraq last week who was on his ninth tour of duty. That's a record for my Massachusetts men and women in uniform. I believe there is a nexus between the repeat tours of duty and the difficulties that many of our returning veterans experience when making the transition to civilian life.

During my most recent visit to Baghdad last month, I actually met a young Marine who was on his ninth tour of duty in Iraq. After all those tours, a lot of our men and women in uniform are bound to have hidden wounds from near-constant exposure to battlefield stress over extended periods. I honestly believe there is a direct correlation between these highly repetitive tours of duty and the difficulties that many of our returning veterans experience when making the transition to civilian life – including elevated incidence of substance abuse and suicide. PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury are hidden wounds that affect thousands of veterans. A critical way to ease those difficulties is ensuring that our veterans receive high quality, dependable healthcare and find a supportive community when they return home. We have wonderful, dedicated doctors, nurses and staff at the VA, we just need to make sure that they have the tools they need to get this right.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repstephenlynch/photos/a.133728250029455.24112.133720816696865/1289491327786469/?type=3",NA,39,3,8,0,0,0,0,0

With over 3.5 million service men and women serving since the First Gulf War and many serving repeat tours of duty, it is critically important that we ensure we have the healthcare and support systems in place to help with the difficult transition to civilian life. We are seeing a nexus between repeat tours of duty and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury. These health issues can manifest in an elevated incidence of suicide and elevated levels of substance abuse among many of our veterans. And while we are making strides, it remains difficult to diagnose Traumatic Brain Injury, but for veterans with potential cases, it is critically important that we get it right. Last week, I visited the Jamaica Plain Campus of the VA Boston Healthcare System, along with a number of veterans’ stakeholders and advocates, to review the handling of cases of Traumatic Brain Injury and PTSD. Under the leadership of Director Vincent Ng and Doctor Michael Charness, the VA Boston Healthcare System is doing great research and working on the development of countermeasures and protocols to deal with Traumatic Brain Injury and PTSD. We have wonderful, dedicated doctors, nurses, and staff at the VA; we just need to make sure that they have the systems in place to get this right. One way to do that is to continue to develop better tools to diagnose and treat Traumatic Brain Injury by promoting public-private partnerships.

The Trump Administration’s continuing and brazen resistance to ethics transparency impedes necessary oversight by the Office of Government Ethics and decreases public confidence in the executive branch. While President Trump pledged to ‘drain the swamp,’ he has already flooded the White House and other federal agencies with former lobbyists, consultants, and industry attorneys whose previous work in the private sector presents serious conflict of interest concerns. Reports that former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn performed lobbying and consulting activities on behalf of foreign governments prior to his tenure in the White House underscore the importance of requiring the Administration to publicly disclose its decisions to waive its own ethics rules for executive branch officials.

As the Trump Administration weighs expanding military capabilities in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is vital that the Oversight Committee evaluate the soundness of these proposals. With American servicemen and women being sent on to the battlefield overseas, it is critical that the Trump Administration is held accountable for a long-term strategy.  The lack of transparency from the Trump Administration regarding their overall plan hinders Congress’ ability to determine whether deploying thousands of American troops is consistent with the original Authorization for the Use of Military Force granted 14 years ago.

A misguided Trump Administration policy is not going to stop the efforts of Democratic members to conduct oversight. We recently sent a letter invoking the seven member rule to demand documents relating to the Trump Hotel. As I noted to Rolling Stone, it is rare the rule gets used, but we had to go there in this case. We will continue to demand transparency and accountability from the Trump Administration.  http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/democrats-take-on-trumps-conflicts-of-interest-w487575","link","http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/democrats-take-on-trumps-conflicts-of-interest-w487575","rollingstone.com",123,18,17,5,0,0,0,2

Sue Joss works tirelessly to ensure that patients in Brockton and across Massachusetts have access to quality, community health care. We are thankful for her leadership and advocacy for families living across the 8th Congressional District. Community health centers are the family doctor to over 25 million Americans and serve more than 951,000 patients here in Massachusetts. I have seen firsthand the importance of community health centers and the work that they do on a daily basis. Our local community health centers have taken a lead role in addressing the devastating opioid abuse crisis. While our community health centers are working diligently to address this public health crisis, I recognize that they need more support and additional federal funding. That is why in Congress, I have consistently fought for the highest level of funding for the health center program. I hope we can all join together to continue to advocate for this vitally important program so all Americans have access to health services.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/repstephenlynch/photos/a.509292379139705.1073741828.133720816696865/1313707435364858/?type=3",NA,58,0,2,2,0,0,0,1

Without public hearings and with little time for public review and input, Senate Republicans are rushing a proposal crafted behind closed doors to the floor for a vote. After reading the Senate proposal, I have serious concerns hard-working families in Massachusetts may lose access to healthcare coverage they depend on. The Senate proposal would significantly reduce future Medicaid spending; putting funding at risk that Massachusetts depends on. From ensuring young people are healthy enough to go to school each day to providing quality care to people with disabilities as well as offering treatment services for those struggling with opioid abuse, future cuts to Medicaid funding in Massachusetts would have wide-ranging, detrimental impacts on the benefits and services available for families in Massachusetts and across the country. The Senate bill also seeks to significantly raise costs for older Americans, allowing insurers to charge seniors five times as much as younger consumers, making it more expensive for seniors to get the healthcare they need. And the proposal makes it harder for women to access contraceptive services by defunding Planned Parenthood. Healthcare reform ought to make quality healthcare more accessible and affordable. Instead, Senate Republicans are asking everyday Americans to pay more for less coverage, while cutting taxes for wealthy Americans.","status",NA,NA,137,43,23,2,0,1,12,33

Despite statutory requirements for the Federal Aviation Administration to record ownership history and lien information on civil aircraft, some aircraft owners shield their identity by registering aircraft with a trustee – a legal practice, but one that can be vulnerable to abuse, particularly when the FAA does not have information on the trustor, beneficiary, or those using the aircraft. Companies with anonymous or opaque structures can hide beneficial ownership information to mask aircraft ownership posing risks to national security and public safety. A recent report from the Department of Transportation’s Office of Inspector General cited examples of illicit activity tied to aircraft registered on behalf of foreign trustors, underscoring the need for strong beneficial ownership legislation to address dangerous consequences of lapses in beneficial ownership reporting. For example, a U.S. bank, serving as an aircraft trustee, discovered that a U.S. Government-designated terrorist organization financially backed their trustor, a Lebanese politician. In addition, an FAA inspector found a Boeing 737 aircraft operated contrary to U.S. regulations as its foreign trustor leased the aircraft, possibly for illegal revenue, to a rental service basing the plane in the United Arab Emirates. My bipartisan legislation requires the disclosure of beneficial ownership information for aircraft registration to ensure that the FAA has a more complete picture on who owns aircraft prior to approving a certificate of registration in the United States. https://lynch.house.gov/press-release/rep-lynch-introduces-aircraft-ownership-transparency-act-2017","link","https://lynch.house.gov/press-release/rep-lynch-introduces-aircraft-ownership-transparency-act-2017","lynch.house.gov",48,3,3,0,0,0,0,1

Instead, Republicans are helping corporations and the wealthy by jamming the #GOPTaxPlan through Congress.  Here are a few reasons the Republican tax plan should not be passed:  - It hurts middle-class families in Massachusetts by repealing the state and local tax deduction, which is claimed by 1/3 Massachusetts residents. - 36 million middle class working families will see tax increases under the plan. - Homebuyers in Massachusetts would be hit hard by the plan, which would eliminate the mortgage interest deduction above $500k. - It gives tax breaks to corporations on the backs of hard working, middle class Americans. - It will cut $25 billion from Medicare in 2018, hurting seniors and individuals with disabilities across the U.S. - Seniors spend nearly 20% of their income on health care expenses. This plan would eliminate the medical expense deduction many seniors use to get relief from their medical bills. - Many Americans already struggle to afford an education, and this plan would make it even harder by eliminating student loan deductions. - It targets the sick by eliminating medical expense deductions for those who spend more than 10% of their income on medical expenses. - It will lower the corporate tax rate while raising taxes on millions in the middle class.
