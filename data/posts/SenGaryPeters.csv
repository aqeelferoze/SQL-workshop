Their work is a vital part of our national security, and they couldn’t be more deserving of the United States Air Force’s Outstanding Unit Award. I had the opportunity to speak with these brave men and women remotely while I was in Afghanistan last month & see some of their incredible work up close. Congrats to the 110th Attack Wing on this recognition, and thank you for all you do to keep us safe!","link","http://bit.ly/2zP5pkm","bit.ly",336,35,45,28,0,9,0,0
