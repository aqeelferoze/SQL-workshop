We talked about what we can try to do to preserve the Affordable Care Act, a law that has brought health care to 20 million Americans. Right now, Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans are trying to #MakeAmericaSickAgain by ripping up the ACA (before coming up with a meaningful replacement plan, mind you) and take us back to the days where if you got a serious illness or disease, you either got kicked off your plan or couldn’t sign up for one.   As a member of the Senate Health Committee, I recognize how painful repeal could be for people all across Minnesota—particularly in rural communities, who often face unique challenges in accessing health care services. Fifty-seven million Americans live in rural areas, and if we dismantle the ACA, we face the risk that many of their local hospitals and health providers could be forced to close their doors. We can’t let that happen. So I’m going to be fighting hard in the days and weeks to come—not to repeal the ACA without a plan, but to make the case that we have to build on, amend, and improve the law in order to expand coverage and bring down costs for American families.","status",NA,NA,5199,613,642,404,2,10,78,278

But that’s exactly what’s happening to many seniors across the country. During my “Prescription Drug Cost Listening Tour” last year, Minnesota seniors told me some heartbreaking stories about how they've been forced to make difficult decisions—either deplete their savings or forgo medications that jeopardize their well-being. Not only are these high out-of-pocket costs affecting patients, they are driving up health insurance premiums and overall spending. In fact, according to a new report released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, skyrocketing drug prices are actually putting the future of the entire Medicare Part D program at risk. And a big part of the problem is that Medicare is barred from negotiating with drug companies for lower prices, which is a policy I’ve fought to change for a long time. That’s why I’ve written commonsense, cost-saving legislation to let Medicare negotiate better deals for our seniors. It’s not just the smart thing to do—it’s the right thing to do.  https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-16-00270.pdf","link","https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-16-00270.pdf","oig.hhs.gov",3551,378,577,109,1,23,378,244

Only this time the president got more specific. It wasn’t just millions of illegal votes—this time he said it was somewhere between 3 million and 5 million fraudulent votes. I wonder how he came up with 3 million illegal votes. Could it have anything to do with the fact that he lost by 2.86 million votes?   This is beyond outrageous. This is profoundly disturbing. The President went on to repeat this lie on Twitter and on television before calling for a “major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!”  Now, President Trump tweeted that before he knew that among those registered to vote in two states are his chief strategist, Steve Bannon; his press secretary, Sean Spicer; his nominee for Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin; his daughter, Tiffany Trump; and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.   Nonetheless, President Trump later announced that he would sign an executive order related to voter fraud. This raises serious concerns. And before the members of this Committee vote on Senator Sessions’ nomination, we deserve to know whether the president intends for the attorney general or the Justice Department to lead this investigation.   When the President of the United States lies about the existence of massive, widespread fraud, it’s the job of the attorney general to call him out on it. The attorney general has an obligation to tell it like it is. Senator Sessions may have said it best himself. When Sally Yates was nominated to be the Deputy Attorney General, Senator Sessions questioned her during her confirmation hearing. He said, “you have to watch out because people will be asking you to do things, and you'll just need to say no. Do you think the Attorney General has a responsibility to say no to the president if he asks for something that's improper? A lot of people have defended the Lynch nomination, for example, by saying well, he appoints somebody who's gonna execute his views, what's wrong with that? But if the views the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General say no?”   Ms. Yates responded, quote “Senator, I believe that the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General has an obligation to follow the law and the Constitution and to give their independent legal advice to the president.” And as everyone here should agree, that’s exactly what Ms. Yates did on Monday night. This nation owes her a debt of gratitude. But Chairman Grassley, Senator Sessions has not demonstrated that he is capable of fulfilling that same obligation. Before this Committee votes to advance his nomination, it’s important that we know whether Senator Sessions is able—or willing—to separate fact from fiction and speak truth to power.

If you need a refresher (or for those of you who may not know, a quick explanation), here it is:   Set-top boxes are clunky devices that your cable company forces you to rent so you can watch your favorite show, and each American household spends on average over $200 per year to rent a set-top box. So for large cable companies, forcing people to rent set-top boxes siphons about $20 billion each year from the pockets of hard working families. In the past, I've called on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to give consumers a meaningful choice in how they access the content they pay for. Instead of renting a set-top box, I believe consumers should be able to access the full content of their cable subscription via an app—just like Netflix, Hulu, or HBO GO—at no additional charge. Just imagine how much more convenient that would be—you could use the app with your smartphone, tablet, smart TV, or with your Roku, Apple TV, Chromecast, or Amazon Fire Stick.

If Mrs. DeVos’s performance didn’t convince you that she lacks the qualifications for this job, what would have had to happen in that hearing in order to convince you?    If you cannot bring yourself to vote against this nominee, is there anyone President Trump could nominate for any position who you could vote against?

Minnesotans told me that skyrocketing drug prices are forcing them to make difficult decisions about their daily lives—choosing between paying bills, buying groceries, or taking medications. I’ve listened to their concerns, and—as a member of the Senate Health Committee—I’ve introduced legislation that would bring down the cost of prescription drugs for our seniors by allowing Medicare to negotiate better deals with drug manufacturers. This is something that I’ve been fighting to get done since I joined the Senate, and even President Trump has publicly expressed support for this policy. So I’m hopeful that we can finally pass my commonsense bill into law.

This order affected innocent people like Minnesotan Samira Dahir, who was set to be reunited with her four-year-old daughter until President Trump issued his directive, preventing her child from coming to the United States from Uganda. Both Senator Amy Klobuchar and I called Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly to intervene, and thankfully after a several-day ordeal, she was able to travel to the US to be with her mom and older sisters.

Tom Price's ability to put Americans above his own self-interest as Health and Human Services Secretary. I brought up how Minnesotans are worried that he’ll take families back to when they were just one injury or illness away from facing bankruptcy. I talked about Minnesotans like Leanna and her three-year-old son named Henry. Henry has been diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, and his treatment will last until at least April of 2018. Henry often needs around-the-clock care to manage his nausea, vomiting, pain, and sleepless nights, and his immune system is so weak that he’s not supposed to go to day care, so Leanna left her job to take care of him. Leanna’s family is supported by her spouse. But they couldn’t pay for Henry’s treatment on one salary. Leanna says “it is because of the ACA that Henry gets proper health care. Henry can get therapy and the things he needs to maintain his health and work towards beating cancer. Henry is still with us because of the ACA.”  Let me say that again: “Henry is still with us because of the ACA.”  What have I seen from Republicans like Congressman Price to make sure that Leanna, Henry, and the hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans who have gained coverage don’t lose the care they need?  A whole lot of nothing. What I have been able to see Congressman Price advocate for, so far, is pretty awful. His proposals would strip away coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, strip away preventive health benefits, strip away protections from annual and lifetime limits, and strip away coverage for young adults.   I’m disappointed that his views on health care—and his conflicted financial investments and affiliation with conspiracy-theory-peddling-extremists—weren’t enough of a disqualifier for my GOP colleagues.

Last year, an important federal program called “Lifeline” began offering support to help millions of low-income families, military veterans, and seniors in Minnesota and across the country gain access to affordable broadband. But last week, the new Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission appointed by President Trump—Ajit Pai—decided to forbid nine internet providers from helping these communities.   By law, the FCC has an obligation to ensure “consumers in all regions of the country, including low-income consumers” have access to “advanced telecommunications services.” I believe that Ajit Pai should do more to abide by that obligation.

If President Trump really wants to drain the swamp, here’s what I suggest: stop doing things that set us up for another economic meltdown, quit installing Wall Street executives in your cabinet, and reverse course on your plan to gut Dodd-Frank, the law that helped us rein in Wall Street after they crippled the economy in 2008.","status",NA,NA,5525,532,727,224,17,38,99,841

And that’s on top of the already troubling revelation that General Michael Flynn, the President’s disgraced former National Security Advisor who was forced to resign his post earlier this week, lied about speaking with the Russian Ambassador about the prospect of easing U.S. sanctions against Russia.   Let me be very clear: Russia wants to subvert our democracy and its close ties with the President and his staff raise several red flags. And while I’m relieved that General Flynn no longer has the President’s ear, I don’t believe that this case is anywhere near closed.   We must pursue independent, bipartisan, and comprehensive investigations into what the Trump Administration knew about General Flynn’s problematic contact with Russia, when they knew it, why the public was misled, and whether or not Flynn was ordered to discuss the issue of sanctions. And we also must probe the reported contact between President Trump’s campaign staff and Russian intelligence.   The American people deserve to know the full extent of the President and his team’s ties to Russia—including possible financial ties, which is why he must immediately release his tax returns.

I asked them that simple but important question because further consolidation in the telecommunications and media industries should only be permitted if it results in better and more affordable TV, internet, and phone service for Minnesotans and people across our nation. But all too often the opposite happens and consumers pay the price. That’s why it was particularly troubling when AT&T and Time Warner signaled that they were structuring their mega-merger to circumvent FCC review and avoid proving that the deal will benefit consumers and promote competition.   And so I got some of my colleagues together and asked the companies to publicly demonstrate that the deal is in the interest of all of you—the workers and families who have to find ways to pay for higher and higher cable, phone, and internet bills each year and who deserve access to a wide-range of affordable programming.   Here's AT&T and Time Warner's response. While I'm glad they responded to me, their letter does little to address my concerns and essentially asks American consumers to trust that the combined company won’t engage in anticompetitive behavior, raise prices, violate the principles of net neutrality, or decrease access to diverse voices. But we’ve seen some of these behaviors before—both as a result of past mega-mergers and straight from AT&T itself.

Or the millions of women in Minnesota and across the country who had to pay more than men for insurance pre-ACA—simply because they are women.   These people understand how complex health care is, because they’ve experienced it firsthand when caring for themselves and their families. They don’t want to put their health in the hands of President Trump, who doesn’t understand the first thing about health care policy or how it affects people. And they certainly don’t want to leave it up to Congressional Republicans, who talked big for six years and are now coming to the table empty handed.   Let’s not rip away people’s coverage. Let’s build on the ACA by stabilizing the insurance market, reducing drug prices, and ensuring that nobody who needs health care—like the millions of Minnesotans who have a pre-existing condition—can be denied insurance coverage.  http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/27/politics/trump-health-care-complicated/","link","http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/27/politics/trump-health-care-complicated/","cnn.com",22123,3030,10882,706,1863,726,623,4110

Because he had, in fact, met at least twice with the Russian ambassador during 2016.  And then in June, the Attorney General made the excuse that my question confused him.   “There is the assertion that I did not answer Senator Franken's question honestly at my confirmation hearing. That is false. This is how it happened. He asked me a rambling question that included dramatic, new allegations…I wanted to refute immediately any suggestion that I was a part of such an activity.”    I said this last month, but it bears repeating: I don’t buy that excuse. If he really wants to clear things up, our Attorney General should come back before the Senate Judiciary Committee to give us those simple—maybe even honest, this time—answers.   But look, here’s the bottom line. Nobody in Trump world, including the President himself, his own son, his top political advisors, and the Attorney General, seem to be the least bit concerned that a hostile foreign power—Russia—sought to undermine our democracy by meddling in the 2016 presidential election.   Time and time again, these folks are acting like a group of people with something to hide, and I believe the American people deserve to know why.  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/us/politics/trump-interview-transcript.html","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/us/politics/trump-interview-transcript.html","nytimes.com",10387,1115,1877,289,116,698,196,1583

And while I’m fighting to stop that bill from hurting millions of Americans, I’m also working with my fellow Democrats on proactive, concrete policies to improve lives.    When I travel around Minnesota, I talk all the time with families who feel like the system isn’t working for them. They see the biggest corporations and richest few people continue to make massive amounts of money, but for those in the middle class, aspiring to join the middle class, or struggling to grow a small business, nothing seems to change—no matter how hard you work or how many hours you put in. I believe the economy needs to work better for all Minnesotans, not just for those at the very top.    And that’s why I’ve just helped unveil a bold new economic agenda for our country.    The “Better Deal” plan has three main pillars:   • It raises pay and creates good-paying jobs by investing in infrastructure, boosting wages, supporting retirement benefits, and cracking down on the foreign trade cheats that steal our jobs.    • It brings down monthly expenses by cutting childcare costs, addressing phone and cable bills, and lowering prescription drug prices.    • It invests in the American worker and the American community with job-skills training and support to deploy high-speed internet all across the country.    If we really want to unrig the system and usher in a new era of prosperity for the middle-class, this is the kind of economic agenda we need to pursue. These policies, many of which I’ve championed for years, confront real issues that our workers and families are facing, rather than simply benefiting the bottom lines of millionaires, billionaires, and corporate special interests.   This is exactly what the people of Minnesota sent me here to do.","status",NA,NA,9439,729,1112,1035,23,48,141,636

Do they support the so-called “Cruz Amendment,” which would bring back junk insurance plans that offer no protection and drive up out-of-pocket costs for vital services?  Or do will they rally behind their backup option—a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with nothing. Let me repeat: nothing. An approach that would add 32 million more people to the ranks of the uninsured and cause average premiums in the non-group market to double.   Or will it be something else entirely? We don’t know.

Donald Trump is right about one thing—actions do speak louder than words. And our President’s latest actions are a full-on assault on the LGBT community.   This morning, in a series of tweets, President Trump said he would reverse course on an Obama-era decision and no longer accept or allow transgender Americans to serve in the military in any capacity. There’s no courage or leadership behind that decision.   I believe that if you want to serve our country and protect our freedoms, then you should be able to do so without having to hide who you are or who you love. President Trump called these Americans a burden on and disruption to our military. I disagree. They are heroes.   Disturbingly, this may be the tip of the iceberg. Based on press reports, Trump’s Justice Department is now preparing a legal filing to completely undercut much of the progress we’ve made to protect the LGBT community from discrimination under existing federal laws—a major attack that could end up enabling discrimination against LGBT Americans in workplaces and schools across the country.

Despite the rain, I was able to tour the operation near Coates and hear firsthand the unique needs and challenges farmers want to see addressed in the upcoming Farm Bill. I later had the chance to visit local farm vendors to talk about how federal farm and nutrition programs impact them, and I couldn’t leave the farmers market in South Saint Paul without some Minnesota sweet corn.

I understand how important DACA is—these young people are American in every way except for their immigration status. They care deeply about this country, work hard, and are doing all they can to build a good life in America. We’ve already invested in them through education, and it makes no sense to squander their talents by deporting them to countries they don't even remember—by doing that, we risk losing small business owners and entrepreneurs, teachers, innovators, and community leaders.   I’m opposed to a recent effort by other states to eliminate DACA, and just last month, I pressed President Trump to preserve the program. Earlier this year, the president signaled that he would keep DACA in place, and I want to hold him to his word. I’m fighting to safeguard this important program from attacks because DACA is emblematic of what our country stands for.

He said, ""The new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions—African slavery as it exists among us—the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution.""  And he continued: ""... the great truth [is] that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.""  The Civil War and the Confederacy were about slavery. Period. I was reminded of this speech when Mitch Landrieu, the mayor of New Orleans, used it earlier this summer in powerful remarks he used to make the case for removing those monuments in his own city.   Statues erected to memorialize Confederate leaders in the Civil War—men like Robert E. Lee—suggest that this part of our history is something worth celebrating. It is not.   The people who descended on Charlottesville were there to protest the moving of a Robert E. Lee statue and assert their belief in white supremacy. The hatred and bigotry on display from these white supremacists and neo-Nazis are so universally repugnant that Republicans and Democrats on every part of the political spectrum swiftly and sharply condemned it.   But Donald Trump didn't.   The fact that white supremacists and leaders in the KKK have roundly praised what the president said in his press conference today says something pretty horrifying. Donald Trump is unwilling to condemn people who are wistful for the days of slavery—America's original sin—and who came to Virginia armed with makeshift shields and clubs.   I sincerely hope that in the wake of the failure of this president to assert any moral leadership, Americans from every corner of this country will come together to say that these people and this mindset are morally repugnant.

I stopped by the Virginia Fire Department to thank firefighters for their service and to learn more about how I can continue supporting their work, and I also met with officials and local leaders at a community action agency to hear their concerns regarding how President Trump’s budget would affect the various programs they provide for things like housing and heating assistance, Meals on Wheels, and Head Start. That same day, I toured Iron Range Makerspace and learned how entrepreneurs are working to grow the Iron Range economy at the business innovation center in Hibbing.  Yesterday, I took part in “Coffee with Congress” with about one hundred Minnesotans in Duluth where I had the opportunity to answer a lot of questions on a range of topics like the upcoming budget and tax reform debates and health care.

The women and men who sit on our federal courts wield enormous power over our daily lives, so it’s important to understand whether a nominee’s view of the law will make real our Constitution’s promise of justice and equality for all Americans, or will unfairly favor powerful interests over working families.   When President Trump announced the nomination of Minnesota Supreme Court Justice David Stras to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, I said that Justice Stras is a committed public servant whose tenure as a professor at the University of Minnesota underscores just how much he cares about the law. That is undeniably true. But as I have familiarized myself with Justice Stras’s record—not just his past decisions, but his professional experience and past statements—I have grown concerned that, if confirmed to the federal bench, Justice Stras would be a deeply conservative jurist in the mold of Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, justices who the nominee himself has identified as role models.   Early in his career, Justice Stras worked as a law clerk for Justice Thomas, one of the Supreme Court’s most conservative members. Justice Stras has described Justice Thomas as a mentor, and at an event hosted by the conservative Federalist Society, Justice Stras talked about how the jurisprudence of Justice Scalia helped to shape his own views. He said, ‘I really grew up with a steady diet of Justice Scalia, and I’m better for it.’ Justice Scalia embraced a rigid view of the Constitution that favored powerful corporate interests, was blind to the equal dignity of LGBT people, and often refused to acknowledge the lingering animus in laws that perpetuate the racial divide. As a state court judge, Justice Stras has not often had occasion to consider cases raising these issues, but I am concerned that a nominee nurtured by such an ideology would likely seek to impose it on the litigants before him.   And as it turns out, there is good reason to be concerned about that. During the presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump proudly declared that he would ‘appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.’ And to make certain that his nominees would espouse such views, President Trump outsourced the job of identifying them to the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, deeply conservative interest groups that cast skeptical eyes on workers’ rights and civil rights. Those groups produced a list of conservative judges for then-candidate Trump to consider naming to the Supreme Court—a list that included Justice Stras.   I had hoped that, in recognition of our different views, President Trump would work with me to identify a consensus candidate—a nominee whose experience demonstrates an ability to set aside rigid beliefs in favor of finding common ground. But rather than work together to select a nominee who is a judicial moderate, the White House had already settled on Justice Stras before first approaching me, and the president nominated him despite the concerns that I expressed.   Justice Stras’s professional background and record strongly suggest that, if confirmed, he would embrace the legacy of his role models and reliably rule in favor of powerful corporate interests over working people, and that he would place a high bar before plaintiffs seeking justice at work, at school, and at the ballot box. The president should be seeking out judges who bridge the issues that divide us, but I fear that Justice Stras’s views and philosophy would lead him to reinforce those divisions and steer the already conservative Eighth Circuit even further to the right.   It is for those reasons that, after careful consideration, I have decided to oppose his nomination and not to return a blue slip to the Committee.","status",NA,NA,6692,735,560,476,12,38,218,75

They track the consumer financial information—like loans and credit card payment history—that serves as the basis for your credit score, and they store personal information ranging from social security numbers to home addresses. Yesterday, Equifax broke the news that their databases were breached in a massive cybersecurity attack, putting the sensitive information of nearly 145 million Americans at risk.   Now, first and foremost, I urge everybody to take stock of your accounts. Check up on your bank accounts regularly, sign up for a reputable credit monitoring service as soon as possible, and be extremely careful before opening emails or clicking links.   But I’m concerned about a specific remedy that Equifax is offering customers and consumers.   I’ve long fought to limit something called forced arbitration clauses—which is fine print that giant corporations bury into contracts in order to insulate themselves from liability. Mandatory, forced arbitration agreements lock you, the consumer, out of pursuing meaningful justice in the courts after you’ve been wronged. And these agreements can also prevent you from banding together with other victims in class-action lawsuits.   In the wake of this massive breach, Equifax has said that anyone who signs up for its own credit monitoring service—which is called TrustedID—must waive their rights to sue or join a class-action suit.   This is not how business should be done. When a company fails to protect its customers, they should take responsibility rather than look for ways to get off the hook. And furthermore, many caught up in this breach aren’t even paying customers—they’re everyday consumers whose information has been aggregated by Equifax for years.   I plan to ask Equifax to clarify what exactly the legal rights are for the reportedly 143 million Americans whose information was caught up in this cyberattack.

So after it became public that Equifax—the massive credit bureau that stores your private information and credit scores—fell attack to an unprecedented cyberattack, I raised immediate concern that its own credit monitoring and identify theft program, TrustedID, bound Americans to forced arbitration.   While I'm glad Equifax removed the arbitration agreement from TrustedID, I remain concerned that the company's overarching terms of service still includes a forced arbitration clause.  And that’s why I’m making good on the promise I made last week to ask Equifax to clarify what exactly the legal rights are for the approximately 143 million Americans whose information was caught up in the hack.   Today, Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto and I led a broad coalition of 20 Democratic colleagues in pressing Equifax's CEO to completely end its use of forced arbitration agreements, and on top of that, to explain whether or not his company supports a new rule from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to limit the use of forced arbitration in the financial services industry.  I look forward a quick response from Equifax, because I believe it's critical that Americans understand what's happening with their very sensitive information and what their rights are if and when that information is compromised.  https://www.franken.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=3758","link","https://www.franken.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=3758","franken.senate.gov",6048,327,809,365,3,22,5,98

The iPhone X—announced yesterday and coming to market next month—includes a new feature called “Face ID,” which will allow users to unlock the home screen or purchase apps simply by looking at their phone.   While I am encouraged by the steps that Apple states it has taken to implement the system responsibly, the addition of this new technology to the iPhone has serious privacy implications. In a letter, I asked CEO Tim Cook a series of important questions about the iPhone X’s Face ID system, including how users’ “faceprints” will be protected and safeguarded, if at any point that data will be shared or sold to marketers, and whether or not law enforcement will be able to access the Face ID database.

This effort, led by Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, is quickly gaining steam, and it’s time to raise your voices in response.   The new proposal would roll back nationwide protections for people with pre-existing conditions and make health care coverage unobtainable for many Americans. And on top of that, it would profoundly change how Medicaid works—breaking the federal government's promise to fund a program that serves as a lifeline to seniors, working families, children, and people with disabilities. But that’s not all. It scraps important consumer protections, opening the door for insurers to impose lifetime and annual limits and charge older folks more money for coverage.  This proposal not only makes it harder for states to deliver care, it actually punishes states that expanded Medicaid and have proactively enrolled people in coverage—states like Minnesota. Nationally, this proposal would cut federal funding for coverage programs by $80 billion in 2026, and by $300 billion in 2027, wreaking havoc on Minnesota’s budget and state budgets across the country.  This bill would be a disaster for Minnesotans and the American people. As a member of the Senate Health Committee, I'm going to fight this, and I call on my colleagues to continue the bipartisan work we’ve started to help bring down health insurance premiums, stabilize the individual market, and lower health care costs for all people.

This morning I said goodbye to Captain Luis Montalvan, a hero of mine, who was laid to rest in Arlington cemetery. Luis was a special guy. He served in the military for 17 years and bore the wounds—both physical and invisible—after he returned to civilian life. I met Luis, along with his service dog Tuesday, in 2009, and he shared with me all the ways that service dogs can help veterans: they can help reduce depression, ward off panic attacks, assist when their owner needs help standing back up after falling, and do lots of other things.  For veterans living with service-related injuries, these dogs can mean the difference between a decent life and a very difficult one. Luis’s story inspired the first piece of legislation I introduced, which was quickly passed into law: a bill designed to increase the number of service dogs for vets.  Luis was a good man who cared deeply about his country, and I was so proud that he had the courage to share the story of the struggles he faced. In 2011, he turned his story into a book called Until Tuesday, which chronicled his journey after returning from Iraq. It was a candid account of his life after combat, and after it came out, he travelled the country giving interviews and speeches about his experience because he wanted to help others. He wrote other books, too, including a children’s book called Tuesday Takes Me There, which is among my grandson Joe’s favorites.  Despite Tuesday’s steadying presence, Luis still struggled, just like countless other veterans—sometimes years and even decades after they come home. The VA estimates that upwards of 20 percent of veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan suffer from PTSD.  Twelve percent of Gulf War veterans and 30 percent of Vietnam Veterans have suffered PTSD during their lifetime. These men and women put themselves in harm's way in service to our country, and it is our obligation to do everything we can to help them when they come back. We must do right by them. I don't have all the answers, but I do know that we can do better.  I was honored to be with Luis’s family and friends this morning to celebrate him. And Luis, I want you to know how proud I am of you. I'm proud that you were brave enough to serve your country for 17 years, and then brave enough to share the story of the hardship you faced afterwards. I'm proud of you for giving hope to other veterans who faced the same struggles you did. And I'm so proud to have called you my friend.

We do know that last night, a man named Stephen Paddock murdered nearly 60 people and injured more than 500 others—a staggering number of casualties, especially considering that law enforcement believes that he acted alone.  The New York Times reports that video of the rampage shows 9 seconds of rapid-fire gunshots, followed by about 40 seconds of silence—presumably as he reloaded—followed by two more short periods of gunfire.  Mr. Paddock was able to kill scores of people all by himself in what appears to be a matter of minutes. He was able to do that because he had 19 guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Some news reports indicate that some of the weapons were fully automatic, though that hasn’t been confirmed.  What we do know is that he was able to fire so many bullets in that short time that the gun smoke caused the hotel’s smoke alarms to activate. It seems that’s how SWAT teams were able to locate him.  I know many of you feel frustrated that we won’t ever address gun violence. But we cannot give up. Please, continue to make your voices heard.

Often called Dreamers, these people are American in every single way except for their immigration status. Minnesota is home to more than 6,000 Dreamers.   Dreamers care deeply about this country, work hard, and are doing all they can to build a good life in America. We’ve already invested in them through education, and it makes no sense to squander their talents by deporting them to countries they don't even remember—by doing that, we risk losing small business owners and entrepreneurs, teachers, innovators, and community leaders.   When Dreamers voluntarily applied for DACA, they had to share their personal information—everything from fingerprints and retinal scans to home addresses and phone numbers. Dreamers could have declined to come forward but over eight hundred thousand Dreamers courageously took a leap of faith and put their trust in our government.   Now that the President has decided to end DACA, many Dreamers are understandably worried about how the government will use the personal information that they voluntarily turned over in order to participate in the program. They’re worried that the Trump Administration will use their information to track down, arrest, and deport them.   That’s why at today’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, I told the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that if the government were to use Dreamers’ personal information against them, it would represent a shocking betrayal of the trust that Dreamers put in the government. Furthermore, I pressed DHS to clarify under what circumstances would DHS disclose a Dreamer’s personal information to an ICE request.    I promise that I will keep fighting to protect the Dreamers who live in Minnesota and across the country by defending DACA and fighting to pass the DREAM Act, a bill with bipartisan support that would create a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients. Dreamers are members of our families, they are our friends, they are our neighbors, and they should be here to stay.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatoralfranken/videos/1510743232344887/",NA,6094,399,798,750,6,19,203,27

Today, I’m pleased to see that CFPB has heeded my call and finalized a rule that would put protections in place to defend consumers. These safeguards include commonsense ideas like only allowing lenders to issue loans that borrowers can repay without being saddled with additional debt, and limiting practices that cause big overdraft fees.

And while there is a lot of talk about this group of Lynx players being a “dynasty” – and they are – I think there is more to the Lynx story than just being the best team in the league.    First, the Lynx beat a very good Los Angeles Sparks team, which had beaten them in last year’s finals and this year took two of the first three games in the Championship series.  So, the Lynx were forced to regroup to win the final two pressure-filled games in order to claim the title.   For Minnesota professional sports fans, the team’s success adds to the World championships won by the Twins in 1987 and 1991, and by the Minneapolis Lakers, who won the NBA title six times in the 1940s and 1950s before the team relocated to Los Angeles.    Like many Minnesotans, I lived through the Vikings four super bowl losses and watched the former Minnesota North Stars lose twice in the Stanley Cup finals.  And although I thought each of those teams were worthy of winning championships, it was frustrating for a lot of Minnesotans when they came up short in the final game.   That’s what makes the Lynx success much more than a sports story for our state.  It’s about a group dedicated coaches and players who have consistently displayed a long run of excellence - at the highest level - that has eluded many of our state’s other teams.   And for a generation of Minnesota youngsters – especially young girls - who aspire to their own success, this team has served as an inspiration and as an example of achieving success through grit, perseverance, and hard work.    Importantly for our state, the team is also a force in our community. The Lynx Foundation supports breast cancer research, and the Lynx Fast Break Foundation has helped positively impact a great many Minnesota youth.  In my own experience, it was a privilege to have Head Coach Cheryl Reeve serve as a judge for my annual poetry contest, which allows Minnesota students to write about and honor the military veterans in their lives.  Despite her busy schedule, Coach Reeve took the time to read and evaluate each entry and helped us choose and honor the winners.   And this team refuses to rest on its laurels.  After collecting the championship trophy last night, Coach Reeve was asked if this team can be considered a “dynasty.”  She responded by saying, “use any word you want. Right now, we’re still working.’’  In other words, they don’t plan to stop doing the things that have helped them win, and I hope we see more success in the years to come.   While more than 14,000 very loud Minnesota fans saw the team win last night, this team and it’s string of championships has been important to our state far beyond the basketball court.  So, as I send my congratulations to the best team in WNBA history, and I thank them for taking our state along for the ride.

The Clean Power Plan was created in 2015 to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and encourage states to move towards clean energy.

Climate change isn’t just a problem with consequences that we can kick down the road — it’s already causing social and economic damage.

Throughout the country, effects of climate change have been seen through devastating forest fires and more frequent and extreme weather events.   I have three grandchildren—Joe, Jacob and Avery—and God willing, they will live through this century and into the next.

It takes a lot of courage to come forward, and we owe them our thanks.   And as we hear more and more about Mr. Weinstein, it’s important to remember that while his behavior was appalling, it’s far too common.   That’s what Gretchen Carlson addresses in a New York Times op-ed she authored. In it, she says, “When I filed my sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News’s chairman and chief executive, Roger Ailes, in July 2016, I felt alone. But after I told my story, thousands of women — police officers, teachers, oil-rig operators, sports executives, military officers, engineers, waitresses, lawyers, secretaries — told me theirs.   As I’ve listened to their experiences, I’ve realized that the disappointing responses women often face when they go public both embolden harassers and encourage victims to stay silent.”   We must do something to address this all-too-common problem. And one thing we can do—which Gretchen has become a bold advocate for—is reforming arbitration laws, which prevent people who experience workplace harassment from going to court. Instead, they are forced into arbitration, a process that heavily favors the employer, often denying them justice after they’ve been harassed at work. That’s why I’ve been working to pass the Arbitration Fairness Act—so that people in the workplace wouldn’t have to sign away their rights to have their day in court when they take a job.   This is only one part of the solution, and it’s unclear what, if any, role arbitration clauses played in Mr. Weinstein’s case. But it’s critical that we address this issue.  Gretchen Carlson ends her piece with this: “I’m hopeful that the Weinstein story will represent the start of a sea change in our society’s treatment of sexually harassed workers. By ending arbitration clauses, blacklisting and workplace cultures where abuse thrives, we can ensure that victims of harassment speak out. I encourage victims to stand up and tell their stories, which I know requires immense bravery. And I’m hopeful that we’ll see changes in our laws and our culture that will allow them to do so without being victimized yet again.” I couldn’t agree more.","link","https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/opinion/women-reporting-sexual-harassment.html?referer","mobile.nytimes.com",3958,405,557,191,7,17,246,39

I’m glad to say that the Health Committee, of which I’m a member, has announced what looks to be a very promising compromise.   The compromise includes something that I negotiated really hard for—a fix to the several-hundred-million-dollar funding gap facing MinnesotaCare, a program that provides high-quality, affordable health insurance coverage to a whole lot of working families in our state.   Let me explain what happened. The State of Minnesota has put together some really innovative bipartisan ways to bring down people’s health care costs and to expand coverage. But to get them approved, the federal government needed to give its stamp of approval. And that’s done through a “1332 waiver,” a term you probably have heard recently.    Although the Trump Administration approved our waiver, they did it in a way that also made massive cuts to MinnesotaCare. Meaning that families in every corner of our state are facing a very real risk of losing their health coverage.   When that happened, I got to work—I pressured top federal officials, raised the issue constantly with Health Committee leaders, and did everything I could do to make sure that this compromise bill reversed the MinnesotaCare cuts.

I applaud this decision. Far too often, crimes targeting LGBT people go unreported and uninvestigated.   But Attorney General Sessions’ decision to prosecute this incident doesn’t tell the whole story. Since his confirmation, DOJ has wasted no time in systematically undermining attempts to safeguard LGBT people from discrimination and unequal treatment by revoking policies designed to protect them and declining to defend their rights in court.   We cannot accept this administration’s willingness to undercut the progress we’ve made to protect LGBT people from discrimination in school, at work, and in the public sphere. At last week’s Senate Judiciary hearing, I asked Sessions how he reconciles his decision to prosecute an anti-transgender hate crime with aggressively pursuing an agenda that gives cover to discrimination and hate. I don’t believe he can.   The Washington Post Editorial Board recently wrote that the DOJ must do more to protect LGBT people. They write that “defending transgender people, often the most vulnerable among us, means much more than bringing charges against those who attack them. It also requires shielding them from harassment at work and school and protecting them from situations — such as being forced to use bathrooms that don’t align with their gender identity — that can lead to violence.

In fact, the New York Times recently said that that these days, paying for college has “left us with a process of inordinate complexity.”   That’s why I’ve long worked with Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa to give our students clarity during the college search and application process. We have three bipartisan bills to help students and families better understand their college costs. Our bills would require schools to give students and their families a better idea of their financial aid options, and a better estimate of what they will need to earn, borrow, or save to attend and complete the best school for them.   These bipartisan bills provide commonsense solutions to a very real problem faced by many Minnesotans and Americans across the country. I will fight to get them passed and will keep working to find areas of agreement with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.","link","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/your-money/paying-for-college/college-costs-grassley-franken.html?smid=fb-share","nytimes.com",1570,227,147,66,2,16,63,15

I believe all Americans have the right to pursue justice in a public court of law when they’ve been wronged, but unfortunately, by locking you into unfair contracts, big companies have effectively blocked off the courtroom doors.     I find it deeply troubling that banks, financial institutions, and deep-pocketed special interests are pulling together their massive resources in order to scrap the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s “forced arbitration” rule, which is an important new safeguard that restores the ability of Americans to band together to hold corporations accountable. The rule gives consumers the power to take on the big guys, and it’s critical that we prevent it from being unraveled.   We can’t let Wall Street get away with this one.

He was locked in a bitter re-election battle, and despite being in a grueling fight for his political life, the first thing he said to me was, “How’s your mom?” As it happened, I had just come from the nursing home in Minneapolis, where Mom wasn’t doing well. I told Paul that her sporadic dementia had made it impossible to even have a conversation with her that day. He nodded, put his hand on my shoulder and said, “You know, touch means so much.”  That was Paul.  The next day, I returned to the nursing home and as I sat quietly with mom, I put my arm around her. I’m not sure if it meant anything to her, but it meant a lot to me.  Paul’s life and his work meant a lot to me too. His example as a tireless, passionate champion for working families, for veterans, for farmers, and for those who simply needed a voice has inspired my own time in the Senate. And each day I serve, I remember Paul’s words: “Politics is not about power. Politics is not about money. Politics is not about winning for the sake of winning. Politics is about the improvement of people’s lives.”  Minnesotans hold a deep respect of Paul. They leave notes and mementos for him at the quiet memorial site honoring him just off of Highway 53 near Eveleth, Minnesota. They leave them for his wife Sheila too, and for the six others—Paul and Sheila’s daughter Marcia Markuson, campaign staffers Tom Lapic, Mary McEvoy, and Will McLaughlin, and pilots Richard Conry and Michael Guess—who died with them 15 years ago today when their plane crashed just miles from the Eveleth-Virginia Airport.  I’ve been to the memorial site, and I’ve seen how deeply and personally Paul touched people in Minnesota and across the country. He inspired them not only as a Senator for 12 years, but also as a Carleton College professor who encouraged a generation of students to take action in their communities. He did so as a fiery organizer who stood up for Minnesota’s farmers and working families, insisting on giving them a voice and a seat at the table. He never lost the tenacious spirit that led him to be a collegiate wrestling champion, and he brought that same approach to standing up for Minnesotans.   I miss Paul. He was a mentor and a hero to me. And while he isn’t here with us today, his legacy lives on in so many ways. It lives on in the generation of students and activists he trained and inspired in Minnesota.  It lives on in the policies he fought for here in the Senate – for access to mental health care, for a cleaner environment, and making sure working families get a fair shot. And it lives on in the countless lives he touched – like mine, and my mom’s. I’m proud to serve in his seat in the Senate. And I’m proud to be part of carrying of his legacy.  http://www.virginiamn.com/news/local/years-after-iron-range-plane-crash-wellstone-s-legacy-still/article_b8b29dde-b939-11e7-a6ef-3f0096e9d670.html","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatoralfranken/videos/1531065836979293/",NA,16406,1270,3080,5491,2,44,1213,11

Eyow came to the United States as a refugee after Somalia’s government collapse in the 1990s and built a life in Minnesota with his wife and three children.   Violence like the attack that took Eyow should have no place in our world.

Period.   But it seems that some of my Republican colleagues don’t agree. That’s why yesterday I took to the Senate floor to demand action on the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), as well as two other vital safety net programs—Community Health Centers and National Health Service Corps. Funding for these cornerstone programs, which provide essential health services to hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans and millions more around the country, expired weeks ago.    These programs have historically secured strong bipartisan support but currently the Republican majority will not move these bills forward because they can’t agree on how to pay for them.   Yet, Senate Republicans recently endorsed a budget to increase the debt up to $1.5 trillion over ten years for tax cuts that will almost entirely benefit only the wealthiest Americans.   This is irresponsible.   If we don’t fund CHIP, our state will need to decide whether to incur significant financial losses in order to provide coverage for 125,000 children and 1,700 pregnant women.   Furthermore, the 70 Community Health Center clinics across Minnesota receiving a total of $27 million in funding to care for the uninsured and underinsured will face serious losses. And, the National Health Service Corps, a program that provides financial support and loan repayment for new clinicians in underserved areas, won’t be able to recruit staff.   This will have devastating impacts on our safety net providers and communities across Minnesota. I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take action and do what should have been happening all along—working together to pass this legislation so that we don’t let children, families and clinics down.

That kind of bipartisan problem-solving may seem unlikely, but Former Minnesota Republican Senator David Durenberger and I both believe it’s possible because we have seen it happen firsthand.   Senator Durenberger served as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee’s subcommittee on health care policy and I serve as a member of the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee today. While we have both disagreed with colleagues of the opposing party about the best ways to improve health care, we have both found that real progress is only possible when both sides are more interested in actually solving problems than they are in scoring political points.  Unfortunately, that hasn’t always been the case in recent years. Ever since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, we’ve seen Republicans refuse to work with Democrats to improve the law.  Enough is enough. The Affordable Care Act — an imperfect piece of legislation that has nevertheless extended the peace of mind that comes with health insurance to millions of families and strengthened protections for tens of millions more — is the law of the land.  It’s time for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to set politics aside and work together to lower the cost and improve the quality of health care for every American family.  Sen.

Minnesota’s open enrollment period lasts from November 1 to January 14, and I urge everybody who needs coverage to sign up sooner rather than later, because I know how busy the holiday season gets.   In 2016, our state reached a new record low of Minnesotans without health coverage, only 4.1 percent. That’s half of what our uninsured rate was in 2013.

We need to find out why.   Earlier this week, court documents revealed that at a Trump campaign national security team meeting in March 2016, foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos shared that he had been in communication with agents of Russia, even bringing up the possibility of setting up a meeting between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. This is deeply troubling for many reasons, especially because President Trump was present.   But I’d like to focus on the fact that Attorney General Jeff Sessions was also in that meeting. In fact, he was the chairman of the group that convened that day. Yet this January, he testified under oath that he was unaware of any contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. That later turned out not to be true—Attorney General Sessions himself met with the Russian Ambassador at least three times.   And now it appears that there may be evidence that Mr. Sessions subsequently failed to tell the truth when he returned to the Judiciary Committee a few weeks ago and doubled down on his assertion about the Trump team’s interactions with Russians.   Russia is a hostile foreign power that interfered in the 2016 election. That’s a fact. And now, if we want to prevent that interference from happening again, it’s imperative to get to the bottom of exactly what happened between Russia and the Trump campaign.   The American people deserve an accurate and complete accounting of the facts. That’s why I’ve sent the Attorney General a letter pressing him for the truth about what he knows about any effort on the part of Russia to influence the 2016 campaign, including any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and Russian operatives.     I sincerely hope that we get answers.

While the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress are touting some of the provisions aimed at the middle class, I fear that those will be used as a smoke-screen for a return to trickle-down tax policies that greatly benefit only a few at the top and provide very little long-term benefits for the vast majority of Americans.

And I need you to help get the word out.   Republicans slipped a provision into their tax reform bill  on Tuesday night that would eliminate one of the tenets of the ACA. If Republicans succeed in passing this bill,  13 million fewer Americans would have coverage, and millions more would see their premiums go up.   Look, I’m all for tax reform that would make the tax code simpler and fairer for everyone, but the Republican tax plan would be bad news for Minnesota—and for the country.   Their plan would overwhelmingly benefit large corporations and the wealthiest Americans, who would see huge tax cuts. Little or no benefit would go to the middle class. In fact, millions of middle-class families would see their taxes increase.   And it would ultimately force our country to slash investments in things like education, housing, infrastructure, and health care—things that matter to Minnesota families and support job creation and an expanding economy. And it would force taxpayers to foot the bill by adding $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit.   And Republicans might have the votes to pass it.   I’m going to fight this harmful tax plan with everything I’ve got, and I hope you’ll join me. It was the millions of Americans, including many of you, who made their voices heard that killed Trumpcare earlier this year. Let’s do it again.     Thanks for listening. Now help sound the alarm.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatoralfranken/videos/1552377278181482/",NA,21466,4338,24640,1527,149,452,552,4463

There's more I want to say, but the first and most important thing—and if it's the only thing you care to hear, that's fine—is: I'm sorry.   I respect women.  I don't respect men who don't.  And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed.   But I want to say something else, too.  Over the last few months, all of us—including and especially men who respect women—have been forced to take a good, hard look at our own actions and think (perhaps, shamefully, for the first time) about how those actions have affected women.   For instance, that picture.  I don't know what was in my head when I took that picture, and it doesn't matter. There's no excuse. I look at it now and I feel disgusted with myself. It isn't funny. It's completely inappropriate. It's obvious how Leeann would feel violated by that picture. And, what's more, I can see how millions of other women would feel violated by it—women who have had similar experiences in their own lives, women who fear having those experiences, women who look up to me, women who have counted on me.   Coming from the world of comedy, I've told and written a lot of jokes that I once thought were funny but later came to realize were just plain offensive.  But the intentions behind my actions aren't the point at all.  It's the impact these jokes had on others that matters.  And I'm sorry it's taken me so long to come to terms with that.   While I don't remember the rehearsal for the skit as Leeann does, I understand why we need to listen to and believe women’s experiences.   I am asking that an ethics investigation be undertaken, and I will gladly cooperate.   And the truth is, what people think of me in light of this is far less important than what people think of women who continue to come forward to tell their stories. They deserve to be heard, and believed. And they deserve to know that I am their ally and supporter. I have let them down and am committed to making it up to them.","status",NA,NA,68548,24302,14994,11889,472,453,6085,1008

There is so much to fight for, and on Monday in the Senate Education Committee I highlighted the need to fix the country’s student debt crisis. I’ve long made it a top priority to address college affordability and plan to keep fighting for our students and families.   Then on Tuesday, I pressed the nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services on how he would bring down prescription drug prices—a huge cost for far too many families in Minnesota and across the country.    And just yesterday, I joined the conversation on the opioid crisis, which has taken hold in every corner of our state. At a Health Committee hearing, I shared what I’ve heard from Minnesota communities that are successfully fighting back against the epidemic—for example, we need to improve economic opportunities in both rural areas and the cities, increase investments in prevention, monitoring, treatment, and recovery, and ultimately, help folks who are struggling find real paths out of poverty.    I know, as well, that a lot of you are worried about this bad tax bill that the Republicans are trying to pass into law. I support smart, commonsense tax reform that would make the tax code simpler and fairer for Minnesota families. But that’s not this GOP tax plan. This bill would overwhelmingly benefit large corporations and the wealthiest Americans, who will see huge tax cuts, with little or no benefit going to the middle class. In fact, millions of American middle-class families will see their taxes go up.

Since the internet was created, net neutrality has been the reason why giant corporations can’t pick, choose, block, or charge you extra for the websites you visit.   But all of that—the fundamentals of the internet as we know it—is at serious risk.   A couple years back, you—the American consumer—spoke out with an important demand: keep the internet open. Because of your efforts, we were able to enact nationwide net neutrality rules to do just that.   Since then, big companies and corporate special interests have been fighting back to scrap those rules. And they are dangerously close to succeeding.   President Trump’s FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has decided to go full steam ahead with a December 14 vote on a policy that would destroy net neutrality—and he’s doing that despite an alarming new report that computer bots may have influenced the public comment period on this terrible policy by filing hundreds of thousands of fraudulent comments.   At a minimum, this vote should be delayed until there’s a review into how bots influenced the net neutrality debate. I pressed Chairman Pai to do that earlier today.   But I would actually go even further. My message to Chairman Pai is simple: leave the internet alone. End your campaign to fundamentally alter the internet as we know it.   Protect net neutrality.  https://www.franken.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=3806","link","https://www.franken.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=3806","franken.senate.gov",17302,3941,1634,1483,38,41,68,287

We were finally beginning to listen to women about the ways in which men’s actions affect them.  That moment was long overdue. I was excited for that conversation, and hopeful that it would result in real change that made life better for women all across the country and in every part of our society.   Then, the conversation turned to me. Over the last few weeks, a number of women have come forward to talk about how they felt my actions had affected them. I was shocked. I was upset. But in responding to their claims, I also wanted to be respectful of that broader conversation, because all women deserve to be heard, and their experiences taken seriously.    I think that was the right thing to do. I also think it gave some people the false impression that I was admitting to doing things that, in fact, I haven’t done. Some of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others, I remember very differently.   I said at the outset that the Ethics Committee was the right venue for these allegations to be heard, and investigated, and evaluated on their merits. That I was prepared to cooperate fully. And that I was confident in the outcome.   You know, an important part of the conversation we’ve been having the last few months has been about how men abuse their power and privilege to hurt women.    I am proud that, during my time in the Senate, I have used my power to be a champion for women – and that I have earned a reputation as someone who respects the women I work alongside every day. I know there’s been a very different picture of me painted over the last few weeks. But I know who I really am.    Serving in the United States Senate has been the great honor of my life. I know in my heart that nothing I have done as a Senator – nothing – has brought dishonor on this institution. And I am confident that the Ethics Committee would agree.   Nevertheless, today I am announcing that, in the coming weeks, I will be resigning as a member of the United States Senate.   I, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party.   But this decision is not about me. It’s about the people of Minnesota. And it’s become clear that I can’t both pursue the Ethics Committee process and, at the same time, remain an effective Senator for them.   Let me be clear. I may be resigning my seat, but I am not giving up my voice. I will continue to stand up for the things I believe in as a citizen, and as an activist.   But Minnesotans deserve a Senator who can focus with all her energy on addressing the challenges they face every day.   There is a big part of me that will always regret having to walk away from this job with so much work left to be done. But I have faith that the work will continue, because I have faith in the people who have helped me do it.   I have faith in the dedicated, funny, selfless young men and women on my staff. They have so much more to contribute to our country. And I hope that, as disappointed as they may feel today, everyone who has ever worked for me knows how much I admire and respect them.   I have faith in my colleagues, especially my senior Senator, Amy Klobuchar. I would not have been able to do this job without her guidance and wisdom. And I have faith – or, at least, hope – that members of this Senate will find the political courage necessary to keep asking the tough questions, hold this administration accountable, and stand up for the truth.   I have faith in the activists who organized to help me win my first campaign and who have kept on organizing to help fight for the people who needed us: kids facing bullying, seniors worried about the price of prescription drugs, Native Americans who have been overlooked for far too long, working people who have been taking it on the chin for a generation – everyone in the middle class and everyone aspiring to join it.    I have faith in the proud legacy of progressive advocacy that I have had the privilege to be a part of. I think I’ve probably repeated these words ten thousand times over the years, Paul Wellstone’s famous quote: “The future belongs to those who are passionate and work hard.” It is still true. It will always be true.   And, most of all, I have faith in Minnesota. A big part of this job is going around the state and listening to what people need from Washington. But, more often than not, when I’m home, I’m blown away by how much Minnesota has to offer the entire country and the entire world. The people I have had the honor of representing are brilliant, and creative, and hard-working. And whoever holds this seat next will inherit the challenge I’ve enjoyed for the last eight and a half years: being as good as the people you serve.   This has been a tough few weeks for me. But I am a very, very lucky man. I have a beautiful, healthy family that I love, and that loves me very much. I am going to be just fine.   I’d just like to end with one last thing.   I did not grow up wanting to be a politician. I came to this relatively late in life. I had to learn a lot on the fly. It wasn’t easy. And it wasn’t always fun.   I’m not just talking about today. This is a hard thing to do with your life. There are a lot of long hours and late nights and hard lessons, and there is no guarantee that all your work and sacrifice will ever pay off. I won my first election by 312 votes – it could have easily gone the other way. And even when you win, progress is far from inevitable. Paul Wellstone spent his whole life working for mental health parity, and it didn’t pass into law until six years after he died.   This year, a lot of people who didn’t grow up imagining they’d ever get involved in politics have done just that. They’ve gone to their first protest march, or made their first call to a member of Congress, or maybe even taken the leap and put their name on a ballot for the first time.    It can be such a rush, to look around at a room full of people ready to fight alongside you, to feel that energy, to imagine that better things are possible. But you, too, will experience setbacks and defeats and disappointments.  There will be days when you will wonder whether it’s worth it.    What I want you to know is that, even today, even on the worst day of my political life, I feel like it’s all been worth it. “Politics,” Paul Wellstone told us, “is about the improvement of people’s lives.” I know that the work I’ve been able to do has improved people’s lives. I would do it all over again in a heartbeat.   For a decade now, every time I would get tired, or discouraged, or frustrated, I would think about the people I was doing this for, and it would get me back up on my feet. I know the same will be true for everyone who decides to pursue a politics that is about improving people’s lives. And I hope you know that I will be right there fighting alongside you, every step of the way.   With that, M. President, I yield the floor.","video","https://www.facebook.com/senatoralfranken/videos/1577273085691901/",NA,18387,19446,11998,6124,407,306,29282,596

I strongly support a recently issued rule from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—or CFPB, for short—to help protect Americans' constitutional rights when they sign up for credit cards, checking accounts, or take out a payday alone, for example. Giant financial institutions and the big Wall Street banks hate this rule, because it means they won’t be able keep as many Americans locked out of the courts, and now they’re wielding their influence and power to get Congress to kill it. In fact, there was already a vote in the House of Representatives that took the first step towards dismantling the CFPB arbitration rule.  If we don’t push back, Wall Street could get its way.

And if answering questions of exactly how that money will be spent, executives have a legal responsibility to be truthful.
