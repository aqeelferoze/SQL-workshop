The widespread pain of Obamacare’s higher costs and broken promises is already being felt by countless families and workers, yet with the law’s looming Cadillac Tax, in many ways the worst is yet to come.  The Cadillac Tax is a major reason why the so-called Affordable Care Act will make health care even less affordable and accessible for so many households across America. Sensible health care policy should encourage employers to offer a full range of health plans to their associates, not punish them with an unfair tax for doing so. The sad result will be higher deductibles and fewer services for hardworking Americans. With most Pennsylvanians covered by employer-sponsored health insurance, this Obamacare tax will be a disaster felt especially close to home.  As our next Vice President Mike Pence reminded me and my colleagues this morning, we have a duty to fulfill our promise to the millions of Americans who are awaiting and demanding relief from Obamacare. As the new Congress and incoming administration begin the process of achieving real health care reform that actually lowers costs and is patient-centered, both Republicans and Democrats agree that this onerous tax should be repealed immediately. Doing so would mark a promising and productive start to the new year.

I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee to keep our promise to the American people and chart a better way for our country’s health care system.  From the very beginning, Obamacare was a legislative disaster built on dishonesty, deception, and devastating partisanship. It represented precisely how health care reform — or any major government initiative — should never be done. The stories from families and workers in Western Pennsylvania and elsewhere who’ve been hurt by Obamacare’s higher costs and broken promises have been heartbreaking to hear, but have nevertheless steeled my commitment to resolving this law’s consequences, no matter how challenging it may be.

The energy and enthusiasm I felt firsthand on the campaign trail last year with our new president is being relived today as we witness the peaceful transfer of power that is a hallmark of our democracy. Donald Trump is taking office with wind at his back and an unmistakable mandate to put everyday hardworking Americans first again. I offer my sincerest congratulations to both the Trump and Pence families as they begin this historic journey and will pray for their success and well-being every day.  Abraham Lincoln once said, ""If you want to test a man’s character, give him power."" To my deepest regret, President Obama used his executive power to divide Americans and denigrate the legislative process in pursuit of an aggressively partisan agenda—all despite campaigning on an inspirational promise to do the very opposite. I am confident that President Trump has learned the lessons of his predecessor and will govern in a spirit of national unity, faithful to our Constitution and guided by an unapologetic belief in American exceptionalism.  With a unified Republican government now leading America forward, the opportunities at hand are tremendous, as are the responsibilities. I commend President Trump’s desire to get to work right away in order to correct our country’s course, at home and in many arenas abroad. As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, where health care and tax reform remain our shared priorities, I look forward to working with him toward a future with lower, simpler taxes and more affordable and accessible health care insurance that is choice-filled and patient-centered.

As a lawmaker, my most important duty is guaranteeing the safety of American citizens, especially against a deadly enemy that seeks to exploit our country’s generosity. I believe that President Trump and Vice President Pence share this sacred commitment.  The United States should continue to be the world’s most charitable and compassionate nation. At the very same time, we have to be realistic about the manipulative nature of terrorist groups like ISIS, who have a sickening history of infiltrating refugee populations in order to carry out attacks on their host countries. For a long time, we have needed a stronger, stricter verification system for refugees entering our country in order to fully protect Americans from the enemy’s evolving techniques.  I am very much aware of the passionate response to President Trump’s executive order by many Americans. My primary focus is making sure the order improves our refugee program in a way that both strengthens our national security and upholds our values. I respectfully but strongly disagree with the criticism that this order is discriminatory against any group of people other than actual terrorists. I would not support a law or policy that undermines our Founding principles of liberty and justice for all.  I am particularly pleased that the president’s order allows for exceptions for those who are proven allies and have helped America on the battlefield. I am also glad that the Trump administration has clarified that current green card holders from countries referenced in the order will not be prevented from returning to the United States. I believe our federal government can and should be compassionate toward innocent people fleeing from oppression overseas while simultaneously fulfilling its constitutional obligation to keep Americans safe.

This bill will improve efforts to identify and track childhood cancer incidences, improve the quality of life for childhood cancer survivors, and identify opportunities to expand the research of therapeutics necessary to treat the approximately 15,700 kids diagnosed with cancer in America every year.  No parent should ever have to hear the words, ""Your child has cancer."" I am so grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for coming together to introduce this crucial legislation to help make that dream a reality. The STAR Act will be a powerful tool in the fight to eradicate childhood cancer forever, and an ally to the survivors who have bravely fought and beat this horrible disease.

He fought valiantly in World War II, during which he was captured, endured the Bataan Death March, and, as a prisoner of war for three and a half years, was beaten, stabbed, and shot, and then survived malaria and starvation until he was eventually rescued by the 6th Rangers.  As he got into his later years, in his 80s and his 90s, he would go to Butler’s VA center every single day to help fellow veterans. His sole purpose in life was to help other American citizens, to help other veterans, to bring a little light into their life. Overall he spent 40 thousand hours of service in that VA center! He could’ve spent his time doing other things, but he didn’t. He chose to stay with those he loved. He chose to serve those he loved. He chose to continue to serve, even in his retirement, this nation that he loved so much.   I cannot tell you how much it means to be able to look at the new health center going up and knowing that Mr. Abraham, from his new post in Heaven, is looking down and is so thankful to a grateful nation that we are taking time to take care of those who’ve given everything they can to make sure our nation remains free.  Mr. Abraham is the epitome of the values of our country, our military, and our veterans, and a great inspiration to all Americans. It is truly fitting that Butler's new health care center be named after him.

Keith Rothfus and Bill Shuster. We describe why Congress has an urgent mandate to relieve families and workers from this failed law's broken promises, and how we're working to produce a patient-centered alternative that guarantees choice, flexibility, and real affordability for all.  Just recently, I received a heart-breaking letter from a self-employed father of four in Edinboro currently ""feeling the hurtful effects of Obamacare."" His premiums went up again this year and he was forced to reduce his family's coverage from a silver plan to a bronze plan with a nearly $7,000 deductible. He sadly writes: ""I'm paying yet more money for less coverage. ... My kids are still hungry after dinner. We desperately need relief, and now.""  It’s time for a serious change. We have no choice but to scrap this failed program and replace it with a plan that gives Pennsylvanians access to the care they need, at a price they can afford, and from a doctor they choose.

It is called ""the American Health Care Act.""  I invite you to read the full text of the bill here: https://housegop.leadpages.co/healthcare/   The facts are clear: Obamacare is a failed law. Its higher costs and broken promises are actively hurting countless families and workers throughout Western Pennsylvania and across America. My colleagues and I in Congress have promised to provide Americans relief, and that is what we are doing. Those getting hurt by Obamacare should have hope, and those worried about losing their coverage should take comfort that we will not repeat the mistakes of Obamacare's disastrous creation.  Overall, the American Health Care Act is comprised of two components: one by the Ways and Means Committee (on which I sit), and another by the Energy and Commerce Committee. Specifically, the Ways and Means component of the bill:  - Dismantles Obamacare's taxes and mandates—including the individual and employer mandate penalties and taxes on prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, health insurance premiums, and medical devices;  - Empowers individuals and families to spend their health care dollars the way they want and need by enhancing and expanding Health Savings Accounts (HSAs);  - Helps Americans access affordable, quality health care by providing a monthly tax credit to individuals and families who don't receive insurance through work or a government program;  - Protects those with pre-existing conditions from being denied coverage, and those under 26 from being taken off their parents' health insurance plan.  This week, the Ways and Means Committee will take the first step in approving this bill and thereby bringing it closer to a full vote on the House floor. We will work as long as it takes to responsibly repeal and replace Obamacare until cost-lowering, patient-centered health care reform for all Americans is finally achieved. Most importantly, we will carry out this process with the full honesty and transparency that you deserve.","link","https://housegop.leadpages.co/healthcare/","housegop.leadpages.co",64,95,31,8,0,2,0,26

The reckless war on coal carried out by the last administration is now over. No longer will a rigid ideology be put ahead of our nation’s workers and prosperity. Just as President Obama kept his promise to hurt coal and those who use it, President Trump is keeping his promise to put our economy first and I commend him for it.  In Pennsylvania alone, coal is responsible for roughly 40,000 jobs and 40 percent of our electric power. The Associated Press rightly calls it ""the workhorse of the US power system."" For too long the federal government has cruelly disregarded the needs of workers, families, and seniors – in Western Pennsylvania and across America – who rely on coal's benefits and have felt the pain of the EPA’s costly overreach. Those days are thankfully over.  I believe we can ensure clean air and clean water without leaving Americans jobless and our economy weaker. I agree with the White House that the best way to protect our environment is to have robust and dynamic economic growth. A safe environment and a strong economy should not be mutually exclusive. With today’s fresh start, both goals can be achieved.

Peter DeFazio (D-OR) to introduce a new bipartisan bill known as the Investing in America/Unlocking the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Act.  The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund was created by the Reagan administration to ensure that our nation’s ports and harbors, like the Port of Erie, would always be properly dredged and fully operational. Unfortunately, much of its annually collected revenue is no longer making it back to the ports where it is desperately needed. The result is the inexcusable deterioration of our ports from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast, which negatively impacts our economy in Erie and nationwide. Failing to maintain our ports and channels destroys American jobs and forces families to pay more money for the goods they need.   This commonsense, bipartisan bill will make sure that America’s ports and harbors are once again fully maintained, which will save and create jobs, grow businesses, and keep us competitive on the global stage. We will ensure that the United States is equipped with a modern and efficient transportation system to meet the needs of a 21st century economy without raising a single dime in taxes.

In three months time, he has signed more bills to repeal more job-killing regulations than any president before him to get our economy growing again; he has ensured that the Supreme Court will remain faithful to our Constitution and respect the rule of law and our founders' intentions; he has approved the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline; he has ended the EPA's war on coal; he has set the stage for pro-growth tax reform and the full repeal and replacement of Obamacare; he has powerfully restored our credibility on the world stage.  As President Trump said before the election: “We will stop apologizing for America, and we will start celebrating America.” That is a promise kept.  Where there were apologies, there is now pride. Where there was indecision, there is now resolution. Where there was moral relativism, there is once again American exceptionalism. Instead of a lecturer as president, we now have a leader.  No president’s agenda has ever or will ever be completed in 100 days or even a year. There is still much work to be done and many promises to be fulfilled. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that our trajectory of weakness has been stopped and reversed.  As President Trump visits Pennsylvania this Saturday, those of us welcoming him will celebrate the beginning of an era in which the world’s greatest republic rejected decline and instead chose to reaffirm its strength, its principles, its potential, and yes, its greatness.

Collin Peterson (D-MN) known as the Faith in Health Savings Accounts Act. It will allow members of Health Care Sharing Ministries (HCSMs) to use Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to save money on medical expenses without having to purchase a high deductible health insurance plan.  As its name suggests, this commonsense bill is based on widespread faith in HSAs as a powerfully effective tool to make health care more affordable, along with our belief that Americans who pay into HCSMs deserve access to them. This is about guaranteeing fairness, financial savings, and greater peace of mind to countless faith-based households currently being neglected by our nation’s outdated tax code.  U.S. News & World Report puts it this way:   ""In plain English, the one-sentence Kelly bill would allow millions of people of faith to save tax-free for their medical expenses. It would do this by opening up the popular Health Savings Accounts program to hundreds of thousands of Americans who have been inadvertently shut out of it because of their religious practice.""  “Health Savings Accounts and health care sharing are naturally complementary – a match made in heaven … In uniting the two concepts, Kelly has done something astonishing. He has come up with a non-partisan, non-ideological, non-controversial health care reform that would actually make the world better.”  Read more about the bill here: http://kelly.house.gov/press-release/rep-kelly-introduces-bipartisan-bill-help-more-americans-save-money-health-care  And here: https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2015/08/21/rep-mike-kelly-health-care-savings-account-bill-was-made-in-heaven?int=opinion-rec","link","http://kelly.house.gov/press-release/rep-kelly-introduces-bipartisan-bill-help-more-americans-save-money-health-care","kelly.house.gov",59,95,9,8,2,1,1,30

Repealing and replacing Obamacare has been our unmistakable mandate since it was first passed with blatant lies and deception, only to betray millions of Americans with higher costs, fewer choices, and lost coverage. Today marks the beginning of the end of this failed law’s broken promises and damage.  The American Health Care Act represents the beginning of a better health care system that is patient-centered, choice-filled, and cost-lowering. With this bill, and future action taken by Congress and the Trump administration, American families and workers will be guaranteed access to affordable, high-quality health insurance in a competitive market based on freedom and flexibility. Taxes will be cut, premium-increasing regulations will be eliminated, and power will be rightly restored to individual states, patients, and their doctors. No more one-size-fits-all federal system.  After exhaustive review, I have made sure that this bill fully protects patients with pre-existing conditions by strengthening current law and establishing new requirements for states to follow as they redesign their markets to meet their populations’ needs. I would not support this bill or any other bill if such strict protections were not included. Earlier this afternoon I also voted for a bill to guarantee that no member of Congress or our staff is exempted from the law or treated differently. As this process moves forward, my focus will continue to be on making sure health care policy defends the most vulnerable and promotes fairness for American consumers.

High-quality early learning/care is one of the most effective ways to help kids escape poverty and ensure equal opportunity for all. It leads to higher graduation and employment rates, and it helps build a more prepared workforce. Though we come from opposite sides of the political aisle, we agree that helping families afford child care or early education programs should be a bipartisan goal and is a smart investment in the future of America.  Last year, we worked together to introduce the Working Families Relief Act in the U.S. House of Representatives.

I was naturally overjoyed to hear Vice President Pence's wonderful addresses at both the Third District's own Grove City College and my own alma mater, Notre Dame. His message to the graduates was inspirational, and his tribute to America's liberties and ideals — from freedom of expression to the right to life — was timely and refreshing.   Earlier today in Saudi Arabia, President Trump delivered, and every nation heard, a powerful rallying cry for all civilized people to unite and permanently eradicate the presence of Islamist terrorism from our world.  He did not apologize or lecture but instead asserted our cause's righteousness and insisted that the populations most devastated by terrorists — majority Arab and Muslim countries — join with America like never before to win the long war against our shared enemy. In the president's own words:  ""The potential of this region has never been greater. 65 percent of its population is under the age of 30. Like all young men and women, they seek great futures to build, great national projects to join, and a place for their families to call home. But this untapped potential, this tremendous cause for optimism, is held at bay by bloodshed and terror. There can be no coexistence with this violence. There can be no tolerating it, no accepting it, no excusing it, and no ignoring it.""  Those in attendance received a message of strength, assurance, and confidence regarding the hard pursuit of a more peaceful world. President Trump rightly characterized the war on terror as ""a battle between Good and Evil."" He made it clear that America will do whatever it must to win that war, but reminded the audience that the fight is not ours alone. Again, in the president's own words:  ""We can only overcome this evil if the forces of good are united and strong – and if everyone in this room does their fair share and fulfills their part of the burden. Terrorism has spread across the world. But the path to peace begins right here, on this ancient soil, in this sacred land. America is prepared to stand with you – in pursuit of shared interests and common security. But the nations of the Middle East cannot wait for American power to crush this enemy for them. ... A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and extremists. Drive. Them. Out. DRIVE THEM OUT of your places of worship. DRIVE THEM OUT of your communities. DRIVE THEM OUT of your holy land, and DRIVE THEM OUT OF THIS EARTH.""  President Trump left absolutely no doubt of our country's resolve to leave our children and grandchildren a world where Islamic terrorists and their dark ideology are finally extinct. It was the kind of address by our Commander in Chief and the Leader of the Free World that is making America great, strong, and respected again.

The Senate version was introduced by U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), and Al Franken (D-MN).  Everyone knows that one of the leading drivers of health care costs in America is the sky-rocketing price of prescription drugs. This impacts how hardworking Americans budget their money, care for their families, and plan for their futures. When it comes to caring for the elderly, paying for the cost of medicine is often the greatest challenge. This year alone, prescription drug prices for seniors are expected to rise by nearly 10 percent. Unfortunately, more competition and lower prices are being inhibited by a backlog of thousands of generic drug applications at the FDA. A shorter wait time will bring cheaper alternatives to market quicker.  With prescription drug prices rising the way they are, the best solution is more competition, not less. It’s widely understood that pricing controls lead to harmful shortages, stifle life-saving research, and simply don’t work. Instead, this commonsense bill will foster a more competitive pharmaceutical industry where doctors and patients have access to more affordable alternatives. By creating an expedited review process for certain generic drugs where there is little existing competition, such a reform will be powerfully effective in reducing health care costs and directly benefit millions of Americans of all ages.

Early education and a child’s healthy development go hand in hand. Giving kids the right foundation at a young age means giving them a fair opportunity to succeed in life. Unfortunately, far too many working families struggle to cover costs for quality care. This bill will help parents overcome that difficulty by expanding and modernizing Dependent Care Assistance Program (DCAP) accounts, which currently help more than 1.3 million families pay for early learning programs and childcare every year. As Congress works closer toward achieving pro-growth tax reform to rebuild our economy, this bill is about making sure our tax code is firmly on the side of our nation’s most precious asset – our children – and the hardworking parents who love and support them.

We must never forget that our freedom is underwritten by the blood, bravery, and heroism of more than one million sons and daughters who selflessly fought and died so that others could live. All those who answer the call of duty, wear our nation's uniform, and give us their last full measure of devotion must not only be remembered but revered, honored, and eternally cherished in our hearts and in our minds. The lessons of their courage and the reasons for which they fought must be passed on to every generation. Our devotion to their memory must be as boundless and endless as their devotion was to us. And so it is for these reasons that we commemorate their service and sacrifices in songs, on monuments, with parades, and on days like today — when a grateful nation comes together, away from our labor, to bow our heads and lower our flags as we collectively say 'Thank You' to our mightiest heroes.  May God bless the United States of America and all those who have nobly fought — and are still fighting — to keep her safe and free!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/MikeKellyPA/photos/a.197371823630070.48099.191056827594903/1557769730923599/?type=3",NA,44,4,2,5,0,0,0,0

It is a victory for our economy, our sovereignty, and our Constitution. The Paris Agreement – which should have been considered a treaty from the very beginning – was written with Americans and their elected representatives as an afterthought. It would result in unfair domestic harm for American workers, taxpayers, consumers, manufacturers, and energy producers. We would shoulder most of the cost and gain no measurable reward. There’s a reason President Obama never submitted this accord to the Senate for proper approval: it would have been rejected as a very bad deal for America, and rightly so.  I have complete confidence in our country’s ability to protect both our economy and our environment at the same time, and I applaud President Trump’s strong commitment to this goal. Moving forward, both the executive and legislative branches must work together to ensure that every international commitment that we follow primarily serves the interests of American citizens above all else. As elected leaders, the laws and policies we craft must reflect the needs of our constituents, not the demands of a global ideological trend. As the president admirably stated, he was ""elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris."" I thank him for keeping this major promise and putting our country first.

I have known my friend Steve Scalise since first coming to Congress and have spent much of the day praying for his full recovery and that of the other innocent victims. The fact that everyone at that field was practicing for a bipartisan baseball game for charity makes this attack all the more tragic and disturbing. Thanks to the heroism of the security officers on the scene, untold lives were saved and a potential massacre was prevented. I wholeheartedly salute them, and all of the Capitol Police, for their daily professionalism and service to our nation. As we move forward as a Congress and a country, I believe it is time for all Americans to regain perspective about what our democracy should entail. Fueling our politics with the unadulterated hatred we’ve seen in recent months only serves to dehumanize our leaders, denigrate our First Amendment, and endanger our fellow citizens.

While speaking on the House floor, I called on President Trump to formally withdraw the United States from the dangerous U.N.

As President Trump made clear last night, the consequences of leaving Afghanistan defenseless against the terrorists are far too dire and deadly to ignore. We experienced what happens when radical Islamists are free to rule their own country on the morning of 9/11. We saw what happens when we leave vulnerable allies to fend for themselves after we hastily pulled out of Iraq. In order to protect Americans from terrorism and avoid having to go back to war later on, we must finish the fight at hand.   Frustration, while understandable, is no excuse for failure. Surrender in the face of this evil enemy, whether in Afghanistan or elsewhere, is not an acceptable option. As long as they crave and plot our destruction, we must stay committed to ensuring theirs. With a more focused goal and smarter strategy now in place, I believe that a lasting victory is more achievable than ever. Our troops are trained to fight and win wars, and that's what our government must let them do.   As we forge ahead, I pray for every single American warrior on the battlefield and wish them success in their noble mission — in the president's own words: ""attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing Al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge."" The peace of our country and safety of future generations is on the line.

I share President Trump’s sentiment, expressed earlier today, that children should not be punished for the actions of their parents and that “we are a nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws.” I also applaud Speaker Ryan’s commitment to upholding Congress’s role as the law-writing body within our government and his readiness to craft legislation that deals with the complex legal, security, and humanitarian aspects of immigration. Unfortunately, we are at this point because our previous president grew impatient with constitutional limits and attempted to unilaterally create new law. That fact remains: despite its best intentions, President Obama’s DACA executive order is unconstitutional. President Trump has now given Congress six months to decide on a policy that will allow the DACA order to come to a responsible end. Going forward, I will be examining all options before determining what Congress should specifically do.   As I have stated many times before, the Constitution is not a suggestion. If President Obama had sincerely wanted to create a new immigration law during his tenure, then he should have worked with the legislative branch to do so. Instead, very regrettably, he overstepped his executive authority and created the policy crisis at hand by not following the rule of law.

This crucial program ensures that women with pregnancies, planned or unplanned, can receive access to timely, accurate information about adoption.   Congress first authorized the Infant Adoption Awareness Training Program in 2000 to award grants to adoption organizations to help train designated staff to provide adoption information and referrals to pregnant women on an equal basis with all other courses of action. The program annually delivered training to an estimated 10,000 health care workers nationwide, but was unfortunately ended in 2010.  While there are approximately 2 million couples waiting to adopt in the United States, there were only 18,329 domestic infant adoptions in 2014 (the last year measured). With my amendment, as part of the The Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act of 2018 (H.R. 3354), more couples seeking children will be able to start families and more infants will be welcomed into loving homes throughout America.  (H.R. 3354 funds “Adoption Awareness Programs” at $39.1 million.

With this framework, pro-growth tax reform is no longer just a lofty ambition but a concrete plan that is closer to realization than at any point in over three decades. This is a total win for America in every measurable way. For hardworking families and individuals, this means more take-home pay. For American companies, it means no longer having to pay the world’s highest tax rate but, instead, being able to create new jobs, increase wages, and compete globally on a level playing field. For everyone, it means a much stronger American economy supported by a fairer, simpler, more understandable tax code.  This is an economic growth plan. This is a jobs plan. This is a relief plan for hardworking Americans who are tired of forfeiting too much of their hard-earned paycheck to the government. The foundation of this framework is the mandate delivered loudly by the American people last year. They are sick and tired of a government that overtaxes them and an economy that underperforms for them. I hear it everywhere I travel throughout Western Pennsylvania. They want lower taxes, bigger paychecks, and more job opportunities in their communities. This historic tax cut plan is an answer to their rightful demands.  I strongly commend President Trump for his leadership in this fight. As a fellow private sector businessman, he knows what so many Americans have long sensed: that our economy is falling behind, not because our people are working less hard – far from it – but because Washington is letting others take advantage of us. He knows we simply cannot dominate the global market by taxing our businesses more than anywhere else around the globe. This senseless assault on our own economy, on our own workers and families, will soon come to an end. By cutting and simplifying taxes for both workers and businesses, Americans will finally have more money and time back in their hands.

It is both alarming and outrageous that the United States is currently one of ***only 7 countries*** in the entire world that still allow elective abortions after 5 months.

After more than 40 public hearings under 3 different chairmen over nearly 7 years, the House Ways & Means Committee has produced the most monumental tax cut bill in a generation: The Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.  This historic legislation means more take-home pay for every single hardworking American so that he and she can keep more of their hard-earned money to spend as they choose instead of shipping it off to the federal government. It also means that American companies will no longer have to pay the highest taxes in the industrialized world. By sensibly lowering the corporate tax rate, our nation’s businesses can create more jobs, bring old jobs back, keep more jobs here, and fairly compete in the global marketplace. The process of turning this far-reaching bill into law is just beginning—there is still much work ahead. At the end of the day, our goal will be the same: more money in every taxpayers’ pocket, a stronger economy, and a tax code that makes sense again.

On the brink of this historic moment, it's worth recalling the words of President John F. Kennedy from 55 years ago:   ""It is increasingly clear that no matter what party is in power, so long as our national security needs keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenues to balance our budget — just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits. …Only full employment can balance the budget, and tax reduction can pave the way to that employment. ... This nation can afford to reduce taxes, we can afford a temporary deficit — but we cannot afford to do nothing. For on the strength of our free economy rests the hope of all free nations. We shall not fail that hope — for free men and free nations must prosper and they must prevail.”  True then, true now!

Joe Courtney (D-CT) to repeal Obamacare's unfair ""Cadillac Tax"" — a controversial provision that would impose a 40 percent excise tax on all high-value employer-provided health insurance plans.  Sensible health care policy should encourage employers to offer a full range of health plans to their associates, not punish them with an unfair tax for doing so. With most Pennsylvanians covered by employer-sponsored health insurance, this Obamacare tax will be a disaster felt especially close to home.

If law-abiding Americans have already earned a permit to carry their concealed firearms in their own home state, then there is no good reason why reciprocity shouldn’t be granted to them in another state. It’s what we do with driver’s licenses and, as a matter of personal rights and safety, it just makes good sense to do it with gun licensing as well. This bill will prevent the burden of bureaucracy from getting in the way of gun-owning citizens freely and responsibly exercising their rights as Americans.  The Second Amendment is not an abstraction or an exception. The Bill of Rights means what it says as much today as when it was written. The right to bear arms is a fundamental part of our identity as a free people and an indispensable pillar of our free society. I am proud to support the passage of this bill to reinforce our Second Amendment rights and tear down the lingering obstacles that prevent the American people from fully realizing them.","link","https://kelly.house.gov/press-release/rep-kelly-supports-concealed-carry-reciprocity-act","kelly.house.gov",276,102,59,40,0,1,2,47

Major Burkett served heroically as a member of the 24th Expeditionary Force in Morocco as an Osprey pilot. In 2012, a plane crash claimed one of his legs. His wife Melissa, who also is a former Marine, has been by his side since Day One, along with their loving six children. While Major Burkett may never fly again, he already soars high above most of us. It was his spirit of service and patriotism that led him to start a program at Fort Belvoir for adaptive archery for his fellow wounded warriors.   I was also proud to submit into the congressional record a poem penned by Albert Carey Caswell in Major Burkett's honor. It is people just like him - citizens who put themselves in danger to protect the rest of us - who deserve to be celebrated by our country every day.
