The post chose Congressman Comer because he was one of only 12 Congressmen who hosted a town hall event that week, and the only Congressman who hosted more than one.

Their reporter was very professional, spent three full days meeting real people throughout KY-1, and did several fact checks with Congressman Comer before the story was published. It was very refreshing for the Congressman to see a credible reporter with a real newspaper write an accurate account of President Trump's status among the people in KY-1.

Our budget isnât just about cuts, itâs about helping hard-working Americans and defending our national security. We set the stage for the first meaningful tax reform in more than 30 years and regulatory reform that gets Washington bureaucrats out of the way of job creators and innovators.
