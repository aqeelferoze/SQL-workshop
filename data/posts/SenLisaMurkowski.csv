This is a day where we remember the victims, survivors, and heroes of the Holocaust, ensuring that their stories never be forgotten. The depravity and terror unleashed by the Nazi Regime has forever left a wound on humanity that will never fully go away, yet we work on healing this wound every day by educating others on what happened, ensuring that the atrocities never occur again. We will never forget the men, women and children whose lives ended too soon, as we remember how they lived, and how they died.    Amidst the horror and destruction that was the Holocaust, stories of hope and the perseverance of the human spirit appeared through the clouds of despair. It is crucial that we not only remember the lives of those we lost and those who suffered, but also the heroes who emerged from the darkness to try to make the world a little bit better. As Miep Gies, the heroine who hid Anne Frank, her family, and other Jews during the Holocaust once elegantly stated, “Even an ordinary secretary or a teenager can, within their own small ways, turn on a small light in a dark room.""

Susan was not only the first woman to win the Iditarod multiple times -- 3 of her 4 wins were consecutive – she was a fighter in every aspect of the word, being one of the first to summit Denali with a dog team. She was known for taking the best care of her dogs, and her training and treatment of her dogs revolutionized the sport. She lost her battle to leukemia in 2006, but we will continue to remember the life and legacy of Susan Butcher, an inspiration to Alaskans and women across the globe.","photo","https://www.facebook.com/SenLisaMurkowski/photos/a.10150144271130291.399331.25271170290/10158271214325291/?type=3",NA,402,23,117,76,0,0,3,0

The authority to manage our fish and wildlife -- through decisions based on sound science, and that make sense for our local communities -- is something that Alaskans take very seriously. We did so responsibly for decades, up until the National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service recently proposed regulations to take that authority away from us.

That will require members on both sides of the aisle to roll up their sleeves and take this to the open committee process where it belongs. The individual market in states like Alaska and in rural communities across America has continued to deteriorate since we last voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Alaskans have seen their premiums increase over 200 percent, only one insurer remains on our individual market, and the state was forced to enact a costly reinsurance program to keep our sole remaining provider from leaving. At the same time, the coverage offered on the exchange has become coverage in name only for too many Alaskans with premiums close to $1,000 a month on average and many facing deductibles approaching $10,000. Repealing the ACA without a clear path forward just creates confusion and greater uncertainty. As I stated earlier this year, I cannot vote to proceed to repeal the ACA without reform that allows people the choice they want, the affordability they need and the quality of care they deserve.","status",NA,NA,2072,1562,146,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Natural disasters can be damaging to the grid and cause real hardships for people when they lose electricity. One key takeaway is that proper vegetation management around power lines reduces wildfires, which is why it is important for utilities and federal agencies to cooperate so this important work can be conducted in a time-sensitive manner. To help protect our lands and our families, Senator Maria Cantwell and I included a vegetation measure in our broad, bipartisan energy and natural resources bill, which aims to bring timeliness to the federal process for vegetation management and provide expedited access to utilities during emergency situations.","link","http://bit.ly/2yqfPGD","bit.ly",211,315,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Juan was a part of a range of projects, from acting as CG Liaison Officer at the Operations Command Center to working with FEMA to transport critical goods, fuel, and personnel in and out of the area. He was also able to support his hometown of San Lorenzo by providing families, including his own, with much needed water, food, and debris cleanup.   When asked for his personal insight after spending time on the ground, Juan told us that the situation is very complicated and things are progressing, but very slowly. “Overall, I think that the biggest issues still facing the island are the need for energy and water, especially for those towns outside of San Juan. It is difficult to piece your life back together and to carry on with your normal day to day without the basic necessities. From my experiences in San Lorenzo, the lack of electricity made everything more difficult. The supermarkets were very limited on what they were carrying because those that were open were running on generators. There were long lines, no ATM system- and without cash, you were out of luck. There are no, or very limited meats, and if there were, they cost 10 times their normal price. The schools could only open for half a day, and they were not serving lunch.”  I am so thankful for Juan’s willingness to serve Puerto Rico and the United States Coast Guard in this capacity and even more thankful to have him as a part of my staff.

Many of the cases of domestic violence, rape, or violent crimes simply go unreported in Indian Country, and this is something that has to change. I believe bringing these bills to the table is a good start in addressing a variety of wrongs that exist in Indian Country and how the federal government can assist or flat-out do a better job. We need to give these issues the attention they deserve, we need coordination across federal agencies, and we need to ensure we have robust victim services to help victims get through the challenges they face.","video","https://www.facebook.com/SenLisaMurkowski/videos/10159440127120291/",NA,144,45,37,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Opioid addiction has become one of the most devastating public health issues confronting our nation. It is impacting everyone, destroying families, spurring crime, hurting our economy, and leading to the tragic deaths of far too many. The impacts of this epidemic are far reaching and fighting it will require all of us, including federal, state, tribal and local governments, as well as families, communities, and individuals to work together. Within my own state, Governor Walker declared the opioid epidemic a public health crisis in February, and has since worked to take practical steps to combat this crisis. Today’s declaration and the emphasis it brings is another important step which I hope will encourage more collaboration and coordination in our efforts. I remain dedicated to working alongside Alaskans in this fight against opioid addiction and substance abuse and will keep fighting for the resources we need.","link","https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/10/26/president-donald-j-trump-taking-action-drug-addiction-and-opioid-crisis","whitehouse.gov",195,253,17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

And it’s time to open the non-wilderness 1002 Area to responsible development, for the benefit of all Alaskans and Americans.","video","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mup5w8l1zFY&feature=youtu.be",NA,172,1288,32,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The passage of this bill marks a defining moment in our nation’s history. In addition to reforming the tax code, Title II of the bill, which I authored, opens the non-wilderness 1002 Area of ANWR to responsible energy development. We have fought to open the 1002 Area for a very long time, and now, our day has finally arrived. I thank all who kept this effort alive over the decades and for the efforts of my colleagues,  Congressman Young and Senator Sullivan. This is a major victory for Alaska that will help us fulfill the promises of our statehood and give us renewed hope for growth and prosperity.","link","http://bit.ly/2kvhhSG","bit.ly",233,979,47,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
