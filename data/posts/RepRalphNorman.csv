After being sworn in as a Member of Congress on Monday, I’ve been busy learning the ropes, and setting up the D.C. and District Offices. I’m proud to say that this week the House passed 2 important pieces of legislation that will combat illegal immigration:  H.R. 3003 - No Sanctuary for Criminals Act: Clarifies ICE detainer authority by establishing probable cause standards to issue detainers for the first time. Withholds federal grant dollars from cities/jurisdictions that violate federal law (i.e. if officers are prohibited from communicating with ICE). Allows victims of crime to sue cities/municipalities that refuse to comply. Contains Sarah and Grant’s Law – ensuring illegal aliens convicted drunk driving are detained.  H.R. 3004 - Kate’s Law: Amends section 276 of the Immigration and Nationality Act relating to reentry of removed aliens. This law enhances penalties for deported felons who return to the US.","status",NA,NA,35,3,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dodd-Frank has impeded the ability of our community banks and credit unions to provide lower and middle class Americans the assistance they need to buy homes and build their businesses.   The Financial CHOICE Act, passed by the House of Representatives earlier this year, takes critical steps towards easing these burdens on lenders and getting real Americans the support they need to pursue the American Dream.  https://youtu.be/5r2L4HeiS0Q","video","https://youtu.be/5r2L4HeiS0Q",NA,28,13,1,0,0,0,0,0

This budget will reduce spending by $5.4 trillion over a 10- year window. It does not expand the size of federal government. It does not encroach on state or local authority.

Ralph Norman","2017-10-20","2017-10-20 18:49:04","Yesterday, I testified before the US International Trade Commission (ITC) regarding a Section 201 “safeguards” case. In the case, Whirlpool alleges Samsung and LG have caused injury to domestic markets by importing high volumes of large residential washers and their parts. Whirlpool is seeking heavily restrictive tariffs and limitations on their own competition.   The government shouldn’t jump into markets to restrict competition. This is a textbook example of the government’s ability to pick winners and losers and why they shouldn’t be able to do so.   This could have a large impact on the developing Newberry Samsung facility, which is set to create nearly 1000 new jobs in South Carolina’s 5th district. Samsung has already demonstrated investment in the state by making large investments in the Charleston Fisher House, an organization supporting veterans and their families in our state.

This is a critical first step to achieving comprehensive #taxreform and making the American economy great again.   Our nation has not significantly reformed our tax code in more than three decades, allowing the tax code to explode in complexity and unnecessarily burden hardworking American families and businesses.  The unified framework unveiled earlier this year will simplify the tax code for everyone, eliminate wasteful tax loopholes, and reduce taxes on businesses.Under this plan, the average family will see an increase in income between $4,000 and $9,000 annually.  While I believe that this budget is necessary to spur economic growth and increase wages, I am disappointed that the Senate removed the $203 billion of mandatory spending cuts given the challenge the national debt poses to the United States.   However, we should not make the perfect the enemy of the good, and I understand that issues as complex as the budget and tax reform require compromise.","video","https://www.facebook.com/RepRalphNorman/videos/366346417152496/",NA,72,25,9,7,0,0,0,7

Small businesses truly are the gears that keep our economy moving, and when they suffer, our economy suffers.  Since 2015, when the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) adopted an expanded definition of the “joint employer” standard – upending decades of precedent and redefining who an employer is – there has been much confusion and ambiguity. For example, since then, there have been over 65,000 letters sent to Congress expressing confusion and asking for clarity in the aftermath of this rule.  Locally owned franchises are America’s unseen small businesses, and in my district alone, there are roughly 2,000 establishments that provide over 15,000 jobs with an economic output of over 1 billion dollars. #Smallbusiness development, economic growth, and entrepreneurs will continue to be hurt by the NLRB’s excessively broad definition of “joint-employer” until Congress finds a concrete definition – which this piece of legislation will do.   The Save Local Business Act provides clarity for small and local businesses as to what it means to be a “joint employer,” restoring necessary clarity for employers and employees alike. I am proud to have voted for this bipartisan bill which helps small businesses all across the nation.","status",NA,NA,49,14,1,1,0,0,0,0
