Both women and men are at a high risk of being sexually assaulted while in college and they often face barriers to coming forward and reporting incidents, putting others at risk of attack by repeat offenders. Sexual assault is one of the most underreported crimes in our country and we can’t afford to roll back protections for survivors of campus sexual assault. Our focus must be on working to foster a system that supports victims.

This budget proposal should raise red flags for anyone who wants to grow our middle class, create good paying jobs, protect human health and our environment, and fight climate change. We can’t turn back the clock on the progress we’ve made in recent years to get our economy pointed in the right direction and this budget is little more than a return to the same failed policies of the past. President Trump needs to seriously reconsider this approach and focus on crafting a budget proposal that benefits all Americans, not just those at the very top.   In New Hampshire, we know the serious impact toxic contamination can have on drinking water, public health, and quality of life. Slashing thirty one percent of the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget will only make defending public health and our environment more difficult. Cutting the Department of Health and Human Services by thirteen percent will eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and harm programs like Meals on Wheels and home visits that our seniors and low-income families rely on. This budget cuts the Department of Agriculture by more than twenty percent, reducing support for our small family farms, rural development programs, and the National Forest System. Investing in our children is one of the most important ways we can ensure a brighter future for our nation. A fourteen percent cut to the Department of Education just doesn’t make sense.  Eliminating Community Development Block Grants will hurt the ability of our communities to plan and invest in the future.  Weatherization programs are critical in New Hampshire and cuts to the Department of Energy would eliminate the Weatherization Assistance Program entirely. These are just a few examples of the many negative impacts this budget would have on New Hampshire. I strongly oppose this preliminary budget proposal, and for the benefit of our country, I urge my colleagues to do the same.","status",NA,NA,146,36,16,0,0,0,3,8

Yesterday, I stood with my colleagues from the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, to call for action to address climate change. I strongly believe that climate change is one of the greatest threats we face as a state, a nation, and as a world. The United States should be a leader in addressing this global crisis, and it is deeply troubling that the current Administration seems focused on undermining our ability to remain at the forefront of this issue. Climate change is real and so is the science behind it. It's not just an environmental issue, it's a matter of remaining economically competitive. If we deny climate change, and stay focused on the technologies of the past, we cede the clean energy technology and jobs of the future to other nations.   We must leave future generations with a healthy world to live in, and it's our responsibility to stand up and use our voices to protect the environment. We can't allow partisan politics to get in the way of maintaining clean air and clean water. I am committed to this fight and I know you are too.  I hope you have a great weekend!","photo","https://www.facebook.com/CongresswomanAnnieKuster/photos/a.115668505272840.19488.115543081952049/738969866276031/?type=3",NA,58,12,1,4,0,0,0,0

We can never forget the sacrifices of those brave servicemembers. Their spirit of courage and commitment to our nation and freedom is carried on in the men and women who serve our nation in uniform.   My father Malcolm McLane flew over the beaches of Normandy on D-Day. You can read a letter he wrote home days after the invasion that appeared in the Concord Monitor on June 6, 2004:  Overcast or not, it's time to fly   Malcolm McLane, now a Concord lawyer, joined the Army Air Force in 1943. On June 6, 1944, he was a 19-year-old fighter pilot stationed in England near the shortest route across the English Channel to France. Almost immediately after Lt. McLane took off (he flew 72 missions in all), he could see the coast of France. His job on D-Day was to patrol the landing beaches in his single-seat P-47 Thunderbolt and challenge any German planes that tried to strafe the Allied assault force. This proved unnecessary, as the Germans, apparently fooled about where and when the invasion was coming, did not contest the landing from the air. A few days later, McLane wrote a letter to his family describing his bird's-eye glimpse of the great invasion. Here is that letter:  By MALCOLM McLANE  For the Monitor  It's three o'clock, Tuesday morning, June 6, 1944. Someone is shaking you in your blanket roll, but you're too sleepy to get up, for you didn't get to bed until midnight and it was after one before the talking quieted down and you got to sleep.  Then the bright light goes on in your face, and you remember what you were told in that three-hour-long, secret briefing last night: ""Today is D-Day!""  You tumble out as best you can, put on extra socks and heavy shoes from force of habit, for someday you may have to walk back. There's some hot coffee and an egg in the mess tent, then you pile into jeeps and trucks and hurry to the line, where the ground crews have already been warming up the planes.  There's your Mae West to put on, your helmet and goggles and chute to put in the plane, before you pack into the squadron briefing tent and get courses and instructions regarding your mission.  There's no comment on the weather, as there usually is, for it's obviously terrible. Ordinarily the mission would be scratched, but there's no canceling this one.  Fifteen minutes before start-engine time, you're in your plane checking everything and getting buckled in. It's still dark, for the sun isn't due to rise for over an hour and there won't be much twilight with this solid overcast and misty rain with its low ceiling and visibility.  Belly tanks cause some trouble as you taxi out, but there's no waiting for stragglers. Those who can make it are off the ground and circling over the field, trying to get into formation. It's no easy thing, and many wander home alone. Once you've set course, you must climb up through the overcast on instruments.  The formation breaks up even more, and when you break out on top, headed into a full moon and a clear sky, you find yourself alone on your element leader's wing. The rest have popped up through the blanket of clouds on their own and are doing their best to find the patrol area separately. Navigation is a matter of compass headings and timing, for there are no landmarks here over this ocean of white.  To the east the sky gets lighter all the time. After an hour occasional breaks appear below, and the two of you spiral down to reconnoiter. It's France all right, but where? A radio call and a fix, and soon you're given a heading to target.  Below the clouds it's murky again, but the light behind you is getting pinker and the fleecy clouds at the bottom of the overcast are a lovely soft red. Below, ships begin to appear, their guns flashing in the darkness, while the rising sun brings out their forms gradually and makes the water a deep red. The air is still misty and the visibility poor, but this only adds to the sun's reddish glare.  For another hour you patrol back and forth over the beachhead-to-be as the big guns pound away. And then when you're about to leave - your gas is getting low - a little fleet of boats leaves the great fleet offshore, passes the outermost ring of destroyers and heads for the beaches.  As you head back across the channel to England, the scattered small wakes of the landing craft move toward the shore. In another few minutes the invasion will have begun.  More planes will relieve you, and many more ships will follow those first boats, but that hour before H-hour will be a never-forgotten memory of this war, whose other details I will willingly forget. My part was nil, for there was no opposition from the air, but our mission was carried out and the beachhead won.

Dr. Sites recently authored a groundbreaking study detailing the extent of opioid prescribing for people with mental illness.  With the intense political debate going on in Washington over healthcare, it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that this is ultimately about real people. The Affordable Care Act gave Granite Staters access to healthcare, and it guaranteed that essential benefits would be covered in their plans. The importance of having access to mental health services and substance use treatment cannot be overstated.

This is despite the fact there is no evidence of such fraud. Rather than protecting our democracy, voter suppression efforts threaten to undermine the legitimate right of people to exercise their self-determination at the ballot box. The extreme bias of this commission was on full display in an op-ed written by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, in which he pointed to the use of out-of-state licenses to vote as proof of widespread voter fraud in New Hampshire. This conclusion by Secretary Kobach is a false assumption and ignores New Hampshire Law. The 2015 New Hampshire Supreme Court case Annemarie Guare v. State of New Hampshire ruled that these voters, specifically college students, have a constitutional right to exercise domicile in New Hampshire and vote while they live here to attend college. The accusations levied by Secretary Kobach are an insult to thousands of local officials and volunteers, both Republican and Democrat, who ensure our free and fair elections in New Hampshire and make the Granite State worthy of being the first-in-the-nation presidential primary.

Today and always, I especially want to express my gratitude to the men and women who are spending the holidays away from family serving to defend our freedoms.   As we gather with our families, friends and loved ones to celebrate the season and the start of 2018, let us take a moment to reach out to our neighbors and spread the warmth of the season to all. Simply offering a smile, a warm meal or a helping hand with everyday tasks can make a world of difference.  Though this past year has been marked by much partisan division, I have focused on working together with all my colleagues to get real results for all Granite Staters. I’ve had legislation signed into law that will address challenges at the Department of Veterans Affairs and improve our response to the opioid epidemic. I’m working to boost jobs and our economy through expanded trade and tourism with Canada. We’ve come together, both Republican and Democrat, to begin to change the all too prevalent culture of sexual harassment and assault. And we’ve pushed back against efforts to threaten the healthcare of millions of Americans and thousands of people in New Hampshire.  Over the past year, thousands of you have written to my office or called to share your ideas and concerns. Hearing all of you speak out in favor of fairness, justice, and helping those in need leaves me hopeful for the coming year. I’ll continue to fight for you and for everyone in the Granite State.  Thank you for everything you do to make New Hampshire such a wonderful place to live.
