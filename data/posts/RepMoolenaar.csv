Current practice at the VA takes away a veteran’s Second Amendment rights if they appoint a fiduciary to handle their financial affairs because the VA reports the veteran as being “mentally incompetent” to the FBI’s National Criminal Background Check System.   That designation could result in veterans being blocked from legally purchasing a firearm. A veteran may apply for relief through the VA, but that puts a bureaucrat at the department in charge of making the final decision on a veteran’s Second Amendment rights.  Americans’ treasure their constitutional rights and the Second Amendment is no exception. There is already a legal process through the courts to prohibit the mentally ill from buying firearms.
