Practice writing SQL queries that answer the following questions using the database we just created:

Who wrote the post that was shared the most times during this period? What does it say?

```{r}
library(DBI)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "facebook-db.sqlite")

dbGetQuery(db, 
           "SELECT screen_name, message
           ...")

```

What about the post with the most comments?

```{r}


```

Which was the post that received the most likes in January of 2017?

```{r}


```

What was the photo posted by a Member of Congress that received the most "angry" reactions?

```{r}

```

Replicate the previous analysis for Democrats and then for Republicans. What do you learn?

```{r}

```

Which was the post mentioning "Trump" that was shared the most? And which was the post that received the most "love" reactions?

```{r}

```
